=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::Cluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::Cluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ACLName => $value, ..., TLSEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::Cluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ACLName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains all of the attributes of a specific cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ACLName => Str

The name of the Access Control List associated with this cluster.


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

When set to true, the cluster will automatically receive minor engine
version upgrades after launch.


=head2 AvailabilityMode => Str

Indicates if the cluster has a Multi-AZ configuration (multiaz) or not
(singleaz).


=head2 ClusterEndpoint => L<Paws::MemoryDB::Endpoint>

The cluster's configuration endpoint


=head2 DataTiering => Str

Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for clusters using
the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set when using r6gd nodes.
For more information, see Data tiering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/data-tiering.html).


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the cluster


=head2 Engine => Str

The name of the engine used by the cluster.


=head2 EnginePatchVersion => Str

The Redis OSS engine patch version used by the cluster


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The Redis OSS engine version used by the cluster


=head2 IpDiscovery => Str

The mechanism that the cluster uses to discover IP addresses. Returns
'ipv4' when DNS endpoints resolve to IPv4 addresses, or 'ipv6' when DNS
endpoints resolve to IPv6 addresses.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the cluster


=head2 MaintenanceWindow => Str

Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster
is performed. It is specified as a range in the format
ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window
is a 60 minute period.


=head2 MultiRegionClusterName => Str

The name of the multi-Region cluster that this cluster belongs to.


=head2 Name => Str

The user-supplied name of the cluster. This identifier is a unique key
that identifies a cluster.


=head2 NetworkType => Str

The IP address type for the cluster. Returns 'ipv4' for IPv4 only,
'ipv6' for IPv6 only, or 'dual-stack' if the cluster supports both IPv4
and IPv6 addressing.


=head2 NodeType => Str

The cluster's node type


=head2 NumberOfShards => Int

The number of shards in the cluster


=head2 ParameterGroupName => Str

The name of the parameter group used by the cluster


=head2 ParameterGroupStatus => Str

The status of the parameter group used by the cluster, for example
'active' or 'applying'.


=head2 PendingUpdates => L<Paws::MemoryDB::ClusterPendingUpdates>

A group of settings that are currently being applied.


=head2 SecurityGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MemoryDB::SecurityGroupMembership>]

A list of security groups used by the cluster


=head2 Shards => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MemoryDB::Shard>]

A list of shards that are members of the cluster.


=head2 SnapshotRetentionLimit => Int

The number of days for which MemoryDB retains automatic snapshots
before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRetentionLimit to
5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being
deleted.


=head2 SnapshotWindow => Str

The daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins taking a
daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If you do not
specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an appropriate
time range.


=head2 SnsTopicArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS notification topic


=head2 SnsTopicStatus => Str

The SNS topic must be in Active status to receive notifications


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the cluster. For example, Available, Updating, Creating.


=head2 SubnetGroupName => Str

The name of the subnet group used by the cluster


=head2 TLSEnabled => Bool

A flag to indicate if In-transit encryption is enabled
