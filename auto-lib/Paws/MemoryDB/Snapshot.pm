=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::Snapshot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::Snapshot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::Snapshot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a copy of an entire cluster as of the time when the snapshot
was taken.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the snapshot.


=head2 ClusterConfiguration => L<Paws::MemoryDB::ClusterConfiguration>

The configuration of the cluster from which the snapshot was taken


=head2 DataTiering => Str

Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for clusters using
the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set when using r6gd nodes.
For more information, see Data tiering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/memorydb/latest/devguide/data-tiering.html).
