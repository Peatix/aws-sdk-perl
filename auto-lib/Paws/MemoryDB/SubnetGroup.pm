=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::SubnetGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::SubnetGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::SubnetGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the output of one of the following operations:

A subnet group is a collection of subnets (typically private) that you
can designate for your clusters running in an Amazon Virtual Private
Cloud (VPC) environment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the subnet group.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the subnet group


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the subnet group


=head2 Subnets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MemoryDB::Subnet>]

A list of subnets associated with the subnet group.


=head2 SupportedNetworkTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The network types supported by this subnet group. Returns an array of
strings that can include 'ipv4', 'ipv6', or both, indicating the IP
address types that can be used for clusters deployed in this subnet
group.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID) of the subnet
group.
