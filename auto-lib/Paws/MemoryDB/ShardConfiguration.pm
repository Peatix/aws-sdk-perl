=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::ShardConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::ShardConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReplicaCount => $value, ..., Slots => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::ShardConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReplicaCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Shard configuration options. Each shard configuration has the
following: Slots and ReplicaCount.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReplicaCount => Int

The number of read replica nodes in this shard.


=head2 Slots => Str

A string that specifies the keyspace for a particular node group.
Keyspaces range from 0 to 16,383. The string is in the format
