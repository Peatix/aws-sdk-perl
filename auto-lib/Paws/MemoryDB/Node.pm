=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::Node

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::Node object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZone => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::Node object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents an individual node within a cluster. Each node runs its own
instance of the cluster's protocol-compliant caching software.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone in which the node resides


=head2 CreateTime => Str

The date and time when the node was created.


=head2 Endpoint => L<Paws::MemoryDB::Endpoint>

The hostname for connecting to this node.


=head2 Name => Str

The node identifier. A node name is a numeric identifier (0001, 0002,
etc.). The combination of cluster name, shard name and node name
uniquely identifies every node used in a customer's Amazon account.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the service update on the node
