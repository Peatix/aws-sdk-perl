=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::ACL

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::ACL object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., UserNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::ACL object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Access Control List. You can authenticate users with Access Contol
Lists. ACLs enable you to control cluster access by grouping users.
These Access control lists are designed as a way to organize access to
clusters.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACL


=head2 Clusters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of clusters associated with the ACL.


=head2 MinimumEngineVersion => Str

The minimum engine version supported for the ACL


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the Access Control List


=head2 PendingChanges => L<Paws::MemoryDB::ACLPendingChanges>

A list of updates being applied to the ACL.
