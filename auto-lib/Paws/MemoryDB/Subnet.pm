=head1 NAME

Paws::MemoryDB::Subnet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MemoryDB::Subnet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZone => $value, ..., SupportedNetworkTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MemoryDB::Subnet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the subnet associated with a cluster. This parameter refers
to subnets defined in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and
used with MemoryDB.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZone => L<Paws::MemoryDB::AvailabilityZone>

The Availability Zone where the subnet resides


=head2 Identifier => Str

The unique identifier for the subnet.


=head2 SupportedNetworkTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The network types supported by this subnet. Returns an array of strings
that can include 'ipv4', 'ipv6', or both, indicating whether the subnet
supports IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual-stack deployments.
