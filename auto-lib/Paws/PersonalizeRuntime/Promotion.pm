=head1 NAME

Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::Promotion

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::Promotion object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FilterArn => $value, ..., PercentPromotedItems => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::Promotion object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FilterArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information on a promotion. A promotion defines additional
business rules that apply to a configurable subset of recommended
items.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FilterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the filter used by the promotion.
This filter defines the criteria for promoted items. For more
information, see Promotion filters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/promoting-items.html#promotion-filters).


=head2 FilterValues => L<Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::FilterValues>

The values to use when promoting items. For each placeholder parameter
in your promotion's filter expression, provide the parameter name (in
matching case) as a key and the filter value(s) as the corresponding
value. Separate multiple values for one parameter with a comma.

For filter expressions that use an C<INCLUDE> element to include items,
you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the
expression. For filters with expressions that use an C<EXCLUDE> element
to exclude items, you can omit the C<filter-values>. In this case,
Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter
recommendations.

For more information on creating filters, see Filtering recommendations
and user segments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/filter.html).


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the promotion.


=head2 PercentPromotedItems => Int

The percentage of recommended items to apply the promotion to.
