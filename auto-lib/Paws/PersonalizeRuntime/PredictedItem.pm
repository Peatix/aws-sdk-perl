This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::PredictedItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ItemId => $value, ..., Score => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::PredictedItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ItemId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that identifies an item.

The and APIs return a list of C<PredictedItem>s.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 Metadata => L<Paws::PersonalizeRuntime::Metadata>

Metadata about the item from your Items dataset.


=head2 PromotionName => Str

=item *

Promoted item - Indicates the item was included as part of a promotion
that you applied in your recommendation request.

=item *

Exploration - Indicates the item was included with exploration. With
exploration, recommendations include items with less interactions data
or relevance for the user. For more information about exploration, see
Exploration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/use-case-recipe-features.html#about-exploration).

=item *

Popular item - Indicates the item was included as a placeholder popular
item. If you use a filter, depending on how many recommendations the
filter removes, Amazon Personalize might add placeholder items to meet
the C<numResults> for your recommendation request. These items are
popular items, based on interactions data, that satisfy your filter
criteria. They don't have a relevance score for the user.

=head2 Score => Num

A numeric representation of the model's certainty that the item will be
the next user selection. For more information on scoring logic, see
