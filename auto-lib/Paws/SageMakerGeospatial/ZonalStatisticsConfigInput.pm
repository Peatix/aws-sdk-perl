=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ZonalStatisticsConfigInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ZonalStatisticsConfigInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Statistics => $value, ..., ZoneS3PathKmsKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ZonalStatisticsConfigInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Statistics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure representing input configuration of ZonalStatistics
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Statistics => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

List of zonal statistics to compute.


=head2 TargetBands => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Bands used in the operation. If no target bands are specified, it uses
all bands available input.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ZoneS3Path => Str

The Amazon S3 path pointing to the GeoJSON containing the polygonal
zones.


=head2 ZoneS3PathKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or an ID of a Amazon Web Services Key
Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker
uses to decrypt your output artifacts with Amazon S3 server-side
encryption. The SageMaker execution role must have
C<kms:GenerateDataKey> permission.

The C<KmsKeyId> can be any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:E<lt>regionE<gt>:E<lt>accountE<gt>:key/E<lt>key-id-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890abE<gt>">

in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
KMS) documentation.
