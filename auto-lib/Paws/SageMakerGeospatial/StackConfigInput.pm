=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::StackConfigInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::StackConfigInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OutputResolution => $value, ..., TargetBands => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::StackConfigInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OutputResolution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input structure for Stacking Operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OutputResolution => L<Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::OutputResolutionStackInput>

The structure representing output resolution (in target georeferenced
units) of the result of stacking operation.


=head2 TargetBands => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of bands to be stacked in the specified order. When the
parameter is not provided, all the available bands in the data
collection are stacked in the alphabetical order of their asset names.
