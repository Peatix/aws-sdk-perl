=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::CustomIndicesInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::CustomIndicesInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Operations => $value, ..., Operations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::CustomIndicesInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Input object defining the custom BandMath indices to compute.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Operations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::Operation>]

A list of BandMath indices to compute.
