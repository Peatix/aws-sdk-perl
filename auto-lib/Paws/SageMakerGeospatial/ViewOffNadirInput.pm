=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewOffNadirInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewOffNadirInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LowerBound => $value, ..., UpperBound => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewOffNadirInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LowerBound

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input structure for specifying ViewOffNadir property filter.
ViewOffNadir refers to the angle from the sensor between nadir
(straight down) and the scene center. Measured in degrees (0-90).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LowerBound => Num

The minimum value for ViewOffNadir property filter. This filters items
having ViewOffNadir greater than or equal to this value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpperBound => Num

The maximum value for ViewOffNadir property filter. This filters items
having ViewOffNadir lesser than or equal to this value.
