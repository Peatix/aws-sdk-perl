=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewSunAzimuthInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewSunAzimuthInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LowerBound => $value, ..., UpperBound => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::ViewSunAzimuthInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LowerBound

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input structure for specifying ViewSunAzimuth property filter.
ViewSunAzimuth refers to the Sun azimuth angle. From the scene center
point on the ground, this is the angle between truth north and the sun.
Measured clockwise in degrees (0-360).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LowerBound => Num

The minimum value for ViewSunAzimuth property filter. This filters
items having ViewSunAzimuth greater than or equal to this value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpperBound => Num

The maximum value for ViewSunAzimuth property filter. This filters
items having ViewSunAzimuth lesser than or equal to this value.
