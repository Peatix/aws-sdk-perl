=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::BandMathConfigInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::BandMathConfigInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomIndices => $value, ..., PredefinedIndices => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::BandMathConfigInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomIndices

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Input structure for the BandMath operation type. Defines Predefined and
CustomIndices to be computed using BandMath.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomIndices => L<Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::CustomIndicesInput>

CustomIndices that are computed.


=head2 PredefinedIndices => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or many of the supported predefined indices to compute. Allowed
values: C<NDVI>, C<EVI2>, C<MSAVI>, C<NDWI>, C<NDMI>, C<NDSI>, and
C<WDRVI>.
