=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::Properties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::Properties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EoCloudCover => $value, ..., ViewSunElevation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerGeospatial::Properties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EoCloudCover

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Properties associated with the Item.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EoCloudCover => Num

Estimate of cloud cover.


=head2 LandsatCloudCoverLand => Num

Land cloud cover for Landsat Data Collection.


=head2 Platform => Str

Platform property. Platform refers to the unique name of the specific
platform the instrument is attached to. For satellites it is the name
of the satellite, eg. landsat-8 (Landsat-8), sentinel-2a.


=head2 ViewOffNadir => Num

The angle from the sensor between nadir (straight down) and the scene
center. Measured in degrees (0-90).


=head2 ViewSunAzimuth => Num

The sun azimuth angle. From the scene center point on the ground, this
is the angle between truth north and the sun. Measured clockwise in
degrees (0-360).


=head2 ViewSunElevation => Num

The sun elevation angle. The angle from the tangent of the scene center
point to the sun. Measured from the horizon in degrees (-90-90).
Negative values indicate the sun is below the horizon, e.g. sun
elevation of -10E<deg> means the data was captured during nautical
twilight
(https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/different-types-twilight.html).
