=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaPackage::CmafEncryption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaPackage::CmafEncryption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConstantInitializationVector => $value, ..., SpekeKeyProvider => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaPackage::CmafEncryption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConstantInitializationVector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Common Media Application Format (CMAF) encryption configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConstantInitializationVector => Str

An optional 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character
string, used in conjunction with the key for encrypting blocks. If you
don't specify a value, then MediaPackage creates the constant
initialization vector (IV).


=head2 EncryptionMethod => Str




=head2 KeyRotationIntervalSeconds => Int

Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SpekeKeyProvider => L<Paws::MediaPackage::SpekeKeyProvider>





=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::MediaPackage>
