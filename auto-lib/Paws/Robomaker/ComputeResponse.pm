=head1 NAME

Paws::Robomaker::ComputeResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Robomaker::ComputeResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeType => $value, ..., SimulationUnitLimit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Robomaker::ComputeResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Compute information for the simulation job

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeType => Str

Compute type response information for the simulation job.


=head2 GpuUnitLimit => Int

Compute GPU unit limit for the simulation job. It is the same as the
number of GPUs allocated to the SimulationJob.


=head2 SimulationUnitLimit => Int

The simulation unit limit. Your simulation is allocated CPU and memory
proportional to the supplied simulation unit limit. A simulation unit
is 1 vcpu and 2GB of memory. You are only billed for the SU utilization
you consume up to the maximum value provided. The default is 15.
