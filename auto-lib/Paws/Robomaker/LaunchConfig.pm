=head1 NAME

Paws::Robomaker::LaunchConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Robomaker::LaunchConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., StreamUI => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Robomaker::LaunchConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a launch configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If you've specified C<General> as the value for your
C<RobotSoftwareSuite>, you can use this field to specify a list of
commands for your container image.

If you've specified C<SimulationRuntime> as the value for your
C<SimulationSoftwareSuite>, you can use this field to specify a list of
commands for your container image.


=head2 EnvironmentVariables => L<Paws::Robomaker::EnvironmentVariableMap>

The environment variables for the application launch.


=head2 LaunchFile => Str

The launch file name.


=head2 PackageName => Str

The package name.


=head2 PortForwardingConfig => L<Paws::Robomaker::PortForwardingConfig>

The port forwarding configuration.


=head2 StreamUI => Bool

Boolean indicating whether a streaming session will be configured for
the application. If C<True>, AWS RoboMaker will configure a connection
so you can interact with your application as it is running in the
simulation. You must configure and launch the component. It must have a
graphical user interface.
