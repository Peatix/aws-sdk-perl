=head1 NAME

Paws::Robomaker::DataSourceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Robomaker::DataSourceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Robomaker::DataSourceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => Str

The location where your files are mounted in the container image.

If you've specified the C<type> of the data source as an C<Archive>,
you must provide an Amazon S3 object key to your archive. The object
key must point to either a C<.zip> or C<.tar.gz> file.

If you've specified the C<type> of the data source as a C<Prefix>, you
provide the Amazon S3 prefix that points to the files that you are
using for your data source.

If you've specified the C<type> of the data source as a C<File>, you
provide the Amazon S3 path to the file that you're using as your data
source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the data source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Bucket => Str

The S3 bucket where the data files are located.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Keys => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of S3 keys identifying the data source files.


=head2 Type => Str

The data type for the data source that you're using for your container
image or simulation job. You can use this field to specify whether your
data source is an Archive, an Amazon S3 prefix, or a file.

If you don't specify a field, the default value is C<File>.
