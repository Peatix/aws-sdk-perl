=head1 NAME

Paws::Robomaker::DataSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Robomaker::DataSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Robomaker::DataSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you've specified the C<type> of the data source as a C<File>, you
provide the Amazon S3 path to the file that you're using as your data
source.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the data source.


=head2 S3Bucket => Str

The S3 bucket where the data files are located.


=head2 S3Keys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Robomaker::S3KeyOutput>]

The list of S3 keys identifying the data source files.


=head2 Type => Str

The data type for the data source that you're using for your container
image or simulation job. You can use this field to specify whether your
data source is an Archive, an Amazon S3 prefix, or a file.
