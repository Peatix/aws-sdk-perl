=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::EncryptionSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::EncryptionSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::EncryptionSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon Keyspaces encrypts and decrypts the table data at rest
transparently and integrates with Key Management Service for storing
and managing the encryption key. You can choose one of the following
KMS keys (KMS keys):

=over

=item *

Amazon Web Services owned key - This is the default encryption type.
The key is owned by Amazon Keyspaces (no additional charge).

=item *

Customer managed key - This key is stored in your account and is
created, owned, and managed by you. You have full control over the
customer managed key (KMS charges apply).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyIdentifier => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed KMS key, for
example C<kms_key_identifier:ARN>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The encryption option specified for the table. You can choose one of
the following KMS keys (KMS keys):

=over

=item *

C<type:AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY> - This key is owned by Amazon Keyspaces.

=item *

C<type:CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KMS_KEY> - This key is stored in your account
and is created, owned, and managed by you. This option requires the
C<kms_key_identifier> of the KMS key in Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
format as input.

=back

The default is C<type:AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY>.
