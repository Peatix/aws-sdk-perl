=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::Tag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::Tag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::Tag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50 tags
to a single Amazon Keyspaces resource.

Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names and values are automatically
assigned the C<aws:> prefix, which the user cannot assign. Amazon Web
Services-assigned tag names do not count towards the tag limit of 50.
User-assigned tag names have the prefix C<user:> in the Cost Allocation
Report. You cannot backdate the application of a tag.

For more information, see Adding tags and labels to Amazon Keyspaces
resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/tagging-keyspaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive. Each Amazon Keyspaces
resource can only have up to one tag with the same key. If you try to
add an existing tag (same key), the existing tag value will be updated
to the new value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Str

The value of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive and can be null.
