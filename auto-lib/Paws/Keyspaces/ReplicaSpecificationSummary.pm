=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicaSpecificationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicaSpecificationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CapacitySpecification => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicaSpecificationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CapacitySpecification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Region-specific settings of a multi-Region table in the specified
Amazon Web Services Region.

If the multi-Region table is using provisioned capacity and has
optional auto scaling policies configured, note that the Region
specific summary returns both read and write capacity settings. But
only Region specific read capacity settings can be configured for a
multi-Region table. In a multi-Region table, your write capacity units
will be synced across all Amazon Web Services Regions to ensure that
there is enough capacity to replicate write events across Regions.

=head2 CapacitySpecification => L<Paws::Keyspaces::CapacitySpecificationSummary>




=head2 Region => Str

=head2 Status => Str

Services Region.
