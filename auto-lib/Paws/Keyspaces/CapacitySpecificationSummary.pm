=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::CapacitySpecificationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::CapacitySpecificationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LastUpdateToPayPerRequestTimestamp => $value, ..., WriteCapacityUnits => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::CapacitySpecificationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LastUpdateToPayPerRequestTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The read/write throughput capacity mode for a table. The options are:

=over

=item *

C<throughputMode:PAY_PER_REQUEST> and

=item *

C<throughputMode:PROVISIONED>.

=back

For more information, see Read/write capacity modes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/ReadWriteCapacityMode.html)
in the I<Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LastUpdateToPayPerRequestTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of the last operation that changed the provisioned
throughput capacity of a table.


=head2 ReadCapacityUnits => Int

The throughput capacity specified for C<read> operations defined in
C<read capacity units> C<(RCUs)>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ThroughputMode => Str

The read/write throughput capacity mode for a table. The options are:

=over

=item *

C<throughputMode:PAY_PER_REQUEST> and

=item *

C<throughputMode:PROVISIONED> - Provisioned capacity mode requires
C<readCapacityUnits> and C<writeCapacityUnits> as input.

=back

The default is C<throughput_mode:PAY_PER_REQUEST>.

For more information, see Read/write capacity modes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/ReadWriteCapacityMode.html)
in the I<Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide>.


=head2 WriteCapacityUnits => Int

The throughput capacity specified for C<write> operations defined in
C<write capacity units> C<(WCUs)>.
