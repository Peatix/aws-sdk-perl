Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicationSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicationSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RegionList => $value, ..., ReplicationStrategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::ReplicationSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RegionList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The replication specification of the keyspace includes:

=over

=item *

C<regionList> - the Amazon Web Services Regions where the keyspace is
replicated in.

=item *

C<replicationStrategy> - the required value is C<SINGLE_REGION> or
C<MULTI_REGION>.
