=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::SchemaDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::SchemaDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllColumns => $value, ..., StaticColumns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::SchemaDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllColumns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the schema of the table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllColumns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Keyspaces::ColumnDefinition>]

The regular columns of the table.


=head2 ClusteringKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Keyspaces::ClusteringKey>]

The columns that are part of the clustering key of the table.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PartitionKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Keyspaces::PartitionKey>]

The columns that are part of the partition key of the table .


=head2 StaticColumns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Keyspaces::StaticColumn>]

The columns that have been defined as C<STATIC>. Static columns store
values that are shared by all rows in the same partition.
