=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::KeyspaceSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::KeyspaceSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyspaceName => $value, ..., ResourceArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::KeyspaceSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyspaceName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the properties of a keyspace.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyspaceName => Str

The name of the keyspace.


=head2 ReplicationRegions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If the C<replicationStrategy> of the keyspace is C<MULTI_REGION>, a
list of replication Regions is returned.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReplicationStrategy => Str

This property specifies if a keyspace is a single Region keyspace or a
multi-Region keyspace. The available values are C<SINGLE_REGION> or
C<MULTI_REGION>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceArn => Str

The unique identifier of the keyspace in the format of an Amazon
Resource Name (ARN).
