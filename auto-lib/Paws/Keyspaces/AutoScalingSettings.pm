=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingDisabled => $value, ..., ScalingPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingDisabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The optional auto scaling settings for a table with provisioned
throughput capacity.

To turn on auto scaling for a table in C<throughputMode:PROVISIONED>,
you must specify the following parameters.

Configure the minimum and maximum capacity units. The auto scaling
policy ensures that capacity never goes below the minimum or above the
maximum range.

=over

=item *

C<minimumUnits>: The minimum level of throughput the table should
always be ready to support. The value must be between 1 and the max
throughput per second quota for your account (40,000 by default).

=item *

C<maximumUnits>: The maximum level of throughput the table should
always be ready to support. The value must be between 1 and the max
throughput per second quota for your account (40,000 by default).

=item *

C<scalingPolicy>: Amazon Keyspaces supports the C<target tracking>
scaling policy. The auto scaling target is the provisioned capacity of
the table.

=over

=item *

C<targetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration>: To define the target
tracking policy, you must define the target value.

=over

=item *

C<targetValue>: The target utilization rate of the table. Amazon
Keyspaces auto scaling ensures that the ratio of consumed capacity to
provisioned capacity stays at or near this value. You define
C<targetValue> as a percentage. A C<double> between 20 and 90.
(Required)

=item *

C<disableScaleIn>: A C<boolean> that specifies if C<scale-in> is
disabled or enabled for the table. This parameter is disabled by
default. To turn on C<scale-in>, set the C<boolean> value to C<FALSE>.
This means that capacity for a table can be automatically scaled down
on your behalf. (Optional)

=item *

C<scaleInCooldown>: A cooldown period in seconds between scaling
activities that lets the table stabilize before another scale in
activity starts. If no value is provided, the default is 0. (Optional)

=item *

C<scaleOutCooldown>: A cooldown period in seconds between scaling
activities that lets the table stabilize before another scale out
activity starts. If no value is provided, the default is 0. (Optional)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingDisabled => Bool

This optional parameter enables auto scaling for the table if set to
C<false>.


=head2 MaximumUnits => Int

Manage costs by specifying the maximum amount of throughput to
provision. The value must be between 1 and the max throughput per
second quota for your account (40,000 by default).


=head2 MinimumUnits => Int

The minimum level of throughput the table should always be ready to
support. The value must be between 1 and the max throughput per second
quota for your account (40,000 by default).


=head2 ScalingPolicy => L<Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingPolicy>

Amazon Keyspaces supports the C<target tracking> auto scaling policy.
With this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling ensures that the
table's ratio of consumed to provisioned capacity stays at or near the
target value that you specify. You define the target value as a
percentage between 20 and 90.
