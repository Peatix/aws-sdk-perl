=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DisableScaleIn => $value, ..., TargetValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DisableScaleIn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The auto scaling policy that scales a table based on the ratio of
consumed to provisioned capacity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DisableScaleIn => Bool

Specifies if C<scale-in> is enabled.

When auto scaling automatically decreases capacity for a table, the
table I<scales in>. When scaling policies are set, they can't scale in
the table lower than its minimum capacity.


=head2 ScaleInCooldown => Int

Specifies a C<scale-in> cool down period.

A cooldown period in seconds between scaling activities that lets the
table stabilize before another scaling activity starts.


=head2 ScaleOutCooldown => Int

Specifies a scale out cool down period.

A cooldown period in seconds between scaling activities that lets the
table stabilize before another scaling activity starts.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetValue => Num

Specifies the target value for the target tracking auto scaling policy.

Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling scales up capacity automatically when
traffic exceeds this target utilization rate, and then back down when
it falls below the target. This ensures that the ratio of consumed
capacity to provisioned capacity stays at or near this value. You
define C<targetValue> as a percentage. A C<double> between 20 and 90.
