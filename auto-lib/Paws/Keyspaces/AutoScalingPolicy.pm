=head1 NAME

Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration => $value, ..., TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Keyspaces::AutoScalingPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon Keyspaces supports the C<target tracking> auto scaling policy.
With this policy, Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling ensures that the
table's ratio of consumed to provisioned capacity stays at or near the
target value that you specify. You define the target value as a
percentage between 20 and 90.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration => L<Paws::Keyspaces::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration>

Auto scaling scales up capacity automatically when traffic exceeds this
target utilization rate, and then back down when it falls below the
target. A C<double> between 20 and 90.
