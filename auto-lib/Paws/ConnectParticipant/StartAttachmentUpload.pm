=head1 NAME

Paws::ConnectParticipant::StartAttachmentUpload - Arguments for method StartAttachmentUpload on L<Paws::ConnectParticipant>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StartAttachmentUpload on the
L<Amazon Connect Participant Service|Paws::ConnectParticipant> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StartAttachmentUpload.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StartAttachmentUpload.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $participant.connect = Paws->service('ConnectParticipant');
    my $StartAttachmentUploadResponse =
      $participant . connect->StartAttachmentUpload(
      AttachmentName        => 'MyAttachmentName',
      AttachmentSizeInBytes => 1,
      ClientToken           => 'MyNonEmptyClientToken',
      ConnectionToken       => 'MyParticipantToken',
      ContentType           => 'MyContentType',

      );

    # Results:
    my $AttachmentId   = $StartAttachmentUploadResponse->AttachmentId;
    my $UploadMetadata = $StartAttachmentUploadResponse->UploadMetadata;

  # Returns a L<Paws::ConnectParticipant::StartAttachmentUploadResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/participant.connect/StartAttachmentUpload>
