This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CompleteAttachmentUpload on the

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $participant.connect = Paws->service('ConnectParticipant');
    my $CompleteAttachmentUploadResponse =
      $participant . connect->CompleteAttachmentUpload(
      AttachmentIds => [
        'MyArtifactId', ...    # min: 1, max: 256
      ],
      ClientToken     => 'MyNonEmptyClientToken',
      ConnectionToken => 'MyParticipantToken',
