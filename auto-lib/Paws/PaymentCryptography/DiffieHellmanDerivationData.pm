=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::DiffieHellmanDerivationData

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::DiffieHellmanDerivationData object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SharedInformation => $value, ..., SharedInformation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::DiffieHellmanDerivationData object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SharedInformation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Derivation data used to derive an ECDH key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SharedInformation => Str

A byte string containing information that binds the ECDH derived key to
the two parties involved or to the context of the key.

It may include details like identities of the two parties deriving the
key, context of the operation, session IDs, and optionally a nonce. It
must not contain zero bytes, and re-using shared information for
multiple ECDH key derivations is not recommended.
