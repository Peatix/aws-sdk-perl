=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., KeyState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metadata about an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Specifies whether the key is enabled.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Exportable => Bool

Specifies whether the key is exportable. This data is immutable after
the key is created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAttributes => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes>

The role of the key, the algorithm it supports, and the cryptographic
operations allowed with the key. This data is immutable after the key
is created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyCheckValue => Str

The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties holding a
given key have the same key or to detect that a key has changed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyState => Str

The state of an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography that is being
created or deleted.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::PaymentCryptography>
