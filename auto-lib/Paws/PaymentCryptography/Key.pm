=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::Key

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::Key object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreateTimestamp => $value, ..., UsageStopTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::Key object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreateTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metadata about an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreateTimestamp => Str

The date and time when the key was created.


=head2 DeletePendingTimestamp => Str

The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
will delete the key. This value is present only when C<KeyState> is
C<DELETE_PENDING> and the key is scheduled for deletion.


=head2 DeleteTimestamp => Str

The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
will delete the key. This value is present only when when the
C<KeyState> is C<DELETE_COMPLETE> and the Amazon Web Services Payment
Cryptography key is deleted.


=head2 DeriveKeyUsage => Str

The cryptographic usage of an ECDH derived key as dened in section
A.5.2 of the TR-31 spec.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Specifies whether the key is enabled.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Exportable => Bool

Specifies whether the key is exportable. This data is immutable after
the key is created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAttributes => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes>

The role of the key, the algorithm it supports, and the cryptographic
operations allowed with the key. This data is immutable after the key
is created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyCheckValue => Str

The key check value (KCV) is used to check if all parties holding a
given key have the same key or to detect that a key has changed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyCheckValueAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to
calculate the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate the key
integrity.

For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8 bytes, each with
value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest
order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the KCV is computed
using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is 16 bytes of zero and
retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyOrigin => Str

The source of the key material. For keys created within Amazon Web
Services Payment Cryptography, the value is
C<AWS_PAYMENT_CRYPTOGRAPHY>. For keys imported into Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography, the value is C<EXTERNAL>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyState => Str

The state of key that is being created or deleted.


=head2 UsageStartTimestamp => Str

The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
will start using the key material for cryptographic operations.


=head2 UsageStopTimestamp => Str

The date and time after which Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
will stop using the key material for cryptographic operations.
