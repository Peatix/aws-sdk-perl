=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::TrustedCertificatePublicKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::TrustedCertificatePublicKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., PublicKeyCertificate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::TrustedCertificatePublicKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for trusted public key certificate import.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the root public key certificate or certificate chain
that signs the trusted public key certificate import.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAttributes => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes>

The role of the key, the algorithm it supports, and the cryptographic
operations allowed with the key. This data is immutable after a trusted
public key is imported.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PublicKeyCertificate => Str

Parameter information for trusted public key certificate import.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::PaymentCryptography>
