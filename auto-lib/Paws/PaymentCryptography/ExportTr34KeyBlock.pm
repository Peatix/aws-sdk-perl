=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr34KeyBlock

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr34KeyBlock object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., WrappingKeyCertificate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr34KeyBlock object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for key material export using the asymmetric
TR-34 key exchange method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the certificate chain that signs the wrapping key
certificate during TR-34 key export.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExportToken => Str

The export token to initiate key export from Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography. It also contains the signing key certificate that
will sign the wrapped key during TR-34 key block generation. Call
GetParametersForExport
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetParametersForExport.html)
to receive an export token. It expires after 7 days. You can use the
same export token to export multiple keys from the same service
account.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyBlockFormat => Str

The format of key block that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
will use during key export.


=head2 KeyBlockHeaders => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyBlockHeaders>

Optional metadata for export associated with the key material. This
data is signed but transmitted in clear text.


=head2 RandomNonce => Str

A random number value that is unique to the TR-34 key block generated
using 2 pass. The operation will fail, if a random nonce value is not
provided for a TR-34 key block generated using 2 pass.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WrappingKeyCertificate => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the wrapping key certificate. Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography uses this certificate to wrap the key under
export.
