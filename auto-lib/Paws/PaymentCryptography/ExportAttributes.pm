=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExportDukptInitialKey => $value, ..., KeyCheckValueAlgorithm => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExportDukptInitialKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The attributes for IPEK generation during export.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExportDukptInitialKey => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportDukptInitialKey>

Parameter information for IPEK export.


=head2 KeyCheckValueAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses to
calculate the key check value (KCV). It is used to validate the key
integrity. Specify KCV for IPEK export only.

For TDES keys, the KCV is computed by encrypting 8 bytes, each with
value of zero, with the key to be checked and retaining the 3 highest
order bytes of the encrypted result. For AES keys, the KCV is computed
using a CMAC algorithm where the input data is 16 bytes of zero and
retaining the 3 highest order bytes of the encrypted result.
