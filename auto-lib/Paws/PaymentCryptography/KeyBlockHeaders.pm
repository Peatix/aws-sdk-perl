=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyBlockHeaders

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyBlockHeaders object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyExportability => $value, ..., OptionalBlocks => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyBlockHeaders object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyExportability

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Optional metadata for export associated with the key material. This
data is signed but transmitted in clear text.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KeyExportability => Str

Specifies subsequent exportability of the key within the key block
after it is received by the receiving party. It can be used to further
restrict exportability of the key after export from Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography.

When set to C<EXPORTABLE>, the key can be subsequently exported by the
receiver under a KEK using TR-31 or TR-34 key block export only. When
set to C<NON_EXPORTABLE>, the key cannot be subsequently exported by
the receiver. When set to C<SENSITIVE>, the key can be exported by the
receiver under a KEK using TR-31, TR-34, RSA wrap and unwrap cryptogram
or using a symmetric cryptogram key export method. For further
information refer to ANSI X9.143-2022
(https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ascx9/ansix91432022).


=head2 KeyModesOfUse => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyModesOfUse>




=head2 KeyVersion => Str

Parameter used to indicate the version of the key carried in the key
block or indicate the value carried in the key block is a component of
a key.


=head2 OptionalBlocks => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::OptionalBlocks>

Parameter used to indicate the type of optional data in key block
headers. Refer to ANSI X9.143-2022
(https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ascx9/ansix91432022) for
information on allowed data type for optional blocks.

Optional block character limit is 112 characters. For each optional
block, 2 characters are reserved for optional block ID and 2 characters
reserved for optional block length. More than one optional blocks can
be included as long as the combined length does not increase 112
characters.
