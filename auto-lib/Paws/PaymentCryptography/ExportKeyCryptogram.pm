=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportKeyCryptogram

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportKeyCryptogram object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., WrappingSpec => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportKeyCryptogram object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for key material export using asymmetric RSA wrap
and unwrap key exchange method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the certificate chain that signs the wrapping key
certificate during RSA wrap and unwrap key export.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WrappingKeyCertificate => Str

The wrapping key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded). Amazon Web
Services Payment Cryptography uses this certificate to wrap the key
under export.


=head2 WrappingSpec => Str

The wrapping spec for the key under export.
