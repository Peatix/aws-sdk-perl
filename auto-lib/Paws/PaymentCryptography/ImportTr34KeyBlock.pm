=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportTr34KeyBlock

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportTr34KeyBlock object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., WrappedKeyBlock => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportTr34KeyBlock object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for key material import using the asymmetric
TR-34 key exchange method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the certificate chain that signs the signing key
certificate during TR-34 key import.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImportToken => Str

The import token that initiates key import using the asymmetric TR-34
key exchange method into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. It
expires after 7 days. You can use the same import token to import
multiple keys to the same service account.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyBlockFormat => Str

The key block format to use during key import. The only value allowed
is C<X9_TR34_2012>.


=head2 RandomNonce => Str

A random number value that is unique to the TR-34 key block generated
using 2 pass. The operation will fail, if a random nonce value is not
provided for a TR-34 key block generated using 2 pass.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SigningKeyCertificate => Str

The public key component in PEM certificate format of the private key
that signs the KDH TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WrappedKeyBlock => Str

The TR-34 wrapped key block to import.
