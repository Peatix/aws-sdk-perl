=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyAlgorithm => $value, ..., KeyUsage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyAlgorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The role of the key, the algorithm it supports, and the cryptographic
operations allowed with the key. This data is immutable after the key
is created.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAlgorithm => Str

The key algorithm to be use during creation of an Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography key.

For symmetric keys, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports
C<AES> and C<TDES> algorithms. For asymmetric keys, Amazon Web Services
Payment Cryptography supports C<RSA> and C<ECC_NIST> algorithms.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyClass => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key to create,
which determines the classication of the cryptographic method and
whether Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key contains a
symmetric key or an asymmetric key pair.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyModesOfUse => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyModesOfUse>

The list of cryptographic operations that you can perform using the
key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyUsage => Str

The cryptographic usage of an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
key as dened in section A.5.2 of the TR-31 spec.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::PaymentCryptography>
