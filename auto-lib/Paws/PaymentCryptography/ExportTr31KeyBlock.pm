=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr31KeyBlock

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr31KeyBlock object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyBlockHeaders => $value, ..., WrappingKeyIdentifier => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ExportTr31KeyBlock object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyBlockHeaders

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for key material export using symmetric TR-31 key
exchange method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KeyBlockHeaders => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyBlockHeaders>

Optional metadata for export associated with the key material. This
data is signed but transmitted in clear text.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WrappingKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<KeyARN> of the the wrapping key. This key encrypts or wraps the
key under export for TR-31 key block generation.
