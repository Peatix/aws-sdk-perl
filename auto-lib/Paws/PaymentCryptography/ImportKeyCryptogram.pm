=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportKeyCryptogram

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportKeyCryptogram object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Exportable => $value, ..., WrappingSpec => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptography::ImportKeyCryptogram object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Exportable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameter information for key material import using asymmetric RSA wrap
and unwrap key exchange method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Exportable => Bool

Specifies whether the key is exportable from the service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImportToken => Str

The import token that initiates key import using the asymmetric RSA
wrap and unwrap key exchange method into AWS Payment Cryptography. It
expires after 7 days. You can use the same import token to import
multiple keys to the same service account.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAttributes => L<Paws::PaymentCryptography::KeyAttributes>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> WrappedKeyCryptogram => Str

The RSA wrapped key cryptogram under import.


=head2 WrappingSpec => Str

The wrapping spec for the wrapped key cryptogram.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::PaymentCryptography>
