operation can't find or process a specific entity.

The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account numbers that contains the
affected entities.

A message that describes the error. Follow the error message and retry
your request.

For example, the C<InvalidAccountInputError> error message appears if

specify the C<AccountSpecific> value for the C<EventScopeCode>
parameter, but don't specify an Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 ErrorName => Str

The name of the error.


=head2 EventArn => Str

The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
C<arn:aws:health:I<event-region>::event/I<SERVICE>/I<EVENT_TYPE_CODE>/I<EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID>
> format.

For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

C<arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456>
