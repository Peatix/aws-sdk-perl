=head1 NAME

Paws::Health::OrganizationEvent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Health::OrganizationEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., StatusCode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Health::OrganizationEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary information about an event, returned by the
DescribeEventsForOrganization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventsForOrganization.html)
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The unique identifier for the event. The event ARN has the
C<arn:aws:health:I<event-region>::event/I<SERVICE>/I<EVENT_TYPE_CODE>/I<EVENT_TYPE_PLUS_ID>
> format.

For example, an event ARN might look like the following:

C<arn:aws:health:us-east-1::event/EC2/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED/EC2_INSTANCE_RETIREMENT_SCHEDULED_ABC123-DEF456>


=head2 EndTime => Str

The date and time that the event ended.


=head2 EventScopeCode => Str

This parameter specifies if the Health event is a public Amazon Web
Services service event or an account-specific event.

=over

=item *

If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<PUBLIC>, then the
C<affectedAccounts> value is always empty.

=item *

If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC>, then the
C<affectedAccounts> value lists the affected Amazon Web Services
accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a
service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web
Services accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in
the response.

=item *

If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<NONE>, then the C<eventArn> that
you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.
