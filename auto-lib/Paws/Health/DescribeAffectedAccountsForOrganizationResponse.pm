If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<PUBLIC>, then the
C<affectedAccounts> value is always empty.

=item *

If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<ACCOUNT_SPECIFIC>, then the
C<affectedAccounts> value lists the affected Amazon Web Services
accounts in your organization. For example, if an event affects a
service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and you have Amazon Web
Services accounts that use that service, those account IDs appear in
the response.

=item *

If the C<eventScopeCode> value is C<NONE>, then the C<eventArn> that
you specified in the request is invalid or doesn't exist.

returned, and a C<nextToken> pagination token is returned in the
response. To retrieve the next batch of results, reissue the search
request and include the returned token. When all results have been
returned, the response does not contain a pagination token value.
