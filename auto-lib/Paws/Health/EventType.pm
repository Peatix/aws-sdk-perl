=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Category => $value, ..., Service => $value  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the metadata about a type of event that is reported by Health.
The C<EventType> shows the category, service, and the event type code
of the event. For example, an C<issue> might be the category, C<EC2>
the service, and C<AWS_EC2_SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE_EVENT> the event type
code.

You can use the DescribeEventTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEventTypes.html)
API operation to return this information about an event.

You can also use the Amazon CloudWatch Events console to create a rule
so that you can get notified or take action when Health delivers a
specific event to your Amazon Web Services account. For more
information, see Monitor for Health events with Amazon CloudWatch
Events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/cloudwatch-events-health.html)
in the I<Health User Guide>.
