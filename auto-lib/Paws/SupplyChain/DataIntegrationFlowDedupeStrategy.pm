=head1 NAME

Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDedupeStrategy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDedupeStrategy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldPriority => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDedupeStrategy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldPriority

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The deduplication strategy details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FieldPriority => L<Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowFieldPriorityDedupeStrategyConfiguration>

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of the deduplication strategy.

=item *

B<FIELD_PRIORITY> - Field priority configuration for the deduplication
strategy specifies an ordered list of fields used to tie-break the data
records sharing the same primary key values. Fields earlier in the list
have higher priority for evaluation. For each field, the sort order
determines whether to retain data record with larger or smaller field
value.
