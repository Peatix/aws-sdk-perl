=head1 NAME

Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDatasetOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDatasetOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DedupeRecords => $value, ..., LoadType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDatasetOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DedupeRecords

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The dataset options used in dataset source and target configurations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DedupeRecords => Bool

The option to perform deduplication on data records sharing same
primary key values. If disabled, transformed data with duplicate
primary key values will ingest into dataset, for datasets within B<asc>
namespace, such duplicates will cause ingestion fail. If enabled
without dedupeStrategy, deduplication is done by retaining a random
data record among those sharing the same primary key values. If enabled
with dedupeStragtegy, the deduplication is done following the strategy.

Note that target dataset may have partition configured, when dedupe is
enabled, it only dedupe against primary keys and retain only one record
out of those duplicates regardless of its partition status.


=head2 DedupeStrategy => L<Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationFlowDedupeStrategy>

The deduplication strategy to dedupe the data records sharing same
primary key values of the target dataset. This strategy only applies to
target dataset with primary keys and with dedupeRecords option enabled.
If transformed data still got duplicates after the dedupeStrategy
evaluation, a random data record is chosen to be retained.


=head2 LoadType => Str

The target dataset's data load type. This only affects how source S3
files are selected in the S3-to-dataset flow.

=over

=item *

B<REPLACE> - Target dataset will get replaced with the new file added
under the source s3 prefix.

=item *

B<INCREMENTAL> - Target dataset will get updated with the up-to-date
content under S3 prefix incorporating any file additions or removals
there.
