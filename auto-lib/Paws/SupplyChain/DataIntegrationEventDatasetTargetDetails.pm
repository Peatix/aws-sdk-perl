=head1 NAME

Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationEventDatasetTargetDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationEventDatasetTargetDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatasetIdentifier => $value, ..., OperationType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationEventDatasetTargetDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatasetIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The target dataset details for a DATASET event type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetIdentifier => Str

The datalake dataset ARN identifier.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetLoadExecution => L<Paws::SupplyChain::DataIntegrationEventDatasetLoadExecutionDetails>

The target dataset load execution.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OperationType => Str

The target dataset load operation type. The available options are:

=over

=item *

B<APPEND> - Add new records to the dataset. Noted that this operation
type will just try to append records as-is without any primary key or
partition constraints.

=item *

B<UPSERT> - Modify existing records in the dataset with primary key
configured, events for datasets without primary keys are not allowed.
If event data contains primary keys that match records in the dataset
within same partition, then those existing records (in that partition)
will be updated. If primary keys do not match, new records will be
added. Note that if dataset contain records with duplicate primary key
values in the same partition, those duplicate records will be deduped
into one updated record.

=item *

B<DELETE> - Remove existing records in the dataset with primary key
configured, events for datasets without primary keys are not allowed.
If event data contains primary keys that match records in the dataset
within same partition, then those existing records (in that partition)
will be deleted. If primary keys do not match, no actions will be done.
Note that if dataset contain records with duplicate primary key values
in the same partition, all those duplicates will be removed.
