=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::VariableImpactExplanation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::VariableImpactExplanation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EventVariableName => $value, ..., RelativeImpact => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::VariableImpactExplanation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EventVariableName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the event variable's impact on the prediction score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EventVariableName => Str

The event variable name.


=head2 LogOddsImpact => Num

The raw, uninterpreted value represented as log-odds of the fraud.
These values are usually between -10 to +10, but range from - infinity
to + infinity.

=over

=item *

A positive value indicates that the variable drove the risk score up.

=item *

A negative value indicates that the variable drove the risk score down.

=back



=head2 RelativeImpact => Str

The event variable's relative impact in terms of magnitude on the
prediction scores. The relative impact values consist of a numerical
rating (0-5, 5 being the highest) and direction (increased/decreased)
impact of the fraud risk.
