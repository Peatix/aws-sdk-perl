=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::PredictionExplanations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::PredictionExplanations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanations => $value, ..., VariableImpactExplanations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::PredictionExplanations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The prediction explanations that provide insight into how each event
variable impacted the model version's fraud prediction score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanation>]

The details of the aggregated variables impact on the prediction score.

Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model uses event variables from the
login data you provide to continuously calculate a set of variables
(aggregated variables) based on historical events. For example, your
ATI model might calculate the number of times an user has logged in
using the same IP address. In this case, event variables used to derive
the aggregated variables are C<IP address> and C<user>.


=head2 VariableImpactExplanations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FraudDetector::VariableImpactExplanation>]

The details of the event variable's impact on the prediction score.
