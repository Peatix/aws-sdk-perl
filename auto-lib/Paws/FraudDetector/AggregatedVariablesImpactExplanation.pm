=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EventVariableNames => $value, ..., RelativeImpact => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedVariablesImpactExplanation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EventVariableNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the impact of aggregated variables on the prediction
score.

Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model uses the login data you provide
to continuously calculate a set of variables (aggregated variables)
based on historical events. For example, the model might calculate the
number of times an user has logged in using the same IP address. In
this case, event variables used to derive the aggregated variables are
C<IP address> and C<user>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EventVariableNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names of all the event variables that were used to derive the
aggregated variables.


=head2 LogOddsImpact => Num

The raw, uninterpreted value represented as log-odds of the fraud.
These values are usually between -10 to +10, but range from -infinity
to +infinity.

=over

=item *

A positive value indicates that the variables drove the risk score up.

=item *

A negative value indicates that the variables drove the risk score
down.

=back



=head2 RelativeImpact => Str

The relative impact of the aggregated variables in terms of magnitude
on the prediction scores.
