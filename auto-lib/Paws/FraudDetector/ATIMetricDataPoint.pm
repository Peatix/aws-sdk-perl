=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::ATIMetricDataPoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::ATIMetricDataPoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Adr => $value, ..., Threshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::ATIMetricDataPoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Adr

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model performance metrics data
points.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Adr => Num

The anomaly discovery rate. This metric quantifies the percentage of
anomalies that can be detected by the model at the selected score
threshold. A lower score threshold increases the percentage of
anomalies captured by the model, but would also require challenging a
larger percentage of login events, leading to a higher customer
friction.


=head2 Atodr => Num

The account takeover discovery rate. This metric quantifies the
percentage of account compromise events that can be detected by the
model at the selected score threshold. This metric is only available if
50 or more entities with at-least one labeled account takeover event is
present in the ingested dataset.


=head2 Cr => Num

The challenge rate. This indicates the percentage of login events that
the model recommends to challenge such as one-time password,
multi-factor authentication, and investigations.


=head2 Threshold => Num

The model's threshold that specifies an acceptable fraud capture rate.
For example, a threshold of 500 means any model score 500 or above is
labeled as fraud.
