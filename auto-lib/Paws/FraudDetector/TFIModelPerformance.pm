=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::TFIModelPerformance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::TFIModelPerformance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Auc => $value, ..., UncertaintyRange => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::TFIModelPerformance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Auc

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Transaction Fraud Insights (TFI) model performance score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Auc => Num

The area under the curve (auc). This summarizes the total positive rate
(tpr) and false positive rate (FPR) across all possible model score
thresholds.


=head2 UncertaintyRange => L<Paws::FraudDetector::UncertaintyRange>

Indicates the range of area under curve (auc) expected from the TFI
model. A range greater than 0.1 indicates higher model uncertainity.



=head1 SEE ALSO
