=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::ATIModelPerformance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::ATIModelPerformance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Asi => $value, ..., Asi => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::ATIModelPerformance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Asi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model performance score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Asi => Num

The anomaly separation index (ASI) score. This metric summarizes the
overall ability of the model to separate anomalous activities from the
normal behavior. Depending on the business, a large fraction of these
anomalous activities can be malicious and correspond to the account
takeover attacks. A model with no separability power will have the
lowest possible ASI score of 0.5, whereas the a model with a high
separability power will have the highest possible ASI score of 1.0
