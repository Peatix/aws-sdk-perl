=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedLogOddsMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedLogOddsMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregatedVariablesImportance => $value, ..., VariableNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::AggregatedLogOddsMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregatedVariablesImportance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The log odds metric details.

Account Takeover Insights (ATI) model uses event variables from the
login data you provide to continuously calculate a set of variables
(aggregated variables) based on historical events. For example, your
ATI model might calculate the number of times an user has logged in
using the same IP address. In this case, event variables used to derive
the aggregated variables are C<IP address> and C<user>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AggregatedVariablesImportance => Num

The relative importance of the variables in the list to the other event
variable.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VariableNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names of all the variables.
