=head1 NAME

Paws::FraudDetector::UncertaintyRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FraudDetector::UncertaintyRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LowerBoundValue => $value, ..., UpperBoundValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::UncertaintyRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LowerBoundValue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Range of area under curve (auc) expected from the model. A range
greater than 0.1 indicates higher model uncertainity. A range is the
difference between upper and lower bound of auc.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LowerBoundValue => Num

The lower bound value of the area under curve (auc).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpperBoundValue => Num

The upper bound value of the area under curve (auc).
