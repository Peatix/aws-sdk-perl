  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Fpr => $value, ..., Tpr => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FraudDetector::OFIMetricDataPoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Fpr

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Online Fraud Insights (OFI) model performance metrics data points.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Fpr => Num

The false positive rate. This is the percentage of total legitimate
events that are incorrectly predicted as fraud.


=head2 Precision => Num

The percentage of fraud events correctly predicted as fraudulent as
compared to all events predicted as fraudulent.


=head2 Threshold => Num

The model threshold that specifies an acceptable fraud capture rate.
For example, a threshold of 500 means any model score 500 or above is
