=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSageMakerNotebookInstanceDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSageMakerNotebookInstanceDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceleratorTypes => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSageMakerNotebookInstanceDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceleratorTypes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about an Amazon SageMaker AI notebook instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcceleratorTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Amazon Elastic Inference instance types to associate with the
notebook instance. Currently, only one instance type can be associated
with a notebook instance.


=head2 AdditionalCodeRepositories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of up to three Git repositories associated with the notebook
instance. These can be either the names of Git repositories stored as
resources in your account, or the URL of Git repositories in CodeCommit
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
or in any other Git repository. These repositories are cloned at the
same level as the default repository of your notebook instance. For
more information, see Associating Git repositories with SageMaker AI
notebook instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi-git-repo.html) in
the I<Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide>.


=head2 DefaultCodeRepository => Str

The Git repository associated with the notebook instance as its default
code repository. This can be either the name of a Git repository stored
as a resource in your account, or the URL of a Git repository in
CodeCommit
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
or in any other Git repository. When you open a notebook instance, it
opens in the directory that contains this repository. For more
information, see Associating Git repositories with SageMaker AI
notebook instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi-git-repo.html) in
the I<Amazon SageMaker AI Developer Guide>.


=head2 DirectInternetAccess => Str

Sets whether SageMaker AI provides internet access to the notebook
instance. If you set this to C<Disabled>, this notebook instance is
able to access resources only in your VPC, and is not be able to
connect to SageMaker AI training and endpoint services unless you
configure a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway in your VPC.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If status of the instance is C<Failed>, the reason it failed.


=head2 InstanceMetadataServiceConfiguration => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSageMakerNotebookInstanceMetadataServiceConfigurationDetails>

Information on the IMDS configuration of the notebook instance.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The type of machine learning (ML) compute instance to launch for the
notebook instance.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Key Management Service (KMS) key
that SageMaker AI uses to encrypt data on the storage volume attached
to your notebook instance. The KMS key you provide must be enabled. For
information, see Enabling and disabling keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/enabling-keys.html)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 NetworkInterfaceId => Str

The network interface ID that SageMaker AI created when the instance
was created.


=head2 NotebookInstanceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notebook instance.


=head2 NotebookInstanceLifecycleConfigName => Str

The name of a notebook instance lifecycle configuration.


=head2 NotebookInstanceName => Str

The name of the new notebook instance.


=head2 NotebookInstanceStatus => Str

The status of the notebook instance.


=head2 PlatformIdentifier => Str

The platform identifier of the notebook instance runtime environment.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with the
instance.


=head2 RootAccess => Str

Whether root access is enabled or disabled for users of the notebook
instance.


=head2 SecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The VPC security group IDs.


=head2 SubnetId => Str

The ID of the VPC subnet to which you have a connectivity from your ML
compute instance.


=head2 Url => Str

The URL that you use to connect to the Jupyter notebook that is running
in your notebook instance.


=head2 VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The size, in GB, of the ML storage volume to attach to the notebook
instance.
