=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsEbsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsEbsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteOnTermination => $value, ..., VolumeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsEbsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteOnTermination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters that are used to automatically set up EBS volumes when an
instance is launched.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteOnTermination => Bool

Whether to delete the volume when the instance is terminated.


=head2 Encrypted => Bool

Whether to encrypt the volume.


=head2 Iops => Int

The number of input/output (I/O) operations per second (IOPS) to
provision for the volume.

Only supported for C<gp3> or C<io1> volumes. Required for C<io1>
volumes. Not used with C<standard>, C<gp2>, C<st1>, or C<sc1> volumes.


=head2 SnapshotId => Str

The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

You must specify either C<VolumeSize> or C<SnapshotId>.


=head2 VolumeSize => Int

The volume size, in GiBs. The following are the supported volumes sizes
for each volume type:

=over

=item *

gp2 and gp3: 1-16,384

=item *

io1: 4-16,384

=item *

st1 and sc1: 125-16,384

=item *

standard: 1-1,024

=back

You must specify either C<SnapshotId> or C<VolumeSize>. If you specify
both C<SnapshotId> and C<VolumeSize>, the volume size must be equal or
greater than the size of the snapshot.


=head2 VolumeType => Str

The volume type. Valid values are as follows:

=over

=item *

C<gp2>

=item *

C<gp3>

=item *

C<io1>

=item *

C<sc1>

=item *

C<st1>

=item *

C<standard>

=back
