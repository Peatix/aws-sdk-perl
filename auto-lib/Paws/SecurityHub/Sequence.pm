=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::Sequence

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::Sequence object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actors => $value, ..., Uid => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::Sequence object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about an Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat
Detection attack sequence finding. GuardDuty generates an attack
sequence finding when multiple events align to a potentially suspicious
activity. To receive GuardDuty attack sequence findings in Security
Hub, you must have GuardDuty enabled. For more information, see
GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-extended-threat-detection.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::Actor>]

Provides information about the actors involved in the attack sequence.


=head2 Endpoints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkEndpoint>]

Contains information about the network endpoints that were used in the
attack sequence.


=head2 SequenceIndicators => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::Indicator>]

Contains information about the indicators observed in the attack
sequence. The values for SignalIndicators
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_Signal.html)
are a subset of the values for C<SequenceIndicators>, but the values
for these fields don't always match 1:1.


=head2 Signals => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::Signal>]

Contains information about the signals involved in the attack sequence.


=head2 Uid => Str

Unique identifier of the attack sequence.
