=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafWebAclRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafWebAclRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafWebAclRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details for a rule in an WAF web ACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => L<Paws::SecurityHub::WafAction>

Specifies the action that CloudFront or WAF takes when a web request
matches the conditions in the rule.


=head2 ExcludedRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::WafExcludedRule>]

Rules to exclude from a rule group.


=head2 OverrideAction => L<Paws::SecurityHub::WafOverrideAction>

Use the C<OverrideAction> to test your C<RuleGroup>.

Any rule in a C<RuleGroup> can potentially block a request. If you set
the C<OverrideAction> to C<None>, the C<RuleGroup> blocks a request if
any individual rule in the C<RuleGroup> matches the request and is
configured to block that request.

However, if you first want to test the C<RuleGroup>, set the
C<OverrideAction> to C<Count>. The C<RuleGroup> then overrides any
block action specified by individual rules contained within the group.
Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests are counted.

C<ActivatedRule>|C<OverrideAction> applies only when updating or adding
a C<RuleGroup> to a web ACL. In this case you don't use
C<ActivatedRule> C<Action>. For all other update requests,
C<ActivatedRule> C<Action> is used instead of C<ActivatedRule>
C<OverrideAction>.


=head2 Priority => Int

Specifies the order in which the rules in a web ACL are evaluated.
Rules with a lower value for C<Priority> are evaluated before rules
with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add
multiple rules to a web ACL, the values don't need to be consecutive.


=head2 RuleId => Str

The identifier for a rule.


=head2 Type => Str

The rule type.

Valid values: C<REGULAR> | C<RATE_BASED> | C<GROUP>

The default is C<REGULAR>.
