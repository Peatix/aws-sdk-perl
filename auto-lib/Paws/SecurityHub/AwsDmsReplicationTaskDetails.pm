=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationTaskDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationTaskDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CdcStartPosition => $value, ..., TaskData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationTaskDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CdcStartPosition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about an Database Migration Service (DMS) replication
task. A replication task moves a set of data from the source endpoint
to the target endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CdcStartPosition => Str

Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to start.
C<CCdcStartPosition> or C<CCdcStartTime> specifies when you want a CDC
operation to start. Only a value for one of these fields is included.


=head2 CdcStartTime => Str

Indicates the start time for a CDC operation. C<CdcStartPosition> or
C<CCdcStartTime> specifies when you want a CDC operation to start. Only
a value for one of these fields is included.


=head2 CdcStopPosition => Str

Indicates when you want a CDC operation to stop. The value can be
either server time or commit time.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the replication task.


=head2 MigrationType => Str

The migration type.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationTaskIdentifier => Str

The user-defined replication task identifier or name.


=head2 ReplicationTaskSettings => Str

The settings for the replication task.


=head2 ResourceIdentifier => Str

A display name for the resource identifier at the end of the
C<EndpointArn> response parameter. If you don't specify a
C<ResourceIdentifier> value, DMS generates a default identifier value
for the end of C<EndpointArn>.


=head2 SourceEndpointArn => Str

The ARN of the source endpoint.


=head2 TableMappings => Str

The table mappings for the replication task, in JSON format.


=head2 TargetEndpointArn => Str

The ARN of the target endpoint.


=head2 TaskData => Str

Supplemental information that the task requires to migrate the data for
certain source and target endpoints.
