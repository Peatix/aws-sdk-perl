=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAppSyncGraphQlApiOpenIdConnectConfigDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAppSyncGraphQlApiOpenIdConnectConfigDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthTtL => $value, ..., Issuer => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAppSyncGraphQlApiOpenIdConnectConfigDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthTtL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the authorization configuration for using an OpenID Connect
compliant service with your AppSync GraphQL API endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthTtL => Int

The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after being
authenticated.


=head2 ClientId => Str

The client identifier of the relying party at the OpenID identity
provider. This identifier is typically obtained when the relying party
is registered with the OpenID identity provider. You can specify a
regular expression so that AppSync can validate against multiple client
identifiers at a time.


=head2 IatTtL => Int

The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after it's issued to a
user.


=head2 Issuer => Str

The issuer for the OIDC configuration. The issuer returned by discovery
must exactly match the value of C<iss> in the ID token.
