=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupBackupPlanRuleDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupBackupPlanRuleDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompletionWindowMinutes => $value, ..., TargetBackupVault => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupBackupPlanRuleDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompletionWindowMinutes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about an array of C<BackupRule> objects, each of which
specifies a scheduled task that is used to back up a selection of
resources.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompletionWindowMinutes => Int

A value in minutes after a backup job is successfully started before it
must be completed, or it is canceled by Backup.


=head2 CopyActions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupBackupPlanRuleCopyActionsDetails>]

An array of C<CopyAction> objects, each of which contains details of
the copy operation.


=head2 EnableContinuousBackup => Bool

Specifies whether Backup creates continuous backups capable of
point-in-time restore (PITR).


=head2 Lifecycle => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupBackupPlanLifecycleDetails>

Defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and
when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups automatically
according to the lifecycle that you define. If you don't specify a
lifecycle, Backup applies the lifecycle policy of the source backup to
the destination backup.

Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
a minimum of 90 days.


=head2 RuleId => Str

Uniquely identifies a rule that is used to schedule the backup of a
selection of resources.


=head2 RuleName => Str

A display name for a backup rule. Must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or
'-_.' characters.


=head2 ScheduleExpression => Str

A cron expression in UTC specifying when Backup initiates a backup job.


=head2 StartWindowMinutes => Int

A value in minutes after a backup is scheduled before a job will be
canceled if it doesn't start successfully.


=head2 TargetBackupVault => Str

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults
are identified by names that are unique to the Amazon Web Services
account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where
they are created. They consist of letters, numbers, and hyphens.
