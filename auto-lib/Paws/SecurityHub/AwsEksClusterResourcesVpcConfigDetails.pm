=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEksClusterResourcesVpcConfigDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEksClusterResourcesVpcConfigDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointPublicAccess => $value, ..., SubnetIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEksClusterResourcesVpcConfigDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointPublicAccess

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the VPC configuration used by the cluster control
plane.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndpointPublicAccess => Bool

Indicates whether the Amazon EKS public API server endpoint is turned
on. If the Amazon EKS public API server endpoint is turned off, your
cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests that
originate from within the cluster VPC.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The security groups that are associated with the cross-account elastic
network interfaces that are used to allow communication between your
nodes and the Amazon EKS control plane.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The subnets that are associated with the cluster.
