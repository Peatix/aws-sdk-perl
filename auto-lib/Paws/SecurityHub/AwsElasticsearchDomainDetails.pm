=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessPolicies => $value, ..., VPCOptions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessPolicies

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an Elasticsearch domain.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessPolicies => Str

IAM policy document specifying the access policies for the new
Elasticsearch domain.


=head2 DomainEndpointOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainDomainEndpointOptions>

Additional options for the domain endpoint.


=head2 DomainId => Str

Unique identifier for an Elasticsearch domain.


=head2 DomainName => Str

Name of an Elasticsearch domain.

Domain names are unique across all domains owned by the same account
within an Amazon Web Services Region.

Domain names must start with a lowercase letter and must be between 3

=head2 ElasticsearchVersion => Str

OpenSearch version.


=head2 EncryptionAtRestOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainEncryptionAtRestOptions>

Details about the configuration for encryption at rest.


=head2 Endpoint => Str

Domain-specific endpoint used to submit index, search, and data upload
requests to an Elasticsearch domain.

The endpoint is a service URL.


=head2 Endpoints => L<Paws::SecurityHub::FieldMap>

The key-value pair that exists if the Elasticsearch domain uses VPC
endpoints.


=head2 LogPublishingOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainLogPublishingOptions>

Configures the CloudWatch Logs to publish for the Elasticsearch domain.


=head2 NodeToNodeEncryptionOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainNodeToNodeEncryptionOptions>

Details about the configuration for node-to-node encryption.


=head2 ServiceSoftwareOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainServiceSoftwareOptions>

Information about the status of a domain relative to the latest service
software.
