=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::Indicator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::Indicator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::Indicator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the indicators observed in an Amazon
GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection attack sequence. Indicators include
a set of signals, which can be API activities or findings that
GuardDuty uses to detect an attack sequence finding. GuardDuty
generates an attack sequence finding when multiple signals align to a
potentially suspicious activity. To receive GuardDuty attack sequence
findings in Security Hub, you must have GuardDuty and GuardDuty S3
Protection enabled. For more information, see GuardDuty Extended Threat
Detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-extended-threat-detection.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Key => Str

The name of the indicator thatE<rsquo>s present in the attack sequence
finding.


=head2 Title => Str

The title describing the indicator.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of indicator.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Values associated with each indicator key. For example, if the
indicator key is C<SUSPICIOUS_NETWORK>, then the value will be the name
of the network. If the indicator key is C<ATTACK_TACTIC>, then the
value will be one of the MITRE tactics.
