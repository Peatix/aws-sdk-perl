=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsOpenSearchServiceDomainClusterConfigDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsOpenSearchServiceDomainClusterConfigDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DedicatedMasterCount => $value, ..., ZoneAwarenessEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsOpenSearchServiceDomainClusterConfigDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DedicatedMasterCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about the configuration of an OpenSearch cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DedicatedMasterCount => Int

The number of instances to use for the master node. If this attribute
is specified, then C<DedicatedMasterEnabled> must be C<true>.


=head2 DedicatedMasterEnabled => Bool

Whether to use a dedicated master node for the OpenSearch domain. A
dedicated master node performs cluster management tasks, but does not
hold data or respond to data upload requests.


=head2 DedicatedMasterType => Str

The hardware configuration of the computer that hosts the dedicated
master node.

If this attribute is specified, then C<DedicatedMasterEnabled> must be
C<true>.


=head2 InstanceCount => Int

The number of data nodes to use in the OpenSearch domain.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type for your data nodes.

For a list of valid values, see Supported instance types in Amazon
OpenSearch Service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html)
in the I<Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 WarmCount => Int

The number of UltraWarm instances.


=head2 WarmEnabled => Bool

Whether UltraWarm is enabled.


=head2 WarmType => Str

The type of UltraWarm instance.


=head2 ZoneAwarenessConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsOpenSearchServiceDomainClusterConfigZoneAwarenessConfigDetails>

Configuration options for zone awareness. Provided if
C<ZoneAwarenessEnabled> is C<true>.


=head2 ZoneAwarenessEnabled => Bool

Whether to enable zone awareness for the OpenSearch domain. When zone
awareness is enabled, OpenSearch Service allocates the cluster's nodes
and replica index shards across Availability Zones (AZs) in the same
Region. This prevents data loss and minimizes downtime if a node or
data center fails.
