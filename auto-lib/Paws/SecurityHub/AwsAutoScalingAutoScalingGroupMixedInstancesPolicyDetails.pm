=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstancesDistribution => $value, ..., LaunchTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstancesDistribution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The mixed instances policy for the automatic scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstancesDistribution => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyInstancesDistributionDetails>

The instances distribution. The instances distribution specifies the
distribution of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances, the maximum
price to pay for Spot Instances, and how the Auto Scaling group
allocates instance types to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacity.


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyLaunchTemplateDetails>

The launch template to use and the instance types (overrides) to use to
provision EC2 instances to fulfill On-Demand and Spot capacities.
