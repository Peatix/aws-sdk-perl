=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeviceName => $value, ..., VirtualName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeviceName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a block device mapping for an Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (Amazon EC2) launch template.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeviceName => Str

The device name.


=head2 Ebs => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetEbsDetails>

Parameters used to automatically set up Amazon EBS volumes when the
instance is launched.


=head2 NoDevice => Str

Omits the device from the block device mapping when an empty string is
specified.


=head2 VirtualName => Str

The virtual device name (ephemeralN). Instance store volumes are
numbered starting from 0. An instance type with 2 available instance
store volumes can specify mappings for C<ephemeral0> and C<ephemeral1>.
The number of available instance store volumes depends on the instance
type.
