=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeviceName => $value, ..., VirtualName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeviceName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A block device for the instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeviceName => Str

The device name that is exposed to the EC2 instance. For example,
C</dev/sdh> or C<xvdh>.


=head2 Ebs => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsEbsDetails>

Parameters that are used to automatically set up Amazon EBS volumes
when an instance is launched.


=head2 NoDevice => Bool

Whether to suppress the device that is included in the block device
mapping of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

If C<NoDevice> is C<true>, then you cannot specify C<Ebs>.E<gt>
