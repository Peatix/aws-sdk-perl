=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2VpnConnectionOptionsTunnelOptionsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2VpnConnectionOptionsTunnelOptionsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DpdTimeoutSeconds => $value, ..., TunnelInsideCidr => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2VpnConnectionOptionsTunnelOptionsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DpdTimeoutSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The VPN tunnel options.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DpdTimeoutSeconds => Int

The number of seconds after which a Dead Peer Detection (DPD) timeout
occurs.


=head2 IkeVersions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) versions that are permitted for the VPN
tunnel.


=head2 OutsideIpAddress => Str

The external IP address of the VPN tunnel.


=head2 Phase1DhGroupNumbers => ArrayRef[Int]

The permitted Diffie-Hellman group numbers for the VPN tunnel for phase
1 IKE negotiations.


=head2 Phase1EncryptionAlgorithms => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The permitted encryption algorithms for the VPN tunnel for phase 1 IKE
negotiations.


=head2 Phase1IntegrityAlgorithms => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The permitted integrity algorithms for the VPN tunnel for phase 1 IKE
negotiations.


=head2 Phase1LifetimeSeconds => Int

The lifetime for phase 1 of the IKE negotiation, in seconds.


=head2 Phase2DhGroupNumbers => ArrayRef[Int]

The permitted Diffie-Hellman group numbers for the VPN tunnel for phase
2 IKE negotiations.


=head2 Phase2EncryptionAlgorithms => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The permitted encryption algorithms for the VPN tunnel for phase 2 IKE
negotiations.


=head2 Phase2IntegrityAlgorithms => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The permitted integrity algorithms for the VPN tunnel for phase 2 IKE
negotiations.


=head2 Phase2LifetimeSeconds => Int

The lifetime for phase 2 of the IKE negotiation, in seconds.


=head2 PreSharedKey => Str

The preshared key to establish initial authentication between the
virtual private gateway and the customer gateway.


=head2 RekeyFuzzPercentage => Int

The percentage of the rekey window, which is determined by
C<RekeyMarginTimeSeconds> during which the rekey time is randomly
selected.


=head2 RekeyMarginTimeSeconds => Int

The margin time, in seconds, before the phase 2 lifetime expires,
during which the Amazon Web Services side of the VPN connection
performs an IKE rekey.


=head2 ReplayWindowSize => Int

The number of packets in an IKE replay window.


=head2 TunnelInsideCidr => Str

The range of inside IPv4 addresses for the tunnel.
