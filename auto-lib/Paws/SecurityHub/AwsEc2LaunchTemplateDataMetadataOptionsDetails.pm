=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataMetadataOptionsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataMetadataOptionsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HttpEndpoint => $value, ..., InstanceMetadataTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataMetadataOptionsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HttpEndpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the metadata options for an Amazon EC2 instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HttpEndpoint => Str

Enables or disables the HTTP metadata endpoint on your instances. If
the parameter is not specified, the default state is enabled, and you
won't be able to access your instance metadata.


=head2 HttpProtocolIpv6 => Str

Enables or disables the IPv6 endpoint for the instance metadata
service.


=head2 HttpPutResponseHopLimit => Int

The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests.
The larger the number, the further instance metadata requests can
travel.


=head2 HttpTokens => Str

The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests.


=head2 InstanceMetadataTags => Str

When set to C<enabled>, this parameter allows access to instance tags
from the instance metadata. When set to C<disabled>, it turns off
access to instance tags from the instance metadata. For more
information, see Work with instance tags in instance metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#work-with-tags-in-IMDS)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide>.
