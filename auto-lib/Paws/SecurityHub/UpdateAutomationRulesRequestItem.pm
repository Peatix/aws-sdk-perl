=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::UpdateAutomationRulesRequestItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::UpdateAutomationRulesRequestItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actions => $value, ..., RuleStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::UpdateAutomationRulesRequestItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the parameters to update in an existing automation rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AutomationRulesAction>]

One or more actions to update finding fields if a finding matches the
conditions specified in C<Criteria>.


=head2 Criteria => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AutomationRulesFindingFilters>

A set of ASFF finding field attributes and corresponding expected
values that Security Hub uses to filter findings. If a rule is enabled
and a finding matches the conditions specified in this parameter,
Security Hub applies the rule action to the finding.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the rule.


=head2 IsTerminal => Bool

Specifies whether a rule is the last to be applied with respect to a
finding that matches the rule criteria. This is useful when a finding
matches the criteria for multiple rules, and each rule has different
actions. If a rule is terminal, Security Hub applies the rule action to
a finding that matches the rule criteria and doesn't evaluate other
rules for the finding. By default, a rule isn't terminal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the rule.


=head2 RuleName => Str

The name of the rule.


=head2 RuleOrder => Int

An integer ranging from 1 to 1000 that represents the order in which
the rule action is applied to findings. Security Hub applies rules with
lower values for this parameter first.


=head2 RuleStatus => Str

Whether the rule is active after it is created. If this parameter is
equal to C<ENABLED>, Security Hub starts applying the rule to findings
and finding updates after the rule is created. To change the value of
this parameter after creating a rule, use C<BatchUpdateAutomationRules>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateAutomationRules.html).
