=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDynamoDbTableProvisionedThroughput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDynamoDbTableProvisionedThroughput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LastDecreaseDateTime => $value, ..., WriteCapacityUnits => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDynamoDbTableProvisionedThroughput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LastDecreaseDateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the provisioned throughput for the table or for a
global secondary index.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LastDecreaseDateTime => Str

Indicates when the provisioned throughput was last decreased.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 LastIncreaseDateTime => Str

Indicates when the provisioned throughput was last increased.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 NumberOfDecreasesToday => Int

The number of times during the current UTC calendar day that the
provisioned throughput was decreased.


=head2 ReadCapacityUnits => Int

The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per second
before DynamoDB returns a C<ThrottlingException>.


=head2 WriteCapacityUnits => Int

The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB
returns a C<ThrottlingException>.
