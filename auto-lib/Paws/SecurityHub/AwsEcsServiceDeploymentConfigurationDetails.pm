=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceDeploymentConfigurationDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceDeploymentConfigurationDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeploymentCircuitBreaker => $value, ..., MinimumHealthyPercent => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceDeploymentConfigurationDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeploymentCircuitBreaker

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Optional deployment parameters for the service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeploymentCircuitBreaker => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceDeploymentConfigurationDeploymentCircuitBreakerDetails>

Determines whether a service deployment fails if a service cannot reach
a steady state.


=head2 MaximumPercent => Int

For a service that uses the rolling update (C<ECS>) deployment type,
the maximum number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the
C<RUNNING> or C<PENDING> state during a deployment, and for tasks that
use the EC2 launch type, when any container instances are in the
C<DRAINING> state. Provided as a percentage of the desired number of
tasks. The default value is 200%.

For a service that uses the blue/green (C<CODE_DEPLOY>) or C<EXTERNAL>
deployment types, and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the maximum
number of tasks in the service that remain in the C<RUNNING> state
while the container instances are in the C<DRAINING> state.

For the Fargate launch type, the maximum percent value is not used.


=head2 MinimumHealthyPercent => Int

For a service that uses the rolling update (C<ECS>) deployment type,
the minimum number of tasks in a service that must remain in the
C<RUNNING> state during a deployment, and while any container instances
are in the C<DRAINING> state if the service contains tasks using the
EC2 launch type. Expressed as a percentage of the desired number of
tasks. The default value is 100%.

For a service that uses the blue/green (C<CODE_DEPLOY>) or C<EXTERNAL>
deployment types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum
number of the tasks in the service that remain in the C<RUNNING> state
while the container instances are in the C<DRAINING> state.

For the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent value is not
used.
