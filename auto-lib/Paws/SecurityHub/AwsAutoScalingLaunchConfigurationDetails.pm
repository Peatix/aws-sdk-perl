=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociatePublicIpAddress => $value, ..., UserData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociatePublicIpAddress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about a launch configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociatePublicIpAddress => Bool

For Auto Scaling groups that run in a VPC, specifies whether to assign
a public IP address to the group's instances.


=head2 BlockDeviceMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationBlockDeviceMappingsDetails>]

Specifies the block devices for the instance.


=head2 ClassicLinkVpcId => Str

The identifier of a ClassicLink-enabled VPC that EC2-Classic instances
are linked to.


=head2 ClassicLinkVpcSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifiers of one or more security groups for the VPC that is
specified in C<ClassicLinkVPCId>.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The creation date and time for the launch configuration.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 EbsOptimized => Bool

Whether the launch configuration is optimized for Amazon EBS I/O.


=head2 IamInstanceProfile => Str

The name or the ARN of the instance profile associated with the IAM
role for the instance. The instance profile contains the IAM role.


=head2 ImageId => Str

The identifier of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is used to launch
EC2 instances.


=head2 InstanceMonitoring => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationInstanceMonitoringDetails>

Indicates the type of monitoring for instances in the group.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type for the instances.


=head2 KernelId => Str

The identifier of the kernel associated with the AMI.


=head2 KeyName => Str

The name of the key pair.


=head2 LaunchConfigurationName => Str

The name of the launch configuration.


=head2 MetadataOptions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingLaunchConfigurationMetadataOptions>

The metadata options for the instances.


=head2 PlacementTenancy => Str

The tenancy of the instance. An instance with C<dedicated> tenancy runs
on isolated, single-tenant hardware and can only be launched into a
VPC.


=head2 RamdiskId => Str

The identifier of the RAM disk associated with the AMI.


=head2 SecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The security groups to assign to the instances in the Auto Scaling
group.


=head2 SpotPrice => Str

The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot Instance that is
launched to fulfill the request.


=head2 UserData => Str

The user data to make available to the launched EC2 instances. Must be
base64-encoded text.
