=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::FindingProviderSeverity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::FindingProviderSeverity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Label => $value, ..., Original => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::FindingProviderSeverity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Label

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The severity assigned to a finding by the finding provider. This object
may include one or more of the following attributes:

=over

=item *

C<Label>

=item *

C<Normalized>

=item *

C<Original>

=item *

C<Product>

=back

If a C<BatchImportFindings>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html)
request for a new finding only provides C<Label> or only provides
C<Normalized>, Security Hub automatically populates the value of the
other field.

The C<Normalized> and C<Product> attributes are included in the
C<FindingProviderSeverity> structure to preserve the historical
information associated with the finding, even if the top-level
C<Severity> object is later modified using the C<BatchUpdateFindings>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html)
operation.

If the top-level C<Finding.Severity> object is present, but
C<Finding.FindingProviderFields> isn't present, Security Hub creates
the C<FindingProviderFields.Severity> object and copies the entire
C<Finding.Severity> object into it. This ensures that the original,
provider-supplied details are retained within the
C<FindingProviderFields.Severity> object, even if the top-level
C<Severity> object is overwritten.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Label => Str

The severity label assigned to the finding by the finding provider.


=head2 Original => Str

The finding provider's original value for the severity.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 64.
