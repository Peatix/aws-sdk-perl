Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsKinesisStreamDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., StreamEncryption => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsKinesisStreamDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about an Amazon Kinesis data stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Kinesis data stream.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the Kinesis stream. If you don't specify a name, CloudFront
generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the stream name.


=head2 RetentionPeriodHours => Int

The number of hours for the data records that are stored in shards to
remain accessible.


=head2 ShardCount => Int

The number of shards that the stream uses.


=head2 StreamEncryption => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsKinesisStreamStreamEncryptionDetails>

When specified, enables or updates server-side encryption using an KMS
key for a specified stream. Removing this property from your stack
template and updating your stack disables encryption.
