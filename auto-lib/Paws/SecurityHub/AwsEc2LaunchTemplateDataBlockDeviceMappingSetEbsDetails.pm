=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetEbsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetEbsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteOnTermination => $value, ..., VolumeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataBlockDeviceMappingSetEbsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteOnTermination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters for a block device for an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon
EBS) volume in an Amazon EC2 launch template.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteOnTermination => Bool

Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.


=head2 Encrypted => Bool

Indicates whether the EBS volume is encrypted. Encrypted volumes can
only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption. If
you're creating a volume from a snapshot, you can't specify an
encryption value.


=head2 Iops => Int

The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the symmetric Key Management Service
(KMS) customer managed key used for encryption.


=head2 SnapshotId => Str

The ID of the EBS snapshot.


=head2 Throughput => Int

The throughput to provision for a gp3 volume, with a maximum of 1,000
MiB/s.


=head2 VolumeSize => Int

The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID
or a volume size.


=head2 VolumeType => Str

The volume type.
