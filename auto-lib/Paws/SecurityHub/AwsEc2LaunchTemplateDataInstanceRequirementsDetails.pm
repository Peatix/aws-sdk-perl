=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceleratorCount => $value, ..., VCpuCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceleratorCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The attributes for the Amazon EC2 instance types.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcceleratorCount => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsAcceleratorCountDetails>

The minimum and maximum number of accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, or Amazon
Web Services Inferentia chips) on an instance.


=head2 AcceleratorManufacturers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates whether instance types must have accelerators by specific
manufacturers.


=head2 AcceleratorNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The accelerators that must be on the instance type.


=head2 AcceleratorTotalMemoryMiB => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsAcceleratorTotalMemoryMiBDetails>

The minimum and maximum amount of total accelerator memory, in MiB.


=head2 AcceleratorTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The accelerator types that must be on the instance type.


=head2 BareMetal => Str

Indicates whether bare metal instance types must be included, excluded,
or required.


=head2 BaselineEbsBandwidthMbps => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsBaselineEbsBandwidthMbpsDetails>

The minimum and maximum baseline bandwidth to Amazon EBS, in Mbps. For
more information, see Amazon EBS optimized instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide>.


=head2 BurstablePerformance => Str

Indicates whether burstable performance T instance types are included,
excluded, or required. For more information, Burstable performance
instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide>.


=head2 CpuManufacturers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The CPU manufacturers to include.


=head2 ExcludedInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The instance types to exclude.


=head2 InstanceGenerations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates whether current or previous generation instance types are
included.


=head2 LocalStorage => Str

Indicates whether instance types with instance store volumes are
included, excluded, or required. For more information, see Amazon EC2
instance store
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide>.


=head2 LocalStorageTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The type of local storage that is required.


=head2 MemoryGiBPerVCpu => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsMemoryGiBPerVCpuDetails>

The minimum and maximum amount of memory per vCPU, in GiB.


=head2 MemoryMiB => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsMemoryMiBDetails>

The minimum and maximum amount of memory, in MiB.


=head2 NetworkInterfaceCount => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsNetworkInterfaceCountDetails>

The minimum and maximum number of network interfaces.


=head2 OnDemandMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice => Int

The price protection threshold for On-Demand Instances. This is the
maximum you'll pay for an On-Demand Instance, expressed as a percentage
above the least expensive current generation M, C, or R instance type
with your specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types
with your attributes, it excludes instance types priced above your
threshold.

The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a
percentage.

A high value, such as C<999999>, turns off price protection.


=head2 RequireHibernateSupport => Bool

Indicates whether instance types must support hibernation for On-Demand
Instances.


=head2 SpotMaxPricePercentageOverLowestPrice => Int

The price protection threshold for Spot Instances. This is the maximum
you'll pay for a Spot Instance, expressed as a percentage above the
least expensive current generation M, C, or R instance type with your
specified attributes. When Amazon EC2 selects instance types with your
attributes, it excludes instance types priced above your threshold.

The parameter accepts an integer, which Amazon EC2 interprets as a
percentage.

A high value, such as C<999999>, turns off price protection.


=head2 TotalLocalStorageGB => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsTotalLocalStorageGBDetails>

The minimum and maximum amount of total local storage, in GB.


=head2 VCpuCount => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataInstanceRequirementsVCpuCountDetails>

The minimum and maximum number of vCPUs.
