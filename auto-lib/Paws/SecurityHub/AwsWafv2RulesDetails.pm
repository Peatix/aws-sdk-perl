Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafv2RulesDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafv2RulesDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., VisibilityConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafv2RulesDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about rules in a rule group. A rule identifies web
requests that you want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes
one top-level Statement that WAF uses to identify matching web
requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafv2RulesActionDetails>

The action that WAF should take on a web request when it matches the
rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level can override the rule
action setting.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the rule.


=head2 OverrideAction => Str

The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule
group evaluation.


=head2 Priority => Int

If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL, WAF evaluates each
request against the Rules in order based on the value of C<Priority>.
WAF processes rules with lower priority first. The priorities don't
need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.


=head2 VisibilityConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsWafv2VisibilityConfigDetails>

Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample
collection.



=head1 SEE ALSO
