=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BackupSizeInBytes => $value, ..., StorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BackupSizeInBytes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains detailed information about the recovery points stored in an
Backup backup vault. A backup, or recovery point, represents the
content of a resource at a specified time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BackupSizeInBytes => Int

The size, in bytes, of a backup.


=head2 BackupVaultArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup vault.


=head2 BackupVaultName => Str

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults
are identified by names that are unique to the Amazon Web Services
account used to create them and the Amazon Web Services Region where
they are created. They consist of lowercase letters, numbers, and
hyphens.


=head2 CalculatedLifecycle => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointCalculatedLifecycleDetails>

A C<CalculatedLifecycle> object containing C<DeleteAt> and
C<MoveToColdStorageAt> timestamps.


=head2 CompletionDate => Str

The date and time that a job to create a recovery point is completed,
in Unix format and UTC. The value of C<CompletionDate> is accurate to
milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday,
January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CreatedBy => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointCreatedByDetails>

Contains identifying information about the creation of a recovery
point, including the C<BackupPlanArn>, C<BackupPlanId>,
C<BackupPlanVersion>, and C<BackupRuleId> of the backup plan that is
used to create it.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format and UTC.
The value of C<CreationDate> is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 EncryptionKeyArn => Str

The ARN for the server-side encryption key that is used to protect your
backups.


=head2 IamRoleArn => Str

Specifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point


=head2 IsEncrypted => Bool

A Boolean value that is returned as C<TRUE> if the specified recovery
point is encrypted, or C<FALSE> if the recovery point is not encrypted.


=head2 LastRestoreTime => Str

The date and time that a recovery point was last restored, in Unix
format and UTC. The value of C<LastRestoreTime> is accurate to
milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday,
January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 Lifecycle => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsBackupRecoveryPointLifecycleDetails>

The lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold
storage and when it expires. Backup transitions and expires backups
automatically according to the lifecycle that you define


=head2 RecoveryPointArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies a resource. The format of the ARN
depends on the resource type.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource saved as a recovery point,
such as an Amazon EBS volume or an Amazon RDS database.


=head2 SourceBackupVaultArn => Str

The ARN for the backup vault where the recovery point was originally
copied from. If the recovery point is restored to the same account,
this value will be null.


=head2 Status => Str

A status code specifying the state of the recovery point. Valid values
are as follows:

=over

=item *

C<COMPLETED>

=item *

C<DELETING>

=item *

C<EXPIRED>

=item *

C<PARTIAL>

=back



=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A message explaining the reason of the recovery point deletion failure.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

Specifies the storage class of the recovery point. Valid values are as
follows:

=over

=item *

C<COLD>

=item *

C<DELETED>

=item *

C<WARM>

=back
