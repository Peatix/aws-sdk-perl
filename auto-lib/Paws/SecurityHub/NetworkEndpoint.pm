=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkEndpoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkEndpoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutonomousSystem => $value, ..., Port => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkEndpoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutonomousSystem

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about network endpoints involved in an Amazon
GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection attack sequence. GuardDuty
generates an attack sequence finding when multiple events align to a
potentially suspicious activity. To receive GuardDuty attack sequence
findings in Security Hub, you must have GuardDuty enabled. For more
information, see GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-extended-threat-detection.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

This field can provide information about the network endpoints
associated with the resource in the attack sequence finding, or about a
specific network endpoint used for the attack.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutonomousSystem => L<Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkAutonomousSystem>

The Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the network endpoint.


=head2 Connection => L<Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkConnection>

Information about the network connection.


=head2 Domain => Str

The domain information for the network endpoint.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the network endpoint involved in the attack sequence.


=head2 Ip => Str

The IP address used in the network endpoint.


=head2 Location => L<Paws::SecurityHub::NetworkGeoLocation>

Information about the location of the network endpoint.


=head2 Port => Int

The port number associated with the network endpoint.
