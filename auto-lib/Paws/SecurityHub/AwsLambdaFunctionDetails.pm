=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Architectures => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Architectures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about an Lambda function's configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Architectures => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The instruction set architecture that the function uses. Valid values
are C<x86_64> or C<arm64>.


=head2 Code => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionCode>

An C<AwsLambdaFunctionCode> object.


=head2 CodeSha256 => Str

The SHA256 hash of the function's deployment package.


=head2 DeadLetterConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionDeadLetterConfig>

The function's dead letter queue.


=head2 Environment => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionEnvironment>

The function's environment variables.


=head2 FunctionName => Str

The name of the function.


=head2 Handler => Str

The function that Lambda calls to begin executing your function.


=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The KMS key that is used to encrypt the function's environment
variables. This key is only returned if you've configured a customer
managed customer managed key.


=head2 LastModified => Str

Indicates when the function was last updated.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 Layers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionLayer>]

The function's layers.


=head2 MasterArn => Str

For Lambda@Edge functions, the ARN of the master function.


=head2 MemorySize => Int

The memory that is allocated to the function.


=head2 PackageType => Str

The type of deployment package that's used to deploy the function code
to Lambda. Set to C<Image> for a container image and C<Zip> for a .zip
file archive.


=head2 RevisionId => Str

The latest updated revision of the function or alias.


=head2 Role => Str

The function's execution role.


=head2 Runtime => Str

The runtime environment for the Lambda function.


=head2 Timeout => Int

The amount of time that Lambda allows a function to run before stopping
it.


=head2 TracingConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionTracingConfig>

The function's X-Ray tracing configuration.


=head2 Version => Str

The version of the Lambda function.


=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsLambdaFunctionVpcConfig>

The function's networking configuration.
