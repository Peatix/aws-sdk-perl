=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFrontDistributionViewerCertificate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFrontDistributionViewerCertificate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcmCertificateArn => $value, ..., SslSupportMethod => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFrontDistributionViewerCertificate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcmCertificateArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the TLS/SSL configuration that the
CloudFront distribution uses to communicate with viewers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcmCertificateArn => Str

The ARN of the ACM certificate. Used if the certificate is stored in
ACM. If you provide an ACM certificate ARN, you must also provide
C<MinimumCertificateVersion> and C<SslSupportMethod>.


=head2 Certificate => Str

The identifier of the certificate. Note that in CloudFront, this
attribute is deprecated.


=head2 CertificateSource => Str

The source of the certificate identified by C<Certificate>. Note that
in CloudFront, this attribute is deprecated.


=head2 CloudFrontDefaultCertificate => Bool

Whether the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name. If set to
C<false>, then you provide either C<AcmCertificateArn> or
C<IamCertificateId>.


=head2 IamCertificateId => Str

The identifier of the IAM certificate. Used if the certificate is
stored in IAM. If you provide C<IamCertificateId>, then you also must
provide C<MinimumProtocolVersion> and C<SslSupportMethod>.


=head2 MinimumProtocolVersion => Str

The security policy that CloudFront uses for HTTPS connections with
viewers. If C<SslSupportMethod> is C<sni-only>, then
C<MinimumProtocolVersion> must be C<TLSv1> or higher.


=head2 SslSupportMethod => Str

The viewers that the distribution accepts HTTPS connections from.
