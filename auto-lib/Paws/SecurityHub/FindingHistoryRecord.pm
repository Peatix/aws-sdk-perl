=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::FindingHistoryRecord

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::FindingHistoryRecord object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FindingCreated => $value, ..., UpdateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::FindingHistoryRecord object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FindingCreated

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of events that changed the specified finding during the
specified time period. Each record represents a single finding change
event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FindingCreated => Bool

Identifies whether the event marks the creation of a new finding. A
value of C<True> means that the finding is newly created. A value of
C<False> means that the finding isnE<rsquo>t newly created.


=head2 FindingIdentifier => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFindingIdentifier>




=head2 NextToken => Str

A token for pagination purposes. Provide this token in the subsequent
request to C<GetFindingsHistory>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_GetFindingsHistory.html)
to get up to an additional 100 results of history for the same finding
that you specified in your initial request.


=head2 Updates => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::FindingHistoryUpdate>]

An array of objects that provides details about the finding change
event, including the Amazon Web Services Security Finding Format (ASFF)
field that changed, the value of the field before the change, and the
value of the field after the change.


=head2 UpdateSource => L<Paws::SecurityHub::FindingHistoryUpdateSource>

Identifies the source of the event that changed the finding. For
example, an integrated Amazon Web Services service or third-party
partner integration may call C<BatchImportFindings>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchImportFindings.html),
or an Security Hub customer may call C<BatchUpdateFindings>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateFindings.html).


=head2 UpdateTime => Str

A timestamp that indicates when Security Hub processed the updated
finding record.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).
