=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::RuleGroupSourceStatefulRulesHeaderDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::RuleGroupSourceStatefulRulesHeaderDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., SourcePort => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::RuleGroupSourceStatefulRulesHeaderDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The inspection criteria for a stateful rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => Str

The destination IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR
notation. To match with any address, specify C<ANY>.


=head2 DestinationPort => Str

The destination port to inspect for. You can specify an individual
port, such as C<1994>. You also can specify a port range, such as
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.


=head2 Direction => Str

The direction of traffic flow to inspect. If set to C<ANY>, the
inspection matches bidirectional traffic, both from the source to the
destination and from the destination to the source. If set to
C<FORWARD>, the inspection only matches traffic going from the source
to the destination.


=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocol to inspect for. To inspector for all protocols, use C<IP>.


=head2 Source => Str

The source IP address or address range to inspect for, in CIDR
notation. To match with any address, specify C<ANY>.


=head2 SourcePort => Str

The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port,
such as C<1994>. You also can specify a port range, such as
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.
