=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControl

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControl object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., UpdateStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControl object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A security control in Security Hub describes a security best practice
related to a specific resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

The description of a security control across standards. This typically
summarizes how Security Hub evaluates the control and the conditions
under which it produces a failed finding. This parameter doesn't
reference a specific standard.


=head2 LastUpdateReason => Str

The most recent reason for updating the customizable properties of a
security control. This differs from the C<UpdateReason> field of the
C<BatchUpdateStandardsControlAssociations>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_BatchUpdateStandardsControlAssociations.html)
API, which tracks the reason for updating the enablement status of a
control. This field accepts alphanumeric characters in addition to
white spaces, dashes, and underscores.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::SecurityHub::Parameters>

An object that identifies the name of a control parameter, its current
value, and whether it has been customized.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RemediationUrl => Str

A link to Security Hub documentation that explains how to remediate a
failed finding for a security control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityControlArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a security control across standards,
such as
C<arn:aws:securityhub:eu-central-1:123456789012:security-control/S3.1>.
This parameter doesn't mention a specific standard.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityControlId => Str

The unique identifier of a security control across standards. Values
for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Services service name
and a number, such as APIGateway.3.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityControlStatus => Str

The enablement status of a security control in a specific standard.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SeverityRating => Str

The severity of a security control. For more information about how
Security Hub determines control severity, see Assigning severity to
control findings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/controls-findings-create-update.html#control-findings-severity)
in the I<Security Hub User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Title => Str

The title of a security control.


=head2 UpdateStatus => Str

Identifies whether customizable properties of a security control are
reflected in Security Hub findings. A status of C<READY> indicates that
Security Hub uses the current control parameter values when running
security checks of the control. A status of C<UPDATING> indicates that
all security checks might not use the current parameter values.
