=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControlDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControlDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CurrentRegionAvailability => $value, ..., Title => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityControlDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CurrentRegionAvailability

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides metadata for a security control, including its unique
standard-agnostic identifier, title, description, severity,
availability in Amazon Web Services Regions, and a link to remediation
steps.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CurrentRegionAvailability => Str

Specifies whether a security control is available in the current Amazon
Web Services Region.


=head2 CustomizableProperties => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Security control properties that you can customize. Currently, only
parameter customization is supported for select controls. An empty
array is returned for controls that donE<rsquo>t support custom
properties.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

The description of a security control across standards. This typically
summarizes how Security Hub evaluates the control and the conditions
under which it produces a failed finding. This parameter doesn't
reference a specific standard.


=head2 ParameterDefinitions => L<Paws::SecurityHub::ParameterDefinitions>

An object that provides a security control parameter name, description,
and the options for customizing it. This object is excluded for a
control that doesn't support custom parameters.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RemediationUrl => Str

A link to Security Hub documentation that explains how to remediate a
failed finding for a security control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityControlId => Str

The unique identifier of a security control across standards. Values
for this field typically consist of an Amazon Web Services service name
and a number (for example, APIGateway.3). This parameter differs from
C<SecurityControlArn>, which is a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
assigned to a control. The ARN references the security control ID (for
example,
arn:aws:securityhub:eu-central-1:123456789012:security-control/APIGateway.3).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SeverityRating => Str

The severity of a security control. For more information about how
Security Hub determines control severity, see Assigning severity to
control findings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/controls-findings-create-update.html#control-findings-severity)
in the I<Security Hub User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Title => Str

The title of a security control.
