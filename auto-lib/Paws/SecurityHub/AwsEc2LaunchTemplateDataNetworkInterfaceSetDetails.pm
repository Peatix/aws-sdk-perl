=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociateCarrierIpAddress => $value, ..., SubnetId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociateCarrierIpAddress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One or more network interfaces to attach to an Amazon EC2 instance. If
you specify a network interface, you must specify security groups and
subnets as part of the network interface.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociateCarrierIpAddress => Bool

Indicates whether to associate a Carrier IP address with eth0 for a new
network interface. You use this option when you launch an instance in a
Wavelength Zone and want to associate a Carrier IP address with the
network interface. For more information, see Carrier IP address
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wavelength/latest/developerguide/how-wavelengths-work.html#provider-owned-ip)
in the I<Wavelength Developer Guide>.


=head2 AssociatePublicIpAddress => Bool

Associates a public IPv4 address with eth0 for a new network interface.


=head2 DeleteOnTermination => Bool

Indicates whether the network interface is deleted when the instance is
terminated.


=head2 Description => Str

A description for the network interface.


=head2 DeviceIndex => Int

The device index for the network interface attachment.


=head2 Groups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of one or more security groups.


=head2 InterfaceType => Str

The type of network interface.


=head2 Ipv4PrefixCount => Int

The number of IPv4 prefixes to be automatically assigned to the network
interface. You cannot use this option if you use the C<Ipv4Prefixes>
option.


=head2 Ipv4Prefixes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetIpv4PrefixesDetails>]

One or more IPv4 prefixes to be assigned to the network interface. You
cannot use this option if you use the C<Ipv4PrefixCount> option.


=head2 Ipv6AddressCount => Int

The number of IPv6 addresses to assign to a network interface. Amazon
EC2 automatically selects the IPv6 addresses from the subnet range. You
can't use this option if you use C<Ipv6Addresses>.


=head2 Ipv6Addresses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetIpv6AddressesDetails>]

One or more specific IPv6 addresses from the IPv6 CIDR block range of
your subnet. You can't use this option if you use C<Ipv6AddressCount>.


=head2 Ipv6PrefixCount => Int

The number of IPv6 prefixes to be automatically assigned to the network
interface. You cannot use this option if you use the C<Ipv6Prefix>
option.


=head2 Ipv6Prefixes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetIpv6PrefixesDetails>]

One or more IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to the network interface. You
cannot use this option if you use the C<Ipv6PrefixCount> option.


=head2 NetworkCardIndex => Int

The index of the network card. Some instance types support multiple
network cards. The primary network interface must be assigned to
network card index C<0>. The default is network card index C<0>.


=head2 NetworkInterfaceId => Str

The ID of the network interface.


=head2 PrivateIpAddress => Str

The primary private IPv4 address of the network interface.


=head2 PrivateIpAddresses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2LaunchTemplateDataNetworkInterfaceSetPrivateIpAddressesDetails>]

One or more private IPv4 addresses.


=head2 SecondaryPrivateIpAddressCount => Int

The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses to assign to a network
interface.


=head2 SubnetId => Str

The ID of the subnet for the network interface.
