=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsS3BucketServerSideEncryptionByDefault

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsS3BucketServerSideEncryptionByDefault object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KMSMasterKeyID => $value, ..., SSEAlgorithm => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsS3BucketServerSideEncryptionByDefault object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KMSMasterKeyID

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the default server-side encryption to apply to new objects in
the bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KMSMasterKeyID => Str

KMS key ID to use for the default encryption.


=head2 SSEAlgorithm => Str

Server-side encryption algorithm to use for the default encryption.
Valid values are C<aws: kms> or C<AES256>.
