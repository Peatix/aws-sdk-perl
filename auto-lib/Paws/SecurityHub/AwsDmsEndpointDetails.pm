=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsEndpointDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsEndpointDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateArn => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsEndpointDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about an Database Migration Service (DMS) endpoint. An
endpoint provides connection, data store type, and location information
about your data store.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the SSL certificate that encrypts
connections between the DMS endpoint and the replication instance.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

The name of the endpoint database.


=head2 EndpointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint.


=head2 EndpointIdentifier => Str

The database endpoint identifier.


=head2 EndpointType => Str

The type of endpoint. Valid values are source and target.


=head2 EngineName => Str

The type of engine for the endpoint, depending on the C<EndpointType>
value.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

A value that can be used for cross-account validation.


=head2 ExtraConnectionAttributes => Str

Additional attributes associated with the connection.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An DMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the connection parameters
for the endpoint. If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId>
parameter, then DMS uses your default encryption key. KMS creates the
default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default encryption key for
each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 Port => Int

The port used to access the endpoint.


=head2 ServerName => Str

The name of the server where the endpoint database resides.


=head2 SslMode => Str

The SSL mode used to connect to the endpoint. The default is none.


=head2 Username => Str

The user name to be used to log in to the endpoint database.
