Paws::SecurityHub::OrganizationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::OrganizationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConfigurationType => $value, ..., StatusMessage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::OrganizationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConfigurationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the way an organization is configured in
Security Hub.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConfigurationType => Str

Indicates whether the organization uses local or central configuration.

If you use local configuration, the Security Hub delegated
administrator can set C<AutoEnable> to C<true> and
C<AutoEnableStandards> to C<DEFAULT>. This automatically enables
Security Hub and default security standards in new organization
accounts. These new account settings must be set separately in each
Amazon Web Services Region, and settings may be different in each
Region.

If you use central configuration, the delegated administrator can
create configuration policies. Configuration policies can be used to
configure Security Hub, security standards, and security controls in
multiple accounts and Regions. If you want new organization accounts to
use a specific configuration, you can create a configuration policy and
associate it with the root or specific organizational units (OUs). New
accounts will inherit the policy from the root or their assigned OU.


=head2 Status => Str

Describes whether central configuration could be enabled as the
C<ConfigurationType> for the organization. If your C<ConfigurationType>
is local configuration, then the value of C<Status> is always
C<ENABLED>.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

Provides an explanation if the value of C<Status> is equal to C<FAILED>
when C<ConfigurationType> is equal to C<CENTRAL>.
