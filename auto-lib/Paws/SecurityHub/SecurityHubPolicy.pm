=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityHubPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityHubPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnabledStandardIdentifiers => $value, ..., ServiceEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::SecurityHubPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnabledStandardIdentifiers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that defines how Security Hub is configured. The
configuration policy includes whether Security Hub is enabled or
disabled, a list of enabled security standards, a list of enabled or
disabled security controls, and a list of custom parameter values for
specified controls. If you provide a list of security controls that are
enabled in the configuration policy, Security Hub disables all other
controls (including newly released controls). If you provide a list of
security controls that are disabled in the configuration policy,
Security Hub enables all other controls (including newly released
controls).
