=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyInstancesDistributionDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyInstancesDistributionDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OnDemandAllocationStrategy => $value, ..., SpotMaxPrice => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsAutoScalingAutoScalingGroupMixedInstancesPolicyInstancesDistributionDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OnDemandAllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the instances distribution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OnDemandAllocationStrategy => Str

How to allocate instance types to fulfill On-Demand capacity. The valid
value is C<prioritized>.


=head2 OnDemandBaseCapacity => Int

The minimum amount of the Auto Scaling group's capacity that must be
fulfilled by On-Demand Instances.


=head2 OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity => Int

The percentage of On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances for additional
capacity beyond C<OnDemandBaseCapacity>.


=head2 SpotAllocationStrategy => Str

How to allocate instances across Spot Instance pools. Valid values are
as follows:

=over

=item *

C<lowest-price>

=item *

C<capacity-optimized>

=item *

C<capacity-optimized-prioritized>

=back



=head2 SpotInstancePools => Int

The number of Spot Instance pools across which to allocate your Spot
Instances.


=head2 SpotMaxPrice => Str

The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot
Instance.
