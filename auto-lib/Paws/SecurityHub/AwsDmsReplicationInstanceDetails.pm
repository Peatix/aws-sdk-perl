=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationInstanceDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationInstanceDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationInstanceDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides details about an Database Migration Service (DMS) replication
instance. DMS uses a replication instance to connect to your source
data store, read the source data, and format the data for consumption
by the target data store.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The amount of storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for the
replication instance.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

Indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied automatically to
the replication instance during the maintenance window.


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone that the replication instance is created in. The
default value is a random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the
endpoint's Amazon Web Services Region, such as C<us-east-1d>.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The engine version number of the replication instance. If an engine
version number is not specified when a replication instance is created,
the default is the latest engine version available.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the
replication instance. If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId>
parameter, DMS uses your default encryption key. KMS creates the
default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your
Amazon Web Services account has a different default encryption key for
each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 MultiAZ => Bool

Specifies whether the replication instance is deployed across multiple
Availability Zones (AZs). You can't set the C<AvailabilityZone>
parameter if the C<MultiAZ> parameter is set to C<true>.


=head2 PreferredMaintenanceWindow => Str

The maintenance window times for the replication instance. Upgrades to
the replication instance are performed during this time.


=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance. A
value of C<true> represents an instance with a public IP address. A
value of C<false> represents an instance with a private IP address. The
default value is C<true>.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceClass => Str

The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as defined
for the specified replication instance class.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceIdentifier => Str

The replication instance identifier.


=head2 ReplicationSubnetGroup => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationInstanceReplicationSubnetGroupDetails>

The subnet group for the replication instance.


=head2 VpcSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsDmsReplicationInstanceVpcSecurityGroupsDetails>]

The virtual private cloud (VPC) security group for the replication
instance.



=head1 SEE ALSO
