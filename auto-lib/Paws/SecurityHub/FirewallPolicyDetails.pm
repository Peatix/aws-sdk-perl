=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { StatefulRuleGroupReferences => $value, ..., StatelessRuleGroupReferences => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->StatefulRuleGroupReferences

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the behavior of the firewall.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 StatefulRuleGroupReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyStatefulRuleGroupReferencesDetails>]

The stateful rule groups that are used in the firewall policy.


=head2 StatelessCustomActions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyStatelessCustomActionsDetails>]

The custom action definitions that are available to use in the firewall
policy's C<StatelessDefaultActions> setting.


=head2 StatelessDefaultActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to take on a packet if it doesn't match any of the
stateless rules in the policy.

You must specify a standard action (C<aws:pass>, C<aws:drop>,
C<aws:forward_to_sfe>), and can optionally include a custom action from
C<StatelessCustomActions>.


=head2 StatelessFragmentDefaultActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to take on a fragmented UDP packet if it doesn't match any
of the stateless rules in the policy.

You must specify a standard action (C<aws:pass>, C<aws:drop>,
C<aws:forward_to_sfe>), and can optionally include a custom action from
C<StatelessCustomActions>.


=head2 StatelessRuleGroupReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::FirewallPolicyStatelessRuleGroupReferencesDetails>]

The stateless rule groups that are used in the firewall policy.
