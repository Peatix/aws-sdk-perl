=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainElasticsearchClusterConfigDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainElasticsearchClusterConfigDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DedicatedMasterCount => $value, ..., ZoneAwarenessEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainElasticsearchClusterConfigDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DedicatedMasterCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

details about the configuration of an OpenSearch cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DedicatedMasterCount => Int

The number of instances to use for the master node. If this attribute
is specified, then C<DedicatedMasterEnabled> must be C<true>.


=head2 DedicatedMasterEnabled => Bool

Whether to use a dedicated master node for the Elasticsearch domain. A
dedicated master node performs cluster management tasks, but doesn't
hold data or respond to data upload requests.


=head2 DedicatedMasterType => Str

The hardware configuration of the computer that hosts the dedicated
master node. A sample value is C<m3.medium.elasticsearch>. If this
attribute is specified, then C<DedicatedMasterEnabled> must be C<true>.

For a list of valid values, see Supported instance types in Amazon
OpenSearch Service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html)
in the I<Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 InstanceCount => Int

The number of data nodes to use in the Elasticsearch domain.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type for your data nodes. For example,
C<m3.medium.elasticsearch>.

For a list of valid values, see Supported instance types in Amazon
OpenSearch Service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/supported-instance-types.html)
in the I<Amazon OpenSearch Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 ZoneAwarenessConfig => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsElasticsearchDomainElasticsearchClusterConfigZoneAwarenessConfigDetails>

Configuration options for zone awareness. Provided if
C<ZoneAwarenessEnabled> is C<true>.


=head2 ZoneAwarenessEnabled => Bool

Whether to enable zone awareness for the Elasticsearch domain. When
zone awareness is enabled, OpenSearch allocates the cluster's nodes and
replica index shards across Availability Zones in the same Region. This
prevents data loss and minimizes downtime if a node or data center
fails.
