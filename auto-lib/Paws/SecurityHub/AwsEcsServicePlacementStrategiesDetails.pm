=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServicePlacementStrategiesDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServicePlacementStrategiesDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Field => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServicePlacementStrategiesDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A placement strategy that determines how to place the tasks for the
service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Field => Str

The field to apply the placement strategy against.

For the C<spread> placement strategy, valid values are C<instanceId>
(or C<host>, which has the same effect), or any platform or custom
attribute that is applied to a container instance, such as
C<attribute:ecs.availability-zone>.

For the C<binpack> placement strategy, valid values are C<cpu> and
C<memory>.

For the C<random> placement strategy, this attribute is not used.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of placement strategy.

The C<random> placement strategy randomly places tasks on available
candidates.

The C<spread> placement strategy spreads placement across available
candidates evenly based on the value of C<Field>.

The C<binpack> strategy places tasks on available candidates that have
the least available amount of the resource that is specified in
C<Field>.

Valid values: C<random> | C<spread> | C<binpack>
