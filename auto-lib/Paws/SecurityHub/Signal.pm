=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::Signal

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::Signal object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActorIds => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::Signal object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActorIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the signals involved in an Amazon GuardDuty
Extended Threat Detection attack sequence. An attack sequence is a type
of threat detected by GuardDuty. GuardDuty generates an attack sequence
finding when multiple events, or signals, align to a potentially
suspicious activity. When GuardDuty and Security Hub are integrated,
GuardDuty sends attack sequence findings to Security Hub.

A signal can be an API activity or a finding that GuardDuty uses to
detect an attack sequence finding.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActorIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the threat actors involved in the signal.


=head2 Count => Int

The number of times this signal was observed.


=head2 CreatedAt => Int

The timestamp when the first finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 EndpointIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Information about the endpoint IDs associated with this signal.


=head2 FirstSeenAt => Int

The timestamp when the first finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the signal.


=head2 LastSeenAt => Int

The timestamp when the last finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the GuardDuty signal. For example, when signal type is
C<FINDING>, the signal name is the name of the finding.


=head2 ProductArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the product that generated the
signal.


=head2 ResourceIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The ARN or ID of the Amazon Web Services resource associated with the
signal.


=head2 Severity => Num

The severity associated with the signal. For more information about
severity, see Severity levels for GuardDuty findings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings-severity.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.


=head2 SignalIndicators => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::Indicator>]

Contains information about the indicators associated with the signals
in this attack sequence finding. The values for C<SignalIndicators> are
a subset of the values for SequenceIndicators
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/API_Sequence.html),
but the values for these fields don't always match 1:1.


=head2 Title => Str

The description of the GuardDuty finding.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of the signal used to identify an attack sequence.

Signals can be GuardDuty findings or activities observed in data
sources that GuardDuty monitors. For more information, see GuardDuty
foundational data sources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

A signal type can be one of the following values. Here are the related
descriptions:

=over

=item *

C<FINDING> - Individually generated GuardDuty finding.

=item *

C<CLOUD_TRAIL> - Activity observed from CloudTrail logs

=item *

C<S3_DATA_EVENTS> - Activity observed from CloudTrail data events for
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). Activities associated with this
type will show up only when you have enabled GuardDuty S3 Protection
feature in your account. For more information about S3 Protection and
the steps to enable it, see S3 Protection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3-protection.html) in
the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

=back



=head2 UpdatedAt => Int

The timestamp when this signal was last observed.
