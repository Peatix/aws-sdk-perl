=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFormationStackDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFormationStackDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Capabilities => $value, ..., TimeoutInMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFormationStackDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Capabilities

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Nests a stack as a resource in a top-level template. Nested stacks are
stacks created as resources for another stack.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Capabilities => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The capabilities allowed in the stack.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The time at which the stack was created.


=head2 Description => Str

A user-defined description associated with the stack.


=head2 DisableRollback => Bool

Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures.


=head2 DriftInformation => L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFormationStackDriftInformationDetails>

Information about whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or
has drifted, from its expected configuration, as defined in the stack
template and any values specified as template parameters.


=head2 EnableTerminationProtection => Bool

Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The time the nested stack was last updated. This field will only be
returned if the stack has been updated at least once.


=head2 NotificationArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Amazon SNS topic to which
stack-related events are published.


=head2 Outputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::AwsCloudFormationStackOutputsDetails>]

A list of output structures.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

The ARN of an IAM role that's associated with the stack.


=head2 StackId => Str

Unique identifier of the stack.


=head2 StackName => Str

The name associated with the stack.


=head2 StackStatus => Str

Current status of the stack.


=head2 StackStatusReason => Str

Success or failure message associated with the stack status.


=head2 TimeoutInMinutes => Int

The length of time, in minutes, that CloudFormation waits for the
nested stack to reach the C<CREATE_COMPLETE> state.
