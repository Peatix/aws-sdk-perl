=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFinding

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFinding object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., WorkflowState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFinding object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a consistent format for Security Hub findings.
C<AwsSecurityFinding> format allows you to share findings between
Amazon Web Services security services and third-party solutions.

A finding is a potential security issue generated either by Amazon Web
Services services or by the integrated third-party solutions and
standards checks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => L<Paws::SecurityHub::Action>

Provides details about an action that affects or that was taken on a
resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AwsAccountId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID that a finding is generated in.

Length Constraints: 12.


=head2 AwsAccountName => Str

The name of the Amazon Web Services account from which a finding was
generated.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 50.


=head2 CompanyName => Str

The name of the company for the product that generated the finding.

Security Hub populates this attribute automatically for each finding.
You cannot update this attribute with C<BatchImportFindings> or
C<BatchUpdateFindings>. The exception to this is a custom integration.

When you use the Security Hub console or API to filter findings by
company name, you use this attribute.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.


=head2 Compliance => L<Paws::SecurityHub::Compliance>

This data type is exclusive to findings that are generated as the
result of a check run against a specific rule in a supported security
standard, such as CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains
security standard-related finding details.


=head2 Confidence => Int

A finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood that a
finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue that it was
intended to identify.

Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0
means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

Indicates when the security findings provider created the potential
security issue that a finding captured.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 Criticality => Int

The level of importance assigned to the resources associated with the
finding.

A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criticality,
and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A finding's description. C<Description> is a required property.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 1024.


=head2 Detection => L<Paws::SecurityHub::Detection>

Provides details about an Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection
attack sequence. GuardDuty generates an attack sequence finding when
multiple events align to a potentially suspicious activity. To receive
GuardDuty attack sequence findings in Security Hub, you must have
GuardDuty enabled. For more information, see GuardDuty Extended Threat
Detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty-extended-threat-detection.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.


=head2 FindingProviderFields => L<Paws::SecurityHub::FindingProviderFields>

In a C<BatchImportFindings> request, finding providers use
C<FindingProviderFields> to provide and update their own values for
confidence, criticality, related findings, severity, and types.


=head2 FirstObservedAt => Str

Indicates when the security findings provider first observed the
potential security issue that a finding captured.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).


=head2 GeneratorDetails => L<Paws::SecurityHub::GeneratorDetails>

Provides metadata for the Amazon CodeGuru detector associated with a
finding. This field pertains to findings that relate to Lambda
functions. Amazon Inspector identifies policy violations and
vulnerabilities in Lambda function code based on internal detectors
developed in collaboration with Amazon CodeGuru. Security Hub receives
those findings.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GeneratorId => Str

The identifier for the solution-specific component (a discrete unit of
logic) that generated a finding. In various security findings
providers' solutions, this generator can be called a rule, a check, a
detector, a plugin, or something else.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The security findings provider-specific identifier for a finding.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 512.


=head2 LastObservedAt => Str

Indicates when the security findings provider most recently observed a
change in the resource that is involved in the finding.

For more information about the validation and formatting of timestamp
fields in Security Hub, see Timestamps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/1.0/APIReference/Welcome.html#timestamps).
