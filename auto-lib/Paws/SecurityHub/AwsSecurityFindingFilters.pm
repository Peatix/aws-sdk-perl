=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFindingFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFindingFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwsAccountId => $value, ..., WorkflowStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsSecurityFindingFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwsAccountId

affected software packages. You can filter findings by this field only
if you use Security Hub and Amazon Inspector.


=head2 WorkflowState => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::StringFilter>]

The workflow state of a finding.

Note that this field is deprecated. To search for a finding based on
its workflow status, use C<WorkflowStatus>.


=head2 WorkflowStatus => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecurityHub::StringFilter>]

The status of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values are the
following.

=over

=item *

C<NEW> - The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed.

Security Hub also resets the workflow status from C<NOTIFIED> or
C<RESOLVED> to C<NEW> in the following cases:

=over

=item *

C<RecordState> changes from C<ARCHIVED> to C<ACTIVE>.

=item *

C<Compliance.Status> changes from C<PASSED> to either C<WARNING>,
C<FAILED>, or C<NOT_AVAILABLE>.

=back

=item *

C<NOTIFIED> - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified about
the security issue. Used when the initial reviewer is not the resource
owner, and needs intervention from the resource owner.

If one of the following occurs, the workflow status is changed
automatically from C<NOTIFIED> to C<NEW>:

=over

=item *

C<RecordState> changes from C<ARCHIVED> to C<ACTIVE>.

=item *

C<Compliance.Status> changes from C<PASSED> to C<FAILED>, C<WARNING>,
or C<NOT_AVAILABLE>.

=back

=item *

C<SUPPRESSED> - Indicates that you reviewed the finding and don't
believe that any action is needed.

The workflow status of a C<SUPPRESSED> finding does not change if
C<RecordState> changes from C<ARCHIVED> to C<ACTIVE>.

=item *

C<RESOLVED> - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
considered resolved.

The finding remains C<RESOLVED> unless one of the following occurs:

=over

=item *

C<RecordState> changes from C<ARCHIVED> to C<ACTIVE>.

=item *

C<Compliance.Status> changes from C<PASSED> to C<FAILED>, C<WARNING>,
or C<NOT_AVAILABLE>.

=back

In those cases, the workflow status is automatically reset to C<NEW>.

For findings from controls, if C<Compliance.Status> is C<PASSED>, then
Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to C<RESOLVED>.
