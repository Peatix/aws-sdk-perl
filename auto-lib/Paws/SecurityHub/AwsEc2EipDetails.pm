=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2EipDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationId => $value, ..., PublicIpv4Pool => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEc2EipDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an Elastic IP address.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationId => Str

The identifier that Amazon Web Services assigns to represent the
allocation of the Elastic IP address for use with Amazon VPC.


=head2 AssociationId => Str

=head2 InstanceId => Str

The identifier of the EC2 instance.


=head2 NetworkBorderGroup => Str

The name of the location from which the Elastic IP address is
advertised.


=head2 NetworkInterfaceId => Str
