Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceLoadBalancersDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceLoadBalancersDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerName => $value, ..., TargetGroupArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityHub::AwsEcsServiceLoadBalancersDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a load balancer that the service uses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerName => Str

The name of the container to associate with the load balancer.


=head2 ContainerPort => Int

The port on the container to associate with the load balancer. This
port must correspond to a C<containerPort> in the task definition the
tasks in the service are using. For tasks that use the EC2 launch type,
the container instance they are launched on must allow ingress traffic
on the C<hostPort> of the port mapping.


=head2 LoadBalancerName => Str

The name of the load balancer to associate with the Amazon ECS service
or task set.

Only specified when using a Classic Load Balancer. For an Application
Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer, the load balancer name is
omitted.


=head2 TargetGroupArn => Str

The ARN of the Elastic Load Balancing target group or groups associated
with a service or task set.

Only specified when using an Application Load Balancer or a Network
Load Balancer. For a Classic Load Balancer, the target group ARN is
omitted.
