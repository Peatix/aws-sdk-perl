Paws::GuardDuty::DetectorFeatureConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GuardDuty::DetectorFeatureConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalConfiguration => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GuardDuty::DetectorFeatureConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a GuardDuty feature.

Specifying both EKS Runtime Monitoring (C<EKS_RUNTIME_MONITORING>) and
Runtime Monitoring (C<RUNTIME_MONITORING>) will cause an error. You can
add only one of these two features because Runtime Monitoring already
includes the threat detection for Amazon EKS resources. For more
information, see Runtime Monitoring
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/runtime-monitoring.html).
