Paws::GuardDuty::FindingStatistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GuardDuty::FindingStatistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CountBySeverity => $value, ..., GroupedBySeverity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GuardDuty::FindingStatistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CountBySeverity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about finding statistics.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CountBySeverity => L<Paws::GuardDuty::CountBySeverity>

Represents a list of map of severity to count statistics for a set of
findings.


=head2 GroupedByAccount => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::AccountStatistics>]

Represents a list of map of accounts with a findings count associated
with each account.


=head2 GroupedByDate => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::DateStatistics>]

Represents a list of map of dates with a count of total findings
generated on each date per severity level.


=head2 GroupedByFindingType => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::FindingTypeStatistics>]

Represents a list of map of finding types with a count of total
findings generated for each type.

Based on the C<orderBy> parameter, this request returns either the most
occurring finding types or the least occurring finding types. If the
C<orderBy> parameter is C<ASC>, this will represent the least occurring
finding types in your account; otherwise, this will represent the most
occurring finding types. The default value of C<orderBy> is C<DESC>.


=head2 GroupedByResource => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::ResourceStatistics>]

Represents a list of map of top resources with a count of total
findings.


=head2 GroupedBySeverity => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::SeverityStatistics>]

Represents a list of map of total findings for each severity level.
