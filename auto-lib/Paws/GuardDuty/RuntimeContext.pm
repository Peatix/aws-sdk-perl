=head1 NAME

Paws::GuardDuty::RuntimeContext

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GuardDuty::RuntimeContext object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddressFamily => $value, ..., ToolName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GuardDuty::RuntimeContext object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddressFamily

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additional information about the suspicious activity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddressFamily => Str

Represents the communication protocol associated with the address. For
example, the address family C<AF_INET> is used for IP version of 4
protocol.


=head2 CommandLineExample => Str

Example of the command line involved in the suspicious activity.


=head2 FileSystemType => Str

Represents the type of mounted fileSystem.


=head2 Flags => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Represents options that control the behavior of a runtime operation or
action. For example, a filesystem mount operation may contain a
read-only flag.


=head2 IanaProtocolNumber => Int

Specifies a particular protocol within the address family. Usually
there is a single protocol in address families. For example, the
address family C<AF_INET> only has the IP protocol.


=head2 LdPreloadValue => Str

The value of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.


=head2 LibraryPath => Str

The path to the new library that was loaded.


=head2 MemoryRegions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the Region of a process's address space such as stack and
heap.


=head2 ModifiedAt => Str

The timestamp at which the process modified the current process. The
timestamp is in UTC date string format.


=head2 ModifyingProcess => L<Paws::GuardDuty::ProcessDetails>

Information about the process that modified the current process. This
is available for multiple finding types.


=head2 ModuleFilePath => Str

The path to the module loaded into the kernel.


=head2 ModuleName => Str

The name of the module loaded into the kernel.


=head2 ModuleSha256 => Str

The C<SHA256> hash of the module.


=head2 MountSource => Str

The path on the host that is mounted by the container.


=head2 MountTarget => Str

The path in the container that is mapped to the host directory.


=head2 ReleaseAgentPath => Str

The path in the container that modified the release agent file.


=head2 RuncBinaryPath => Str

The path to the leveraged C<runc> implementation.


=head2 ScriptPath => Str

The path to the script that was executed.


=head2 ServiceName => Str

Name of the security service that has been potentially disabled.


=head2 ShellHistoryFilePath => Str

The path to the modified shell history file.


=head2 SocketPath => Str

The path to the docket socket that was accessed.


=head2 TargetProcess => L<Paws::GuardDuty::ProcessDetails>

Information about the process that had its memory overwritten by the
current process.


=head2 ThreatFilePath => Str

The suspicious file path for which the threat intelligence details were
found.


=head2 ToolCategory => Str

Category that the tool belongs to. Some of the examples are Backdoor
Tool, Pentest Tool, Network Scanner, and Network Sniffer.


=head2 ToolName => Str

Name of the potentially suspicious tool.
