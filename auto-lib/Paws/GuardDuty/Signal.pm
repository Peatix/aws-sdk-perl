=head1 NAME

Paws::GuardDuty::Signal

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GuardDuty::Signal object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActorIds => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GuardDuty::Signal object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActorIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the signals involved in the attack sequence.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActorIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Information about the IDs of the threat actors involved in the signal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Count => Int

The number of times this signal was observed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The timestamp when the first finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the signal.


=head2 EndpointIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Information about the endpoint IDs associated with this signal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirstSeenAt => Str

The timestamp when the first finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastSeenAt => Str

The timestamp when the last finding or activity related to this signal
was observed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the signal. For example, when signal type is C<FINDING>,
the signal name is the name of the finding.


=head2 ResourceUids => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Information about the unique identifiers of the resources involved in
the signal.


=head2 Severity => Num

The severity associated with the signal. For more information about
severity, see Findings severity levels
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_findings-severity.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.


=head2 SignalIndicators => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GuardDuty::Indicator>]

Contains information about the indicators associated with the signals.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of the signal used to identify an attack sequence.

Signals can be GuardDuty findings or activities observed in data
sources that GuardDuty monitors. For more information, see Foundational
data sources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/guardduty_data-sources.html)
in the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

A signal type can be one of the valid values listed in this API. Here
are the related descriptions:

=over

=item *

C<FINDING> - Individually generated GuardDuty finding.

=item *

C<CLOUD_TRAIL> - Activity observed from CloudTrail logs

=item *

C<S3_DATA_EVENTS> - Activity observed from CloudTrail data events for
S3. Activities associated with this type will show up only when you
have enabled GuardDuty S3 Protection feature in your account. For more
information about S3 Protection and steps to enable it, see S3
Protection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3-protection.html) in
the I<Amazon GuardDuty User Guide>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Uid => Str

The unique identifier of the signal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdatedAt => Str

The timestamp when this signal was last observed.
