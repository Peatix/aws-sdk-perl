=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudControl::HookProgressEvent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudControl::HookProgressEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailureMode => $value, ..., InvocationPoint => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudControl::HookProgressEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailureMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the current status of applicable Hooks for a resource
operation request. It contains list of Hook invocation information for
the resource specified in the request since the same target can invoke
multiple Hooks. For more information, see Managing resource operation
requests with Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/resource-operations-manage-requests.html).
