Paws::TimestreamWrite::CreateDatabase - Arguments for method CreateDatabase on L<Paws::TimestreamWrite>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDatabase on the
L<Amazon Timestream Write|Paws::TimestreamWrite> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDatabase.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDatabase.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ingest.timestream = Paws->service('TimestreamWrite');
    my $CreateDatabaseResponse = $ingest . timestream->CreateDatabase(
      DatabaseName => 'MyResourceCreateAPIName',
      KmsKeyId     => 'MyStringValue2048',         # OPTIONAL
      Tags         => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Database = $CreateDatabaseResponse->Database;

    # Returns a L<Paws::TimestreamWrite::CreateDatabaseResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
