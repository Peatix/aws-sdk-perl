=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamWrite::Schema

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamWrite::Schema object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompositePartitionKey => $value, ..., CompositePartitionKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamWrite::Schema object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompositePartitionKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Schema specifies the expected data model of the table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompositePartitionKey => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamWrite::PartitionKey>]

A non-empty list of partition keys defining the attributes used to
partition the table data. The order of the list determines the
partition hierarchy. The name and type of each partition key as well as
the partition key order cannot be changed after the table is created.
However, the enforcement level of each partition key can be changed.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::TimestreamWrite>
