=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamWrite::RejectedRecord

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamWrite::RejectedRecord object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExistingVersion => $value, ..., RecordIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamWrite::RejectedRecord object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExistingVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents records that were not successfully inserted into Timestream
due to data validation issues that must be resolved before reinserting
time-series data into the system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExistingVersion => Int

The existing version of the record. This value is populated in
scenarios where an identical record exists with a higher version than
the version in the write request.


=head2 Reason => Str

The reason why a record was not successfully inserted into Timestream.
Possible causes of failure include:

=over

=item *

Records with duplicate data where there are multiple records with the
same dimensions, timestamps, and measure names but:

=over

=item *

Measure values are different

=item *

Version is not present in the request, I<or> the value of version in
the new record is equal to or lower than the existing value

=back

If Timestream rejects data for this case, the C<ExistingVersion> field
in the C<RejectedRecords> response will indicate the current
recordE<rsquo>s version. To force an update, you can resend the request
with a version for the record set to a value greater than the
C<ExistingVersion>.

=item *

Records with timestamps that lie outside the retention duration of the
memory store.

When the retention window is updated, you will receive a
C<RejectedRecords> exception if you immediately try to ingest data
within the new window. To avoid a C<RejectedRecords> exception, wait
until the duration of the new window to ingest new data. For further
information, see Best Practices for Configuring Timestream
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/best-practices.html#configuration)
and the explanation of how storage works in Timestream
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/storage.html).

=item *

Records with dimensions or measures that exceed the Timestream defined
limits.

=back

For more information, see Access Management
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html)
in the Timestream Developer Guide.


=head2 RecordIndex => Int

The index of the record in the input request for WriteRecords. Indexes
begin with 0.
