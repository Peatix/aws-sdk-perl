=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamWrite::DataModel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamWrite::DataModel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DimensionMappings => $value, ..., TimeUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamWrite::DataModel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DimensionMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data model for a batch load task.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DimensionMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamWrite::DimensionMapping>]

Source to target mappings for dimensions.


=head2 MeasureNameColumn => Str




=head2 MixedMeasureMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamWrite::MixedMeasureMapping>]

Source to target mappings for measures.


=head2 MultiMeasureMappings => L<Paws::TimestreamWrite::MultiMeasureMappings>

Source to target mappings for multi-measure records.


=head2 TimeColumn => Str

Source column to be mapped to time.


=head2 TimeUnit => Str

The granularity of the timestamp unit. It indicates if the time value
is in seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds, or other supported values.
Default is C<MILLISECONDS>.
