=head1 DESCRIPTION

A verified or pending destination phone number in the SMS sandbox.

When you start using Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web
Services account is in the I<SMS sandbox>. The SMS sandbox provides a
safe environment for you to try Amazon SNS features without risking
your reputation as an SMS sender. While your Amazon Web Services
account is in the SMS sandbox, you can use all of the features of
Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS messages only to verified
destination phone numbers. For more information, including how to move
out of the sandbox to send messages without restrictions, see SMS
sandbox
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html) in the
I<Amazon SNS Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
