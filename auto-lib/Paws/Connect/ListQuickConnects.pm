Paws::Connect::ListQuickConnects - Arguments for method ListQuickConnects on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListQuickConnects on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListQuickConnects.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListQuickConnects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    my $ListQuickConnectsResponse = $connect->ListQuickConnects(
      InstanceId        => 'MyInstanceId',
      MaxResults        => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken         => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
      QuickConnectTypes => [
        'USER', ...                          # values: USER, QUEUE, PHONE_NUMBER
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken = $ListQuickConnectsResponse->NextToken;
    my $QuickConnectSummaryList =
      $ListQuickConnectsResponse->QuickConnectSummaryList;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Connect::ListQuickConnectsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
