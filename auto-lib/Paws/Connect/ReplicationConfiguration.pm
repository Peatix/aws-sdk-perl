=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ReplicationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::ReplicationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GlobalSignInEndpoint => $value, ..., SourceRegion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::ReplicationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GlobalSignInEndpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about the status of the replication of a source Amazon Connect
instance across Amazon Web Services Regions. Use these details to
understand the general status of a given replication. For information
about why a replication process may fail, see Why a ReplicateInstance
call fails
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/create-replica-connect-instance.html#why-replicateinstance-fails)
in the I<Create a replica of your existing Amazon Connect instance>
topic in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GlobalSignInEndpoint => Str

The URL that is used to sign-in to your Amazon Connect instance
according to your traffic distribution group configuration. For more
information about sign-in and traffic distribution groups, see
Important things to know
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/setup-traffic-distribution-groups.html)
in the I<Create traffic distribution groups> topic in the I<Amazon
Connect Administrator Guide>.


=head2 ReplicationStatusSummaryList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Connect::ReplicationStatusSummary>]

A list of replication status summaries. The summaries contain details
about the replication of configuration information for Amazon Connect
resources, for each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 SourceRegion => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region where the source Amazon Connect instance
was created. This is the Region where the ReplicateInstance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ReplicateInstance.html)
API was called to start the replication process.
