=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::AgentInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::AgentInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AfterContactWorkDuration => $value, ..., StateTransitions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::AgentInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AfterContactWorkDuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the agent who accepted the contact.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AfterContactWorkDuration => Int

The difference in time, in whole seconds, between
C<AfterContactWorkStartTimestamp> and C<AfterContactWorkEndTimestamp>.


=head2 AfterContactWorkEndTimestamp => Str

The date and time when the agent ended After Contact Work for the
contact, in UTC time. In cases when agent finishes doing
C<AfterContactWork> for chat contacts and switches their activity
status to offline or equivalent without clearing the contact in CCP,
discrepancies may be noticed for C<AfterContactWorkEndTimestamp>.


=head2 AfterContactWorkStartTimestamp => Str

The date and time when the agent started doing After Contact Work for
the contact, in UTC time.


=head2 AgentInitiatedHoldDuration => Int

The total hold duration in seconds initiated by the agent.


=head2 AgentPauseDurationInSeconds => Int

Agent pause duration for a contact in seconds.


=head2 Capabilities => L<Paws::Connect::ParticipantCapabilities>




=head2 ConnectedToAgentTimestamp => Str

The timestamp when the contact was connected to the agent.


=head2 DeviceInfo => L<Paws::Connect::DeviceInfo>

Information regarding AgentE<rsquo>s device.


=head2 HierarchyGroups => L<Paws::Connect::HierarchyGroups>

The agent hierarchy groups for the agent.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the agent who accepted the contact.


=head2 StateTransitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Connect::StateTransition>]

List of C<StateTransition> for a supervisor.
