  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptionType => $value, ..., KeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::EncryptionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptionType
