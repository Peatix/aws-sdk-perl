=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::SearchCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::SearchCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AgentHierarchyGroups => $value, ..., SearchableSegmentAttributes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::SearchCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AgentHierarchyGroups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure of search criteria to be used to return contacts.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AgentHierarchyGroups => L<Paws::Connect::AgentHierarchyGroups>

The agent hierarchy groups of the agent at the time of handling the
contact.


=head2 AgentIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifiers of agents who handled the contacts.


=head2 Channels => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of channels associated with contacts.


=head2 ContactAnalysis => L<Paws::Connect::ContactAnalysis>

Search criteria based on analysis outputs from Amazon Connect Contact
Lens.


=head2 InitiationMethods => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of initiation methods associated with contacts.


=head2 QueueIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of queue IDs associated with contacts.


=head2 SearchableContactAttributes => L<Paws::Connect::SearchableContactAttributes>

The search criteria based on user-defined contact attributes that have
been configured for contact search. For more information, see Search by
custom contact attributes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/search-custom-attributes.html)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.

To use C<SearchableContactAttributes> in a search request, the
C<GetContactAttributes> action is required to perform an API request.

defined by Amazon Connect.


=head2 SearchableSegmentAttributes => L<Paws::Connect::SearchableSegmentAttributes>

The search criteria based on searchable segment attributes of a
contact.
