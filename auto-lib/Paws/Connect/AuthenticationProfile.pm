=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::AuthenticationProfile

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::AuthenticationProfile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedIps => $value, ..., PeriodicSessionDuration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::AuthenticationProfile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedIps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This API is in preview release for Amazon Connect and is subject to
change. To request access to this API, contact Amazon Web
ServicesSupport.

Information about an authentication profile. An authentication profile
is a resource that stores the authentication settings for users in your
contact center. You use authentication profiles to set up IP address
range restrictions and session timeouts. For more information, see Set
IP address restrictions or session timeouts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/authentication-profiles.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedIps => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of IP address range strings that are allowed to access the
Amazon Connect instance. For more information about how to configure IP
addresses, see Configure IP address based access control
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/authentication-profiles.html#configure-ip-based-ac)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the authentication profile.


=head2 BlockedIps => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of IP address range strings that are blocked from accessing the
Amazon Connect instance. For more information about how to configure IP
addresses, see Configure IP address based access control
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/authentication-profiles.html#configure-ip-based-ac)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The timestamp when the authentication profile was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description for the authentication profile.


=head2 Id => Str

A unique identifier for the authentication profile.


=head2 IsDefault => Bool

Shows whether the authentication profile is the default authentication

profile applies to all agents in an Amazon Connect instance, unless
overridden by another authentication profile.


=head2 LastModifiedRegion => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region where the authentication profile was
last modified.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The timestamp when the authentication profile was last modified.


=head2 MaxSessionDuration => Int

The long lived session duration for users logged in to Amazon Connect,
in minutes. After this time period, users must log in again. For more
information, see Configure the session duration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/authentication-profiles.html#configure-session-timeouts)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.


=head2 Name => Str

The name for the authentication profile.


=head2 PeriodicSessionDuration => Int

The short lived session duration configuration for users logged in to
Amazon Connect, in minutes. This value determines the maximum possible
time before an agent is authenticated. For more information, see
Configure the session duration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/authentication-profiles.html#configure-session-timeouts)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.
