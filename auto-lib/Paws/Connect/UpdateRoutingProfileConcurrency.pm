=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency - Arguments for method UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency(
      InstanceId         => 'MyInstanceId',
      MediaConcurrencies => [
        {
          Channel              => 'VOICE',    # values: VOICE, CHAT, TASK, EMAIL
          Concurrency          => 1,          # min: 1, max: 10
          CrossChannelBehavior => {
            BehaviorType => 'ROUTE_CURRENT_CHANNEL_ONLY'
            ,    # values: ROUTE_CURRENT_CHANNEL_ONLY, ROUTE_ANY_CHANNEL

          },    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],
      RoutingProfileId => 'MyRoutingProfileId',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/connect/UpdateRoutingProfileConcurrency>
