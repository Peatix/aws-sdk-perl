=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisTranscriptItemWithContent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CharacterOffsets => $value, ..., Id => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisTranscriptItemWithContent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CharacterOffsets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Transcript representation containing Id, Content and list of character
intervals that are associated with analysis data. For example, this
object within an issue detected would describe both content that
contains identified issue and intervals where that content is taken
from.
