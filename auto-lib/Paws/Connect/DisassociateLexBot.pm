=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::DisassociateLexBot - Arguments for method DisassociateLexBot on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateLexBot on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateLexBot.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateLexBot.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->DisassociateLexBot(
      BotName     => 'MyBotName',
      InstanceId  => 'MyInstanceId',
      LexRegion   => 'MyLexRegion',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
