=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::DisassociateLambdaFunction - Arguments for method DisassociateLambdaFunction on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateLambdaFunction on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateLambdaFunction.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateLambdaFunction.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->DisassociateLambdaFunction(
      FunctionArn => 'MyFunctionArn',
      InstanceId  => 'MyInstanceId',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/connect/DisassociateLambdaFunction>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the

SDK populates this field. For more information about idempotency, see
Making retries safe with idempotent APIs
(https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FunctionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function being
disassociated.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceId => Str

The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the
instance ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html)
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance..
