=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::TrafficDistributionGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::TrafficDistributionGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::TrafficDistributionGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a traffic distribution group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the traffic distribution group.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the traffic distribution group.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the traffic distribution group. This can be the ID or
the ARN if the API is being called in the Region where the traffic
distribution group was created. The ARN must be provided if the call is
from the replicated Region.


=head2 InstanceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN).


=head2 IsDefault => Bool

Whether this is the default traffic distribution group created during
instance replication. The default traffic distribution group cannot be
deleted by the C<DeleteTrafficDistributionGroup> API. The default
traffic distribution group is deleted as part of the process for
deleting a replica.

The C<SignInConfig> distribution is available only on a default
C<TrafficDistributionGroup> (see the C<IsDefault> parameter in the
TrafficDistributionGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_TrafficDistributionGroup.html)
data type). If you call C<UpdateTrafficDistribution> with a modified
C<SignInConfig> and a non-default C<TrafficDistributionGroup>, an
C<InvalidRequestException> is returned.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the traffic distribution group.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the traffic distribution group.
