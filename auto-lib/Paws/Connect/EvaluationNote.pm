Information about notes for a contact evaluation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Value => Str

The note for an item (section or question) in a contact evaluation.

Even though a note in an evaluation can have up to 3072 chars, there is
also a limit on the total number of chars for all the notes in the
evaluation combined. Assuming there are N questions in the evaluation
being submitted, then the max char limit for all notes combined is N x
1024.
