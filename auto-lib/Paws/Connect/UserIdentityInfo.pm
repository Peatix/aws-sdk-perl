=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::UserIdentityInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::UserIdentityInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Email => $value, ..., SecondaryEmail => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::UserIdentityInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Email

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the identity of a user.

For Amazon Connect instances that are created with the
C<EXISTING_DIRECTORY> identity management type, C<FirstName>,
C<LastName>, and C<Email> cannot be updated from within Amazon Connect
because they are managed by the directory.

The C<FirstName> and C<LastName> length constraints below apply only to
instances using SAML for identity management. If you are using Amazon
Connect for identity management, the length constraints are 1-255 for
C<FirstName>, and 1-256 for C<LastName>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Email => Str

The email address. If you are using SAML for identity management and
include this parameter, an error is returned.


=head2 FirstName => Str

The first name. This is required if you are using Amazon Connect or
SAML for identity management. Inputs must be in Unicode Normalization
Form C (NFC). Text containing characters in a non-NFC form (for
example, decomposed characters or combining marks) are not accepted.


=head2 LastName => Str

The last name. This is required if you are using Amazon Connect or SAML
for identity management. Inputs must be in Unicode Normalization Form C
(NFC). Text containing characters in a non-NFC form (for example,
decomposed characters or combining marks) are not accepted.


=head2 Mobile => Str

The user's mobile number.


=head2 SecondaryEmail => Str

The user's secondary email address. If you provide a secondary email,
the user receives email notifications - other than password reset
notifications - to this email address instead of to their primary email
address.

Pattern:
C<(?=^.{0,265}$)[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,63}>
