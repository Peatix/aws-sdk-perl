=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneUserAttributeFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneUserAttributeFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AndCondition => $value, ..., TagCondition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneUserAttributeFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AndCondition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that can be used to specify Tag conditions or Hierarchy Group
conditions inside the C<SearchFilter>.

This accepts an C<OR> of C<AND> (List of List) input where:

=over

=item *

The top level list specifies conditions that need to be applied with
C<OR> operator

=item *

The inner list specifies conditions that need to be applied with C<AND>
operator.

=back

Only one field can be populated. Maximum number of allowed Tag
conditions is 25. Maximum number of allowed Hierarchy Group conditions
is 20.
