=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::RoutingCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::RoutingCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivationTimestamp => $value, ..., Steps => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::RoutingCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivationTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Latest routing criteria on the contact.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActivationTimestamp => Str

The timestamp indicating when the routing criteria is set to active. A
routing criteria is activated when contact is transferred to a queue.
ActivationTimestamp will be set on routing criteria for contacts in
agent queue even though Routing criteria is never activated for
contacts in agent queue.


=head2 Index => Int

Information about the index of the routing criteria.


=head2 Steps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Connect::Step>]

List of routing steps. When Amazon Connect does not find an available
agent meeting the requirements in a step for a given step duration, the
routing criteria will move on to the next step sequentially until a
join is completed with an agent. When all steps are exhausted, the
contact will be offered to any agent in the queue.
