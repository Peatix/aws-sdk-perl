=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::DescribeQueue - Arguments for method DescribeQueue on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeQueue on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeQueue.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeQueue.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    my $DescribeQueueResponse = $connect->DescribeQueue(
      InstanceId => 'MyInstanceId',
      QueueId    => 'MyQueueId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Queue = $DescribeQueueResponse->Queue;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Connect::DescribeQueueResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
