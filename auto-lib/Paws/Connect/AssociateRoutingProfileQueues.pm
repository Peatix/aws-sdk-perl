=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::AssociateRoutingProfileQueues - Arguments for method AssociateRoutingProfileQueues on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AssociateRoutingProfileQueues on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AssociateRoutingProfileQueues.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AssociateRoutingProfileQueues.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->AssociateRoutingProfileQueues(
      InstanceId   => 'MyInstanceId',
      QueueConfigs => [
        {
          Delay          => 1,    # max: 9999
          Priority       => 1,    # min: 1, max: 99
          QueueReference => {
            Channel => 'VOICE',       # values: VOICE, CHAT, TASK, EMAIL
            QueueId => 'MyQueueId',

          },

        },
        ...
      ],
      RoutingProfileId => 'MyRoutingProfileId',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/connect/AssociateRoutingProfileQueues>
