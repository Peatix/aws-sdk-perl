=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisTranscriptItemWithCharacterOffsets

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisTranscriptItemWithCharacterOffsets object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CharacterOffsets => $value, ..., Id => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisTranscriptItemWithCharacterOffsets object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CharacterOffsets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Transcript representation containing Id and list of character intervals
that are associated with analysis data. For example, this object within
a C<RealTimeContactAnalysisPointOfInterest> in
C<Category.MatchedDetails> would have character interval describing
part of the text that matched category.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CharacterOffsets => L<Paws::Connect::RealTimeContactAnalysisCharacterInterval>

List of character intervals within transcript content/text.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

Transcript identifier. Matches the identifier from one of the
TranscriptSegments.
