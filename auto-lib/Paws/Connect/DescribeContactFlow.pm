This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeContactFlow on the

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    my $DescribeContactFlowResponse = $connect->DescribeContactFlow(
      ContactFlowId => 'MyContactFlowId',
      InstanceId    => 'MyInstanceId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ContactFlow = $DescribeContactFlowResponse->ContactFlow;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Connect::DescribeContactFlowResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
