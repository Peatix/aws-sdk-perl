Paws::Connect::DisassociateBot - Arguments for method DisassociateBot on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateBot on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateBot.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateBot.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->DisassociateBot(
      InstanceId  => 'MyInstanceId',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
      LexBot      => {
        LexRegion => 'MyLexRegion',      # max: 60
        Name      => 'MyBotName',        # max: 50

      },    # OPTIONAL
      LexV2Bot => {
        AliasArn => 'MyAliasArn',    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
