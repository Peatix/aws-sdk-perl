=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::MetricFilterV2

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::MetricFilterV2 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricFilterKey => $value, ..., Negate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::MetricFilterV2 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricFilterKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the filter used when retrieving metrics.
C<MetricFiltersV2> can be used on the following metrics:
C<AVG_AGENT_CONNECTING_TIME>, C<CONTACTS_CREATED>, C<CONTACTS_HANDLED>,
C<SUM_CONTACTS_DISCONNECTED>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricFilterKey => Str

The key to use for filtering data.

=head2 MetricFilterValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The values to use for filtering data. Values for metric-level filters
can be either a fixed set of values or a customized list, depending on
the use case.

For valid values of metric-level filters C<INITIATION_METHOD>,
C<DISCONNECT_REASON>, and C<ANSWERING_MACHINE_DETECTION_STATUS>, see
ContactTraceRecord
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/ctr-data-model.html#ctr-ContactTraceRecord)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.

For valid values of the metric-level filter C<FLOWS_OUTCOME_TYPE>, see
the description for the Flow outcome
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-definitions.html#flows-outcome)
metric in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.

For valid values of the metric-level filter
C<BOT_CONVERSATION_OUTCOME_TYPE>, see the description for the Bot
conversations completed
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/bot-metrics.html#bot-conversations-completed-metric)
in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.

For valid values of the metric-level filter C<BOT_INTENT_OUTCOME_TYPE>,
see the description for the Bot intents completed
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/bot-metrics.html#bot-intents-completed-metric)
metric in the I<Amazon Connect Administrator Guide>.


=head2 Negate => Bool

If set to C<true>, the API response contains results that filter out
the results matched by the metric-level filters condition. By default,
C<Negate> is set to C<false>.
