=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::IntervalDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::IntervalDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IntervalPeriod => $value, ..., TimeZone => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::IntervalDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IntervalPeriod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the interval period to use for returning results.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IntervalPeriod => Str

C<IntervalPeriod>: An aggregated grouping applied to request metrics.
Valid C<IntervalPeriod> values are: C<FIFTEEN_MIN> | C<THIRTY_MIN> |
C<HOUR> | C<DAY> | C<WEEK> | C<TOTAL>.

For example, if C<IntervalPeriod> is selected C<THIRTY_MIN>,
C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> differs by 1 day, then Amazon Connect
returns 48 results in the response. Each result is aggregated by the
THIRTY_MIN period. By default Amazon Connect aggregates results based
on the C<TOTAL> interval period.

The following list describes restrictions on C<StartTime> and
C<EndTime> based on what C<IntervalPeriod> is requested.

=item *

C<FIFTEEN_MIN>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must
be less than 3 days.

=item *

C<THIRTY_MIN>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must
be less than 3 days.

=item *

C<HOUR>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must be
less than 3 days.

=item *

C<DAY>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must be less
than 35 days.

=item *

C<WEEK>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must be
less than 35 days.

=item *

C<TOTAL>: The difference between C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> must be
