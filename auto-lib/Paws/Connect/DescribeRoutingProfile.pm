=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::DescribeRoutingProfile - Arguments for method DescribeRoutingProfile on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeRoutingProfile on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeRoutingProfile.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeRoutingProfile.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    my $DescribeRoutingProfileResponse = $connect->DescribeRoutingProfile(
      InstanceId       => 'MyInstanceId',
      RoutingProfileId => 'MyRoutingProfileId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $RoutingProfile = $DescribeRoutingProfileResponse->RoutingProfile;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Connect::DescribeRoutingProfileResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
