=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::PhoneNumberStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::PhoneNumberStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Message => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::PhoneNumberStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The status of the phone number.

=item *

C<CLAIMED> means the previous ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html)
or UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html)
operation succeeded.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> means a ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html),
UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html),
or UpdatePhoneNumberMetadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumberMetadata.html)
operation is still in progress and has not yet completed. You can call
DescribePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePhoneNumber.html)
at a later time to verify if the previous operation has completed.

=item *

C<FAILED> indicates that the previous ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html)
or UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html)
operation has failed. It will include a message indicating the failure
reason. A common reason for a failure may be that the C<TargetArn>
value you are claiming or updating a phone number to has reached its
limit of total claimed numbers. If you received a C<FAILED> status from
a C<ClaimPhoneNumber> API call, you have one day to retry claiming the
phone number before the number is released back to the inventory for
other customers to claim.
