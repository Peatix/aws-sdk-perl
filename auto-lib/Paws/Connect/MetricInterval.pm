=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::MetricInterval

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::MetricInterval object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndTime => $value, ..., StartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::MetricInterval object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The interval period with the start and end time for the metrics.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndTime => Str

The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format. End time is based on the
interval period selected. For example, If C<IntervalPeriod> is selected
C<THIRTY_MIN>, C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> in the API request differs
by 1 day, then 48 results are returned in the response. Each result is
aggregated by the 30 minutes period, with each C<StartTime> and
C<EndTime> differing by 30 minutes.


=head2 Interval => Str

The interval period provided in the API request.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The timestamp, in UNIX Epoch time format. Start time is based on the
interval period selected.
