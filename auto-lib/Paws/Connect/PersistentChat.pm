=head2 RehydrationType => Str

The contactId that is used for rehydration depends on the rehydration
type. RehydrationType is required for persistent chat.

C<ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION>: Rehydrates a chat from the most recently
terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat session.
To use this type, provide the C<initialContactId> of the past ended

Connect determines the most recent chat contact on the specified chat
session that has ended, and uses it to start a persistent chat.

specified in the C<sourceContactId> field.
