=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ParticipantTimerConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::ParticipantTimerConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ParticipantRole => $value, ..., TimerValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::ParticipantTimerConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ParticipantRole

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration information for the timer. After the timer configuration
is set, it persists for the duration of the chat. It persists across
new contacts in the chain, for example, transfer contacts.

For more information about how chat timeouts work, see Set up chat
timeouts for human participants
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/setup-chat-timeouts.html).

=head2 B<REQUIRED> ParticipantRole => Str

=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimerType => Str

The type of timer. C<IDLE> indicates the timer applies for considering
a human chat participant as idle. C<DISCONNECT_NONCUSTOMER> indicates
the timer applies to automatically disconnecting a chat participant due
to idleness.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimerValue => L<Paws::Connect::ParticipantTimerValue>

The value of the timer. Either the timer action (Unset to delete the
