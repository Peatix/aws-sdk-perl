=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ClaimedPhoneNumberSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::ClaimedPhoneNumberSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceId => $value, ..., TargetArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::ClaimedPhoneNumberSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a phone number that has been claimed to your Amazon
Connect instance or traffic distribution group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstanceId => Str

The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance that phone numbers are

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html)
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.

The phone number. Phone numbers are formatted C<[+] [country code]
[subscriber number including area code]>.


=head2 PhoneNumberArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the phone number.


=head2 PhoneNumberCountryCode => Str

The ISO country code.


=head2 PhoneNumberDescription => Str

=over

=item *

C<CLAIMED> means the previous ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html)
or UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html)
operation succeeded.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> means a ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html),
UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html),
or UpdatePhoneNumberMetadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumberMetadata.html)
operation is still in progress and has not yet completed. You can call
DescribePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_DescribePhoneNumber.html)
at a later time to verify if the previous operation has completed.

=item *

C<FAILED> indicates that the previous ClaimPhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_ClaimPhoneNumber.html)
or UpdatePhoneNumber
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_UpdatePhoneNumber.html)
operation has failed. It will include a message indicating the failure
reason. A common reason for a failure may be that the C<TargetArn>
value you are claiming or updating a phone number to has reached its
limit of total claimed numbers. If you received a C<FAILED> status from
a C<ClaimPhoneNumber> API call, you have one day to retry claiming the
phone number before the number is released back to the inventory for
other customers to claim.

=back

You will not be billed for the phone number during the 1-day period if
number claiming fails.


=head2 PhoneNumberType => Str

=head2 SourcePhoneNumberArn => Str

The claimed phone number ARN that was previously imported from the
external service, such as Amazon Web Services End User Messaging. If it
is from Amazon Web Services End User Messaging, it looks like the ARN
of the phone number that was imported from Amazon Web Services End User
Messaging.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Connect::TagMap>

The tags used to organize, track, or control access for this resource.
For example, { "Tags": {"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"} }.


=head2 TargetArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for Amazon Connect instances or traffic
distribution groups that phone number inbound traffic is routed
through.
