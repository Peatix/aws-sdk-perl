=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneTagFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneTagFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AndConditions => $value, ..., TagCondition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Connect::ControlPlaneTagFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AndConditions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that can be used to specify Tag conditions inside the
C<SearchFilter>. This accepts an C<OR> of C<AND> (List of List) input
where:

=over

=item *

Top level list specifies conditions that need to be applied with C<OR>
operator

=item *

Inner list specifies conditions that need to be applied with C<AND>
operator.
