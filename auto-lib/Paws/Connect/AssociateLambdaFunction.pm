=head1 NAME

Paws::Connect::AssociateLambdaFunction - Arguments for method AssociateLambdaFunction on L<Paws::Connect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AssociateLambdaFunction on the
L<Amazon Connect Service|Paws::Connect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AssociateLambdaFunction.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AssociateLambdaFunction.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $connect = Paws->service('Connect');
    $connect->AssociateLambdaFunction(
      FunctionArn => 'MyFunctionArn',
      InstanceId  => 'MyInstanceId',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/connect/AssociateLambdaFunction>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. If not provided, the Amazon Web Services
SDK populates this field. For more information about idempotency, see
Making retries safe with idempotent APIs
(https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/making-retries-safe-with-idempotent-APIs/).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FunctionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function being
associated. Maximum number of characters allowed is 140.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceId => Str

The identifier of the Amazon Connect instance. You can find the
instance ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html)
in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance.
