=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::NewGatingRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::NewGatingRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ControlPanelArn => $value, ..., WaitPeriodMs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::NewGatingRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ControlPanelArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A new gating rule for a control panel.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ControlPanelArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GatingControls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The gating controls for the new gating rule. That is, routing controls
that are evaluated by the rule configuration that you specify.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name for the new gating rule.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleConfig => L<Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::RuleConfig>

The criteria that you set for specific gating controls (routing
controls) that designate how many control states must be ON to allow
you to change (set or unset) the target control states.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetControls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Routing controls that can only be set or unset if the specified
RuleConfig evaluates to true for the specified GatingControls. For
example, say you have three gating controls, one for each of three
Amazon Web Services Regions. Now you specify ATLEAST 2 as your
RuleConfig. With these settings, you can only change (set or unset) the
routing controls that you have specified as TargetControls if that rule
evaluates to true.

In other words, your ability to change the routing controls that you
have specified as TargetControls is gated by the rule that you set for
the routing controls in GatingControls.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WaitPeriodMs => Int

An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request
against the target routing controls will fail. This helps prevent
"flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by default, but you can
choose a custom value.
