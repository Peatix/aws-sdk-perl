=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::AssertionRuleUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::AssertionRuleUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., WaitPeriodMs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::AssertionRuleUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An update to an assertion rule. You can update the name or the
evaluation period (wait period). If you don't specify one of the items
to update, the item is unchanged.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the assertion rule. You can use any non-white space
character in the name.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SafetyRuleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WaitPeriodMs => Int

An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any request
against the target routing controls will fail. This helps prevent
"flapping" of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by default, but you can
choose a custom value.
