=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::RuleConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::RuleConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inverted => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::RuleConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inverted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rule configuration for an assertion rule. That is, the criteria
that you set for specific assertion controls (routing controls) that
specify how many control states must be ON after a transaction
completes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inverted => Bool

Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually evaluate true,
it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Threshold => Int

The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule type. That is,
Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when you specify
an ATLEAST type.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.
