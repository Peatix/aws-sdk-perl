=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::Rule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::Rule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ASSERTION => $value, ..., GATING => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::Rule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ASSERTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A safety rule. A safety rule can be an assertion rule or a gating rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ASSERTION => L<Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::AssertionRule>

An assertion rule enforces that, when a routing control state is
changed, the criteria set by the rule configuration is met. Otherwise,
the change to the routing control state is not accepted. For example,
the criteria might be that at least one routing control state is On
after the transaction so that traffic continues to flow to at least one
cell for the application. This ensures that you avoid a fail-open
scenario.


=head2 GATING => L<Paws::Route53RecoveryControlConfig::GatingRule>

A gating rule verifies that a gating routing control or set of gating
routing controls, evaluates as true, based on a rule configuration that
you specify, which allows a set of routing control state changes to
complete.

For example, if you specify one gating routing control and you set the
Type in the rule configuration to OR, that indicates that you must set
the gating routing control to On for the rule to evaluate as true; that
is, for the gating control "switch" to be "On". When you do that, then
you can update the routing control states for the target routing
controls that you specify in the gating rule.
