=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::Metrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::Metrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AverageWeightedQuantileLoss => $value, ..., WeightedQuantileLosses => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::Metrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AverageWeightedQuantileLoss

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of a
predictor. This object is part of the WindowSummary object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AverageWeightedQuantileLoss => Num

The average value of all weighted quantile losses.


=head2 ErrorMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::ErrorMetric>]

Provides detailed error metrics for each forecast type. Metrics include
root-mean square-error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),
mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and weighted average percentage
error (WAPE).


=head2 RMSE => Num

The root-mean-square error (RMSE).


=head2 WeightedQuantileLosses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::WeightedQuantileLoss>]

An array of weighted quantile losses. Quantiles divide a probability
distribution into regions of equal probability. The distribution in
this case is the loss function.



=head1 SEE ALSO
