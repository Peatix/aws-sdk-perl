=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilityConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilityConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TimePointGranularity => $value, ..., TimeSeriesGranularity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilityConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TimePointGranularity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ExplainabilityConfig data type defines the number of time series
and time points included in CreateExplainability.

If you provide a predictor ARN for C<ResourceArn>, you must set both
C<TimePointGranularity> and C<TimeSeriesGranularity> to
E<ldquo>ALLE<rdquo>. When creating Predictor Explainability, Amazon
Forecast considers all time series and time points.

If you provide a forecast ARN for C<ResourceArn>, you can set
C<TimePointGranularity> and C<TimeSeriesGranularity> to either
E<ldquo>ALLE<rdquo> or E<ldquo>SpecificE<rdquo>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimePointGranularity => Str

To create an Explainability for all time points in your forecast
horizon, use C<ALL>. To create an Explainability for specific time
points in your forecast horizon, use C<SPECIFIC>.

Specify time points with the C<StartDateTime> and C<EndDateTime>
parameters within the CreateExplainability operation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeSeriesGranularity => Str

To create an Explainability for all time series in your datasets, use
C<ALL>. To create an Explainability for specific time series in your
datasets, use C<SPECIFIC>.

Specify time series by uploading a CSV or Parquet file to an Amazon S3
bucket and set the location within the DataDestination data type.
