=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::Baseline

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::Baseline object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PredictorBaseline => $value, ..., PredictorBaseline => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::Baseline object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PredictorBaseline

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metrics you can use as a baseline for comparison purposes. Use these
metrics when you interpret monitoring results for an auto predictor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PredictorBaseline => L<Paws::Forecast::PredictorBaseline>

The initial accuracy metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/metrics.html) for the
predictor you are monitoring. Use these metrics as a baseline for
comparison purposes as you use your predictor and the metrics change.
