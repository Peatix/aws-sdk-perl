=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::PredictorMonitorEvaluation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::PredictorMonitorEvaluation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EvaluationState => $value, ..., WindowStartDatetime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::PredictorMonitorEvaluation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EvaluationState

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the results of a monitor evaluation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EvaluationState => Str

The status of the monitor evaluation. The state can be C<SUCCESS> or
C<FAILURE>.


=head2 EvaluationTime => Str

The timestamp that indicates when the monitor evaluation was started.


=head2 Message => Str

Information about any errors that may have occurred during the monitor
evaluation.


=head2 MetricResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::MetricResult>]

A list of metrics Forecast calculated when monitoring a predictor. You
can compare the value for each metric in the list to the metric's value
in the Baseline to see how your predictor's performance is changing.


=head2 MonitorArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the monitor resource.


=head2 MonitorDataSource => L<Paws::Forecast::MonitorDataSource>

The source of the data the monitor resource used during the evaluation.


=head2 NumItemsEvaluated => Int

The number of items considered during the evaluation.


=head2 PredictorEvent => L<Paws::Forecast::PredictorEvent>

Provides details about a predictor event, such as a retraining.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource to monitor.


=head2 WindowEndDatetime => Str

The timestamp that indicates the end of the window that is used for
monitor evaluation.


=head2 WindowStartDatetime => Str

The timestamp that indicates the start of the window that is used for
monitor evaluation.
