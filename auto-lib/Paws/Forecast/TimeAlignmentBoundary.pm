Paws::Forecast::TimeAlignmentBoundary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::TimeAlignmentBoundary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DayOfMonth => $value, ..., Month => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::TimeAlignmentBoundary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DayOfMonth

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The time boundary Forecast uses to align and aggregate your data to
match your forecast frequency. Provide the unit of time and the time
boundary as a key value pair. If you don't provide a time boundary,
Forecast uses a set of Default Time Boundaries
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/data-aggregation.html#default-time-boundaries).

For more information about aggregation, see Data Aggregation for
Different Forecast Frequencies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/data-aggregation.html).
For more information setting a custom time boundary, see Specifying a
Time Boundary
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/data-aggregation.html#specifying-time-boundary).
