=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::DatasetImportJobSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::DatasetImportJobSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::DatasetImportJobSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a summary of the dataset import job properties used in the
ListDatasetImportJobs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_ListDatasetImportJobs.html)
operation. To get the complete set of properties, call the
DescribeDatasetImportJob
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_DescribeDatasetImportJob.html)
operation, and provide the C<DatasetImportJobArn>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

When the dataset import job was created.


=head2 DatasetImportJobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job.


=head2 DatasetImportJobName => Str

The name of the dataset import job.


=head2 DataSource => L<Paws::Forecast::DataSource>

The location of the training data to import and an Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the
data. The training data must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

If encryption is used, C<DataSource> includes an Key Management Service
(KMS) key.


=head2 ImportMode => Str

The import mode of the dataset import job, FULL or INCREMENTAL.


=head2 LastModificationTime => Str

The last time the resource was modified. The timestamp depends on the
status of the job:

=over

=item *

C<CREATE_PENDING> - The C<CreationTime>.

=item *

C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS> - The current timestamp.

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPING> - The current timestamp.

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPED> - When the job stopped.

=item *

C<ACTIVE> or C<CREATE_FAILED> - When the job finished or failed.

=back



=head2 Message => Str

If an error occurred, an informational message about the error.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the dataset import job. States include:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE>

=item *

C<CREATE_PENDING>, C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<CREATE_FAILED>

=item *

C<DELETE_PENDING>, C<DELETE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<DELETE_FAILED>

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPING>, C<CREATE_STOPPED>
