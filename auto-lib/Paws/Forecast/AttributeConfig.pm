=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::AttributeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::AttributeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeName => $value, ..., Transformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::AttributeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the method used to transform attributes.

The following is an example using the RETAIL domain:

C<{>

C<"AttributeName": "demand",>

C<"Transformations": {"aggregation": "sum", "middlefill": "zero",
"backfill": "zero"}>

C<}>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeName => Str

The name of the attribute as specified in the schema. Amazon Forecast
supports the target field of the target time series and the related
time series datasets. For example, for the RETAIL domain, the target is
C<demand>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Transformations => L<Paws::Forecast::Transformations>

The method parameters (key-value pairs), which are a map of override
parameters. Specify these parameters to override the default values.
Related Time Series attributes do not accept aggregation parameters.

The following list shows the parameters and their valid values for the
"filling" featurization method for a B<Target Time Series> dataset.
Default values are bolded.

=over

=item *

C<aggregation>: B<sum>, C<avg>, C<first>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<frontfill>: B<none>

=item *

C<middlefill>: B<zero>, C<nan> (not a number), C<value>, C<median>,
C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<backfill>: B<zero>, C<nan>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>,
C<max>

=back

The following list shows the parameters and their valid values for a
B<Related Time Series> featurization method (there are no defaults):

=over

=item *

C<middlefill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<backfill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<futurefill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=back

To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill parameter to
C<value> and define the value in a corresponding C<_value> parameter.
For example, to set backfilling to a value of 2, include the following:
C<"backfill": "value"> and C<"backfill_value":"2">.
