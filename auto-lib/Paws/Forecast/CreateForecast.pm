=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::CreateForecast - Arguments for method CreateForecast on L<Paws::Forecast>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateForecast on the
L<Amazon Forecast Service|Paws::Forecast> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateForecast.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateForecast.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $forecast = Paws->service('Forecast');
    my $CreateForecastResponse = $forecast->CreateForecast(
      ForecastName  => 'MyName',
      PredictorArn  => 'MyArn',
      ForecastTypes => [
        'MyForecastType', ...    # min: 2, max: 4
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      TimeSeriesSelector => {
        TimeSeriesIdentifiers => {
          DataSource => {
            S3Config => {
              Path      => 'MyS3Path',       # min: 7, max: 4096
              RoleArn   => 'MyArn',          # max: 256
              KMSKeyArn => 'MyKMSKeyArn',    # max: 256; OPTIONAL
            },

          },    # OPTIONAL
          Format => 'MyFormat',    # max: 7; OPTIONAL
          Schema => {
            Attributes => [
              {
                AttributeName => 'MyName',    # min: 1, max: 63
                AttributeType => 'string'
                , # values: string, integer, float, timestamp, geolocation; OPTIONAL
              },
              ...
            ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
          },    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ForecastArn = $CreateForecastResponse->ForecastArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Forecast::CreateForecastResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ForecastName => Str

A name for the forecast.



=head2 ForecastTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The quantiles at which probabilistic forecasts are generated. B<You can
currently specify up to 5 quantiles per forecast>. Accepted values
include C<0.01 to 0.99> (increments of .01 only) and C<mean>. The mean
forecast is different from the median (0.50) when the distribution is
not symmetric (for example, Beta and Negative Binomial).

The default quantiles are the quantiles you specified during predictor
creation. If you didn't specify quantiles, the default values are
C<["0.1", "0.5", "0.9"]>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PredictorArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the predictor to use to generate the
forecast.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::Tag>]

The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast to help you
categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

=over

=item *

Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

=item *

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.

=item *

Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @.

=item *

Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

=item *

Do not use C<aws:>, C<AWS:>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
have this prefix. If a tag value has C<aws> as its prefix but the key
does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count
against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of C<aws>
do not count against your tags per resource limit.

=back




=head2 TimeSeriesSelector => L<Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesSelector>

Defines the set of time series that are used to create the forecasts in
a C<TimeSeriesIdentifiers> object.

The C<TimeSeriesIdentifiers> object needs the following information:

=over

=item *

C<DataSource>

=item *

C<Format>

=item *

C<Schema>
