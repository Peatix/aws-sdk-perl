=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Format => $value, ..., TimestampFormat => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesReplacementsDataSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Format

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A replacement dataset is a modified version of the baseline related
time series that contains only the values that you want to include in a
what-if forecast. The replacement dataset must contain the forecast
dimensions and item identifiers in the baseline related time series as
well as at least 1 changed time series. This dataset is merged with the
baseline related time series to create a transformed dataset that is
used for the what-if forecast.
