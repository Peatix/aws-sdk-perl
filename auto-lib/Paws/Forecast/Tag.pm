=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::Tag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::Tag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::Tag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The optional metadata that you apply to a resource to help you
categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

=over

=item *

Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

=item *

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.

=item *

Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @.

=item *

Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

=item *

Do not use C<aws:>, C<AWS:>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
have this prefix. If a tag value has C<aws> as its prefix but the key
does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count
against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of C<aws>
do not count against your tags per resource limit.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A C<key> is a general
label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Str

The optional part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A C<value>
acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
