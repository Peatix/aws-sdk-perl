=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::CreateForecastExportJob - Arguments for method CreateForecastExportJob on L<Paws::Forecast>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateForecastExportJob on the
L<Amazon Forecast Service|Paws::Forecast> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateForecastExportJob.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateForecastExportJob.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $forecast = Paws->service('Forecast');
    my $CreateForecastExportJobResponse = $forecast->CreateForecastExportJob(
      Destination => {
        S3Config => {
          Path      => 'MyS3Path',       # min: 7, max: 4096
          RoleArn   => 'MyArn',          # max: 256
          KMSKeyArn => 'MyKMSKeyArn',    # max: 256; OPTIONAL
        },

      },
      ForecastArn           => 'MyArn',
      ForecastExportJobName => 'MyName',
      Format                => 'MyFormat',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags                  => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ForecastExportJobArn =
      $CreateForecastExportJobResponse->ForecastExportJobArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Forecast::CreateForecastExportJobResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destination => L<Paws::Forecast::DataDestination>

The location where you want to save the forecast and an Identity and
Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access
the location. The forecast must be exported to an Amazon S3 bucket.

If encryption is used, C<Destination> must include an Key Management
Service (KMS) key. The IAM role must allow Amazon Forecast permission
to access the key.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ForecastArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the forecast that you want to export.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ForecastExportJobName => Str

The name for the forecast export job.



=head2 Format => Str

The format of the exported data, CSV or PARQUET. The default value is
CSV.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::Tag>]

The optional metadata that you apply to the forecast export job to help
you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

=over

=item *

Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

=item *

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.

=item *

Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @.

=item *

Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

=item *

Do not use C<aws:>, C<AWS:>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
have this prefix. If a tag value has C<aws> as its prefix but the key
does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count
against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of C<aws>
do not count against your tags per resource limit.
