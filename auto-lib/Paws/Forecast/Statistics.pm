=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::Statistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::Statistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Avg => $value, ..., Stddev => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::Statistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Avg

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides statistics for each data field imported into to an Amazon
Forecast dataset with the CreateDatasetImportJob
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetImportJob.html)
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Avg => Num

For a numeric field, the average value in the field.


=head2 Count => Int

The number of values in the field. If the response value is -1, refer
to C<CountLong>.


=head2 CountDistinct => Int

The number of distinct values in the field. If the response value is
-1, refer to C<CountDistinctLong>.


=head2 CountDistinctLong => Int

The number of distinct values in the field. C<CountDistinctLong> is
used instead of C<CountDistinct> if the value is greater than
2,147,483,647.


=head2 CountLong => Int

The number of values in the field. C<CountLong> is used instead of
C<Count> if the value is greater than 2,147,483,647.


=head2 CountNan => Int

The number of NAN (not a number) values in the field. If the response
value is -1, refer to C<CountNanLong>.


=head2 CountNanLong => Int

The number of NAN (not a number) values in the field. C<CountNanLong>
is used instead of C<CountNan> if the value is greater than
2,147,483,647.


=head2 CountNull => Int

The number of null values in the field. If the response value is -1,
refer to C<CountNullLong>.


=head2 CountNullLong => Int

The number of null values in the field. C<CountNullLong> is used
instead of C<CountNull> if the value is greater than 2,147,483,647.


=head2 Max => Str

For a numeric field, the maximum value in the field.


=head2 Min => Str

For a numeric field, the minimum value in the field.


=head2 Stddev => Num

For a numeric field, the standard deviation.
