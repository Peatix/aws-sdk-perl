=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::CreateDataset - Arguments for method CreateDataset on L<Paws::Forecast>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDataset on the
L<Amazon Forecast Service|Paws::Forecast> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDataset.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDataset.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $forecast = Paws->service('Forecast');
    my $CreateDatasetResponse = $forecast->CreateDataset(
      DatasetName => 'MyName',
      DatasetType => 'TARGET_TIME_SERIES',
      Domain      => 'RETAIL',
      Schema      => {
        Attributes => [
          {
            AttributeName => 'MyName',    # min: 1, max: 63
            AttributeType => 'string'
            , # values: string, integer, float, timestamp, geolocation; OPTIONAL
          },
          ...
        ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
      },
      DataFrequency    => 'MyFrequency',    # OPTIONAL
      EncryptionConfig => {
        KMSKeyArn => 'MyKMSKeyArn',         # max: 256
        RoleArn   => 'MyArn',               # max: 256

      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DatasetArn = $CreateDatasetResponse->DatasetArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Forecast::CreateDatasetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataFrequency => Str

The frequency of data collection. This parameter is required for
RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets.

Valid intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W
(Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D"
indicates every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot
specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That
means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes,
because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each
frequency are the following:

=over

=item *

Minute - 1-59

=item *

Hour - 1-23

=item *

Day - 1-6

=item *

Week - 1-4

=item *

Month - 1-11

=item *

Year - 1

=back

Thus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if you
want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M".



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetName => Str

A name for the dataset.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetType => Str

The dataset type. Valid values depend on the chosen C<Domain>.

Valid values are: C<"TARGET_TIME_SERIES">, C<"RELATED_TIME_SERIES">, C<"ITEM_METADATA">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Domain => Str

The domain associated with the dataset. When you add a dataset to a
dataset group, this value and the value specified for the C<Domain>
parameter of the CreateDatasetGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetGroup.html)
operation must match.

The C<Domain> and C<DatasetType> that you choose determine the fields
that must be present in the training data that you import to the
dataset. For example, if you choose the C<RETAIL> domain and
C<TARGET_TIME_SERIES> as the C<DatasetType>, Amazon Forecast requires
C<item_id>, C<timestamp>, and C<demand> fields to be present in your
data. For more information, see Importing datasets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-datasets-groups.html).

Valid values are: C<"RETAIL">, C<"CUSTOM">, C<"INVENTORY_PLANNING">, C<"EC2_CAPACITY">, C<"WORK_FORCE">, C<"WEB_TRAFFIC">, C<"METRICS">

=head2 EncryptionConfig => L<Paws::Forecast::EncryptionConfig>

An Key Management Service (KMS) key and the Identity and Access
Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the
key.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Schema => L<Paws::Forecast::Schema>

The schema for the dataset. The schema attributes and their order must
match the fields in your data. The dataset C<Domain> and C<DatasetType>
that you choose determine the minimum required fields in your training
data. For information about the required fields for a specific dataset
domain and type, see Dataset Domains and Dataset Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/howitworks-domains-ds-types.html).



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::Tag>]

The optional metadata that you apply to the dataset to help you
categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

=over

=item *

Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

=item *

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.

=item *

Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @.

=item *

Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

=item *

Do not use C<aws:>, C<AWS:>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
have this prefix. If a tag value has C<aws> as its prefix but the key
does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count
against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of C<aws>
do not count against your tags per resource limit.
