=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeName => $value, ..., Condition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::TimeSeriesCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Creates a subset of items within an attribute that are modified. For
example, you can use this operation to create a subset of items that
cost $5 or less. To do this, you specify C<"AttributeName": "price">,
C<"AttributeValue": "5">, and C<"Condition": "LESS_THAN">. Pair this
operation with the Action operation within the
CreateWhatIfForecastRequest$TimeSeriesTransformations operation to
define how the attribute is modified.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeName => Str
