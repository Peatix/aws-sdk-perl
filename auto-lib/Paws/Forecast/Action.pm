=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::Action

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::Action object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeName => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::Action object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the modifications that you are making to an attribute for a
what-if forecast. For example, you can use this operation to create a
what-if forecast that investigates a 10% off sale on all shoes. To do
this, you specify C<"AttributeName": "shoes">, C<"Operation":
"MULTIPLY">, and C<"Value": "0.90">. Pair this operation with the
TimeSeriesCondition operation within the
CreateWhatIfForecastRequest$TimeSeriesTransformations operation to
define a subset of attribute items that are modified.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeName => Str

The related time series that you are modifying. This value is case
insensitive.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operation => Str

The operation that is applied to the provided attribute. Operations
include:

=over

=item *

C<ADD> - adds C<Value> to all rows of C<AttributeName>.

=item *

C<SUBTRACT> - subtracts C<Value> from all rows of C<AttributeName>.

=item *

C<MULTIPLY> - multiplies all rows of C<AttributeName> by C<Value>.

=item *

C<DIVIDE> - divides all rows of C<AttributeName> by C<Value>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Num

The value that is applied for the chosen C<Operation>.
