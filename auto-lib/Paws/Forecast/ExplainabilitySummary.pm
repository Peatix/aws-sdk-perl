=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilitySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilitySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilitySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a summary of the Explainability properties used in the
ListExplainabilities operation. To get a complete set of properties,
call the DescribeExplainability operation, and provide the listed
C<ExplainabilityArn>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

When the Explainability was created.


=head2 ExplainabilityArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Explainability.


=head2 ExplainabilityConfig => L<Paws::Forecast::ExplainabilityConfig>

The configuration settings that define the granularity of time series
and time points for the Explainability.


=head2 ExplainabilityName => Str

The name of the Explainability.


=head2 LastModificationTime => Str

The last time the resource was modified. The timestamp depends on the
status of the job:

=over

=item *

C<CREATE_PENDING> - The C<CreationTime>.

=item *

C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS> - The current timestamp.

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPING> - The current timestamp.

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPED> - When the job stopped.

=item *

C<ACTIVE> or C<CREATE_FAILED> - When the job finished or failed.

=back



=head2 Message => Str

Information about any errors that may have occurred during the
Explainability creation process.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Predictor or Forecast used to
create the Explainability.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the Explainability. States include:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE>

=item *

C<CREATE_PENDING>, C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS>, C<CREATE_FAILED>

=item *

C<CREATE_STOPPING>, C<CREATE_STOPPED>

=item *
