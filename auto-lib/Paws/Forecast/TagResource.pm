=head1 NAME

Paws::Forecast::TagResource - Arguments for method TagResource on L<Paws::Forecast>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method TagResource on the
L<Amazon Forecast Service|Paws::Forecast> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method TagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to TagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $forecast = Paws->service('Forecast');
    my $TagResourceResponse = $forecast->TagResource(
      ResourceArn => 'MyArn',
      Tags        => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/forecast/TagResource>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the resource for which
to list the tags.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Forecast::Tag>]

The tags to add to the resource. A tag is an array of key-value pairs.

The following basic restrictions apply to tags:

=over

=item *

Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.

=item *

For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
have only one value.

=item *

Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.

=item *

If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources,
remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed
characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and
spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @.

=item *

Tag keys and values are case sensitive.

=item *

Do not use C<aws:>, C<AWS:>, or any upper or lowercase combination of
such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services
use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can
have this prefix. If a tag value has C<aws> as its prefix but the key
does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count
against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of C<aws>
do not count against your tags per resource limit.
