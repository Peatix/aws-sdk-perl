=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::SupportedInstanceType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::SupportedInstanceType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Architecture => $value, ..., VCPU => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::SupportedInstanceType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Architecture

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An instance type that the specified Amazon EMR release supports.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Architecture => Str

The CPU architecture, for example C<X86_64> or C<AARCH64>.


=head2 EbsOptimizedAvailable => Bool

Indicates whether the C<SupportedInstanceType> supports Amazon EBS
optimization.


=head2 EbsOptimizedByDefault => Bool

Indicates whether the C<SupportedInstanceType> uses Amazon EBS
optimization by default.


=head2 EbsStorageOnly => Bool

Indicates whether the C<SupportedInstanceType> only supports Amazon
EBS.


=head2 InstanceFamilyId => Str

The Amazon EC2 family and generation for the C<SupportedInstanceType>.


=head2 Is64BitsOnly => Bool

Indicates whether the C<SupportedInstanceType> only supports 64-bit
architecture.


=head2 MemoryGB => Num

The amount of memory that is available to Amazon EMR from the
C<SupportedInstanceType>. The kernel and hypervisor software consume
some memory, so this value might be lower than the overall memory for
the instance type.


=head2 NumberOfDisks => Int

Number of disks for the C<SupportedInstanceType>. This value is C<0>
for Amazon EBS-only instance types.


=head2 StorageGB => Int

C<StorageGB> represents the storage capacity of the
C<SupportedInstanceType>. This value is C<0> for Amazon EBS-only
instance types.


=head2 Type => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type
(http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), for example C<m5.xlarge>,
of the C<SupportedInstanceType>.


=head2 VCPU => Int

The number of vCPUs available for the C<SupportedInstanceType>.
