=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::ManagedScalingPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::ManagedScalingPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeLimits => $value, ..., UtilizationPerformanceIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::ManagedScalingPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeLimits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Managed scaling policy for an Amazon EMR cluster. The policy specifies
the limits for resources that can be added or terminated from a
cluster. The policy only applies to the core and task nodes. The master
node cannot be scaled after initial configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeLimits => L<Paws::EMR::ComputeLimits>

The Amazon EC2 unit limits for a managed scaling policy. The managed
scaling activity of a cluster is not allowed to go above or below these
limits. The limit only applies to the core and task nodes. The master
node cannot be scaled after initial configuration.


=head2 ScalingStrategy => Str

Determines whether a custom scaling utilization performance index can
be set. Possible values include I<ADVANCED> or I<DEFAULT>.


=head2 UtilizationPerformanceIndex => Int

An integer value that represents an advanced scaling strategy. Setting
a higher value optimizes for performance. Setting a lower value
optimizes for resource conservation. Setting the value to 50 balances
performance and resource conservation. Possible values are 1, 25, 50,
75, and 100.
