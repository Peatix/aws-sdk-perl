=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::OnDemandResizingSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::OnDemandResizingSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., TimeoutDurationMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::OnDemandResizingSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The resize specification for On-Demand Instances in the instance fleet,
which contains the resize timeout period.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

Specifies the allocation strategy to use to launch On-Demand instances
during a resize. The default is C<lowest-price>.


=head2 CapacityReservationOptions => L<Paws::EMR::OnDemandCapacityReservationOptions>




=head2 TimeoutDurationMinutes => Int

On-Demand resize timeout in minutes. If On-Demand Instances are not
provisioned within this time, the resize workflow stops. The minimum
value is 5 minutes, and the maximum value is 10,080 minutes (7 days).
The timeout applies to all resize workflows on the Instance Fleet. The
resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR Managed Scaling or by the
customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR CLI modify-instance-fleet
or Amazon EMR SDK ModifyInstanceFleet API) or by Amazon EMR due to
Amazon EC2 Spot Reclamation.
