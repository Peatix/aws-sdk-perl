=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::InstanceTypeSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::InstanceTypeSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BidPrice => $value, ..., WeightedCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::InstanceTypeSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BidPrice

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration specification for each instance type in an instance
fleet.

The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR
releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BidPrice => Str

The bid price for each Amazon EC2 Spot Instance type as defined by
C<InstanceType>. Expressed in USD.


=head2 BidPriceAsPercentageOfOnDemandPrice => Num

The bid price, as a percentage of On-Demand price, for each Amazon EC2
Spot Instance as defined by C<InstanceType>. Expressed as a number (for
example, 20 specifies 20%).


=head2 Configurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EMR::Configuration>]

A configuration classification that applies when provisioning cluster
instances, which can include configurations for applications and
software bundled with Amazon EMR.


=head2 CustomAmiId => Str

The custom AMI ID to use for the instance type.


=head2 EbsBlockDevices => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EMR::EbsBlockDevice>]

The configuration of Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) attached
to each instance as defined by C<InstanceType>.


=head2 EbsOptimized => Bool

Evaluates to C<TRUE> when the specified C<InstanceType> is
EBS-optimized.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type, for example C<m3.xlarge>.


=head2 Priority => Num

The priority at which Amazon EMR launches the Amazon EC2 instances with
this instance type. Priority starts at 0, which is the highest
priority. Amazon EMR considers the highest priority first.


=head2 WeightedCapacity => Int

The number of units that a provisioned instance of this type provides
toward fulfilling the target capacities defined in InstanceFleetConfig.
Capacity values represent performance characteristics such as vCPUs,
memory, or I/O. If not specified, the default value is 1.
