This class represents the parameters used for calling the method RemoveManagedScalingPolicy on the
L<Amazon EMR|Paws::EMR> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method RemoveManagedScalingPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $elasticmapreduce = Paws->service('EMR');
    my $RemoveManagedScalingPolicyOutput =
      $elasticmapreduce->RemoveManagedScalingPolicy(

      );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
