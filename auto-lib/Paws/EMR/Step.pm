=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::Step

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::Step object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionOnFailure => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::Step object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionOnFailure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This represents a step in a cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActionOnFailure => Str

The action to take when the cluster step fails. Possible values are
C<TERMINATE_CLUSTER>, C<CANCEL_AND_WAIT>, and C<CONTINUE>.
C<TERMINATE_JOB_FLOW> is provided for backward compatibility. We
recommend using C<TERMINATE_CLUSTER> instead.

If a cluster's C<StepConcurrencyLevel> is greater than C<1>, do not use
C<AddJobFlowSteps> to submit a step with this parameter set to
C<CANCEL_AND_WAIT> or C<TERMINATE_CLUSTER>. The step is not submitted
and the action fails with a message that the C<ActionOnFailure> setting
is not valid.

If you change a cluster's C<StepConcurrencyLevel> to be greater than 1
while a step is running, the C<ActionOnFailure> parameter may not
behave as you expect. In this case, for a step that fails with this
parameter set to C<CANCEL_AND_WAIT>, pending steps and the running step
are not canceled; for a step that fails with this parameter set to
C<TERMINATE_CLUSTER>, the cluster does not terminate.


=head2 Config => L<Paws::EMR::HadoopStepConfig>

The Hadoop job configuration of the cluster step.


=head2 ExecutionRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the runtime role for a step on the
cluster. The runtime role can be a cross-account IAM role. The runtime
role ARN is a combination of account ID, role name, and role type using
the following format: C<arn:partition:service:region:account:resource>.

For example, C<arn:aws:IAM::1234567890:role/ReadOnly> is a correctly
formatted runtime role ARN.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier of the cluster step.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the cluster step.


=head2 Status => L<Paws::EMR::StepStatus>

The current execution status details of the cluster step.
