=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingPolicy => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::InstanceGroupConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration defining a new instance group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingPolicy => L<Paws::EMR::AutoScalingPolicy>

An automatic scaling policy for a core instance group or task instance
group in an Amazon EMR cluster. The automatic scaling policy defines
how an instance group dynamically adds and terminates Amazon EC2
instances in response to the value of a CloudWatch metric. See
PutAutoScalingPolicy.


=head2 BidPrice => Str

If specified, indicates that the instance group uses Spot Instances.
This is the maximum price you are willing to pay for Spot Instances.
Specify C<OnDemandPrice> to set the amount equal to the On-Demand
price, or specify an amount in USD.


=head2 Configurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EMR::Configuration>]

Amazon EMR releases 4.x or later.

The list of configurations supplied for an Amazon EMR cluster instance
group. You can specify a separate configuration for each instance group
(master, core, and task).


=head2 CustomAmiId => Str

The custom AMI ID to use for the provisioned instance group.


=head2 EbsConfiguration => L<Paws::EMR::EbsConfiguration>

EBS configurations that will be attached to each Amazon EC2 instance in
the instance group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceCount => Int

Target number of instances for the instance group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceRole => Str

The role of the instance group in the cluster.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type for all instances in the instance group.


=head2 Market => Str

Market type of the Amazon EC2 instances used to create a cluster node.


=head2 Name => Str

Friendly name given to the instance group.
