=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::UpdateStudio - Arguments for method UpdateStudio on L<Paws::EMR>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateStudio on the
L<Amazon EMR|Paws::EMR> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateStudio.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateStudio.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $elasticmapreduce = Paws->service('EMR');
    $elasticmapreduce->UpdateStudio(
      StudioId          => 'MyXmlStringMaxLen256',
      DefaultS3Location => 'MyXmlString',             # OPTIONAL
      Description       => 'MyXmlStringMaxLen256',    # OPTIONAL
      EncryptionKeyArn  => 'MyXmlString',             # OPTIONAL
      Name              => 'MyXmlStringMaxLen256',    # OPTIONAL
      SubnetIds         => [ 'MyString', ... ],       # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticmapreduce/UpdateStudio>
