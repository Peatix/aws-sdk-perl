=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::SpotResizingSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::SpotResizingSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., TimeoutDurationMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::SpotResizingSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The resize specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet,
which contains the resize timeout period.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

Specifies the allocation strategy to use to launch Spot instances
during a resize. If you run Amazon EMR releases 6.9.0 or higher, the
default is C<price-capacity-optimized>. If you run Amazon EMR releases
6.8.0 or lower, the default is C<capacity-optimized>.


=head2 TimeoutDurationMinutes => Int

Spot resize timeout in minutes. If Spot Instances are not provisioned
within this time, the resize workflow will stop provisioning of Spot
instances. Minimum value is 5 minutes and maximum value is 10,080
minutes (7 days). The timeout applies to all resize workflows on the
Instance Fleet. The resize could be triggered by Amazon EMR Managed
Scaling or by the customer (via Amazon EMR Console, Amazon EMR CLI
modify-instance-fleet or Amazon EMR SDK ModifyInstanceFleet API) or by
Amazon EMR due to Amazon EC2 Spot Reclamation.
