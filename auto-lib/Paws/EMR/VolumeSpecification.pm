=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::VolumeSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::VolumeSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Iops => $value, ..., VolumeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::VolumeSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Iops

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EBS volume specifications such as volume type, IOPS, size (GiB) and
throughput (MiB/s) that are requested for the EBS volume attached to an
Amazon EC2 instance in the cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Iops => Int

The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume
supports.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SizeInGB => Int

The volume size, in gibibytes (GiB). This can be a number from 1 -
1024. If the volume type is EBS-optimized, the minimum value is 10.


=head2 Throughput => Int

The throughput, in mebibyte per second (MiB/s). This optional parameter
can be a number from 125 - 1000 and is valid only for gp3 volumes.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeType => Str

The volume type. Volume types supported are gp3, gp2, io1, st1, sc1,
and standard.
