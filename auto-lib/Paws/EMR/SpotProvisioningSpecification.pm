=head1 NAME

Paws::EMR::SpotProvisioningSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMR::SpotProvisioningSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., TimeoutDurationMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMR::SpotProvisioningSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The launch specification for Spot Instances in the instance fleet,
which determines the defined duration, provisioning timeout behavior,
and allocation strategy.

The instance fleet configuration is available only in Amazon EMR
releases 4.8.0 and later, excluding 5.0.x versions. Spot Instance
allocation strategy is available in Amazon EMR releases 5.12.1 and
later.

Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are
no longer available to new customers from July 1, 2021. For customers
who have previously used the feature, we will continue to support Spot
Instances with a defined duration until December 31, 2022.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

Specifies one of the following strategies to launch Spot Instance
fleets: C<capacity-optimized>, C<price-capacity-optimized>,
C<lowest-price>, or C<diversified>, and
C<capacity-optimized-prioritized>. For more information on the
provisioning strategies, see Allocation strategies for Spot Instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-fleet-allocation-strategy.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.

When you launch a Spot Instance fleet with the old console, it
automatically launches with the C<capacity-optimized> strategy. You
can't change the allocation strategy from the old console.


=head2 BlockDurationMinutes => Int

The defined duration for Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks) in
minutes. When specified, the Spot Instance does not terminate before
the defined duration expires, and defined duration pricing for Spot
Instances applies. Valid values are 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360. The
duration period starts as soon as a Spot Instance receives its instance
ID. At the end of the duration, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot Instance for
termination and provides a Spot Instance termination notice, which
gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.

Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are
no longer available to new customers from July 1, 2021. For customers
who have previously used the feature, we will continue to support Spot
Instances with a defined duration until December 31, 2022.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeoutAction => Str

The action to take when C<TargetSpotCapacity> has not been fulfilled
when the C<TimeoutDurationMinutes> has expired; that is, when all Spot
Instances could not be provisioned within the Spot provisioning
timeout. Valid values are C<TERMINATE_CLUSTER> and
C<SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND>. SWITCH_TO_ON_DEMAND specifies that if no Spot
Instances are available, On-Demand Instances should be provisioned to
fulfill any remaining Spot capacity.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeoutDurationMinutes => Int

The Spot provisioning timeout period in minutes. If Spot Instances are
not provisioned within this time period, the C<TimeOutAction> is taken.
Minimum value is 5 and maximum value is 1440. The timeout applies only
during initial provisioning, when the cluster is first created.
