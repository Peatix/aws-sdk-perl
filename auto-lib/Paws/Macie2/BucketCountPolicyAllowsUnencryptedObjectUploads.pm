=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::BucketCountPolicyAllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::BucketCountPolicyAllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads => $value, ..., Unknown => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::BucketCountPolicyAllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the number of S3 buckets whose bucket
policies do or don't require server-side encryption of objects when
objects are added to the buckets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads => Int

The total number of buckets that don't have a bucket policy or have a
bucket policy that doesn't require server-side encryption of new
objects. If a bucket policy exists, the policy doesn't require
PutObject requests to include a valid server-side encryption header:
the x-amz-server-side-encryption header with a value of AES256 or
aws:kms, or the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header
with a value of AES256.


=head2 DeniesUnencryptedObjectUploads => Int

The total number of buckets whose bucket policies require server-side
encryption of new objects. PutObject requests for these buckets must
include a valid server-side encryption header: the
x-amz-server-side-encryption header with a value of AES256 or aws:kms,
or the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header with a
value of AES256.


=head2 Unknown => Int

The total number of buckets that Amazon Macie wasn't able to evaluate
server-side encryption requirements for. For example, the buckets'
permissions settings or a quota prevented Macie from retrieving the
requisite data. Macie can't determine whether bucket policies for the
buckets require server-side encryption of new objects.
