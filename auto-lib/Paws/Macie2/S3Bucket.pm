=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::S3Bucket

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::S3Bucket object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::S3Bucket object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the S3 bucket that a finding applies to. If
a quota prevented Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing all the
bucket's information prior to generating the finding, the following
values are UNKNOWN or null: allowsUnencryptedObjectUploads,
defaultServerSideEncryption, publicAccess, and tags.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowsUnencryptedObjectUploads => Str

Specifies whether the bucket policy for the bucket requires server-side
encryption of objects when objects are added to the bucket. Possible
values are:

=over

=item *

FALSE - The bucket policy requires server-side encryption of new
objects. PutObject requests must include a valid server-side encryption
header.

=item *

TRUE - The bucket doesn't have a bucket policy or it has a bucket
policy that doesn't require server-side encryption of new objects. If a
bucket policy exists, it doesn't require PutObject requests to include
a valid server-side encryption header.

=item *

UNKNOWN - Amazon Macie can't determine whether the bucket policy
requires server-side encryption of new objects.

=back

Valid server-side encryption headers are: x-amz-server-side-encryption
with a value of AES256 or aws:kms, and
x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm with a value of AES256.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when the bucket
was created. This value can also indicate when changes such as edits to
the bucket's policy were most recently made to the bucket, relative to
when the finding was created or last updated.


=head2 DefaultServerSideEncryption => L<Paws::Macie2::ServerSideEncryption>

The default server-side encryption settings for the bucket.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the bucket.


=head2 Owner => L<Paws::Macie2::S3BucketOwner>

The display name and canonical user ID for the Amazon Web Services
account that owns the bucket.


=head2 PublicAccess => L<Paws::Macie2::BucketPublicAccess>

The permissions settings that determine whether the bucket is publicly
accessible.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Macie2::KeyValuePair>]

The tags that are associated with the bucket.
