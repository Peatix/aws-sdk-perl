  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Sensitive => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::ResourceProfileArtifact object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClassificationResultStatus => Str

The status of the analysis. Possible values are:
