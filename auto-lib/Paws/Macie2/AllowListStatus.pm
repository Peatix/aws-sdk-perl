=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::AllowListStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::AllowListStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., Description => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::AllowListStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the current status of an allow list, which
indicates whether Amazon Macie can access and use the list's criteria.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Code => Str

The current status of the allow list. If the list's criteria specify a
regular expression (regex), this value is typically OK. Amazon Macie
can compile the expression.

If the list's criteria specify an S3 object, possible values are:

=over

=item *

OK - Macie can retrieve and parse the contents of the object.

=item *

S3_OBJECT_ACCESS_DENIED - Macie isn't allowed to access the object or
the object is encrypted with a customer managed KMS key that Macie
isn't allowed to use. Check the bucket policy and other permissions
settings for the bucket and the object. If the object is encrypted,
also ensure that it's encrypted with a key that Macie is allowed to
use.

=item *

S3_OBJECT_EMPTY - Macie can retrieve the object but the object doesn't
contain any content. Ensure that the object contains the correct
entries. Also ensure that the list's criteria specify the correct
bucket and object names.

=item *

S3_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND - The object doesn't exist in Amazon S3. Ensure
that the list's criteria specify the correct bucket and object names.

=item *

S3_OBJECT_OVERSIZE - Macie can retrieve the object. However, the object
contains too many entries or its storage size exceeds the quota for an
allow list. Try breaking the list into multiple files and ensure that
each file doesn't exceed any quotas. Then configure list settings in
Macie for each file.

=item *

S3_THROTTLED - Amazon S3 throttled the request to retrieve the object.
Wait a few minutes and then try again.

=item *

S3_USER_ACCESS_DENIED - Amazon S3 denied the request to retrieve the
object. If the specified object exists, you're not allowed to access it
or it's encrypted with an KMS key that you're not allowed to use. Work
with your Amazon Web Services administrator to ensure that the list's
criteria specify the correct bucket and object names, and you have read
access to the bucket and the object. If the object is encrypted, also
ensure that it's encrypted with a key that you're allowed to use.

=item *

UNKNOWN_ERROR - A transient or internal error occurred when Macie
attempted to retrieve or parse the object. Wait a few minutes and then
try again. A list can also have this status if it's encrypted with a
key that Amazon S3 and Macie can't access or use.

=back



=head2 Description => Str

A brief description of the status of the allow list. Amazon Macie uses
this value to provide additional information about an error that
occurred when Macie tried to access and use the list's criteria.
