=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::BucketCountByEncryptionType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::BucketCountByEncryptionType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsManaged => $value, ..., Unknown => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::BucketCountByEncryptionType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsManaged

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the number of S3 buckets whose settings do
or don't specify default server-side encryption behavior for objects
that are added to the buckets. For detailed information about these
settings, see Setting default server-side encryption behavior for
Amazon S3 buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsManaged => Int

The total number of buckets whose default encryption settings are
configured to encrypt new objects with an KMS key, either an Amazon Web
Services managed key or a customer managed key. By default, these
buckets encrypt new objects automatically using DSSE-KMS or SSE-KMS
encryption.


=head2 S3Managed => Int

The total number of buckets whose default encryption settings are
configured to encrypt new objects with an Amazon S3 managed key. By
default, these buckets encrypt new objects automatically using SSE-S3
encryption.


=head2 Unencrypted => Int

The total number of buckets that don't specify default server-side
encryption behavior for new objects. Default encryption settings aren't
configured for these buckets.


=head2 Unknown => Int

The total number of buckets that Amazon Macie doesn't have current
encryption metadata for. For example, the buckets' permissions settings
or a quota prevented Macie from retrieving the default encryption
settings for the buckets.
