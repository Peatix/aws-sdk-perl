=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::RevealConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::RevealConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyId => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::RevealConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the status of the Amazon Macie configuration for retrieving
occurrences of sensitive data reported by findings, and the Key
Management Service (KMS) key to use to encrypt sensitive data that's
retrieved. When you enable the configuration for the first time, your
request must specify an KMS key. Otherwise, an error occurs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN), ID, or alias of the KMS key to use to
encrypt sensitive data that's retrieved. The key must be an existing,
customer managed, symmetric encryption key that's enabled in the same
Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon Macie account.

If this value specifies an alias, it must include the following prefix:
alias/. If this value specifies a key that's owned by another Amazon
Web Services account, it must specify the ARN of the key or the ARN of
the key's alias.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of the configuration for the Amazon Macie account. In a
response, possible values are: ENABLED, the configuration is currently
enabled for the account; and, DISABLED, the configuration is currently
disabled for the account. In a request, valid values are: ENABLED,
enable the configuration for the account; and, DISABLED, disable the
configuration for the account.

If you disable the configuration, you also permanently delete current
settings that specify how to access affected S3 objects. If your
current access method is ASSUME_ROLE, Macie also deletes the external
ID and role name currently specified for the configuration. These
settings can't be recovered after they're deleted.
