=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the number of S3 buckets that are or aren't
shared with other Amazon Web Services accounts, Amazon CloudFront
origin access identities (OAIs), or CloudFront origin access controls
(OACs). In this data, an I<Amazon Macie organization> is defined as a
set of Macie accounts that are centrally managed as a group of related
accounts through Organizations or by Macie invitation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 External => Int

The total number of buckets that are shared with one or more of the
following or any combination of the following: an Amazon CloudFront
OAI, a CloudFront OAC, or an Amazon Web Services account that isn't in
the same Amazon Macie organization.


=head2 Internal => Int

The total number of buckets that are shared with one or more Amazon Web
Services accounts in the same Amazon Macie organization. These buckets
aren't shared with Amazon CloudFront OAIs or OACs.


=head2 NotShared => Int

The total number of buckets that aren't shared with other Amazon Web
Services accounts, Amazon CloudFront OAIs, or CloudFront OACs.


=head2 Unknown => Int

The total number of buckets that Amazon Macie wasn't able to evaluate
shared access settings for. For example, the buckets' permissions
settings or a quota prevented Macie from retrieving the requisite data.
Macie can't determine whether the buckets are shared with other Amazon
Web Services accounts, Amazon CloudFront OAIs, or CloudFront OACs.
