=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::ResourceStatistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::ResourceStatistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TotalBytesClassified => $value, ..., TotalItemsSkippedPermissionDenied => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::ResourceStatistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TotalBytesClassified

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides statistical data for sensitive data discovery metrics that
apply to an S3 bucket that Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for an
account, if automated sensitive data discovery has been enabled for the
account. The data captures the results of automated sensitive data
discovery activities that Macie has performed for the bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TotalBytesClassified => Int

The total amount of data, in bytes, that Amazon Macie has analyzed in
the bucket.


=head2 TotalDetections => Int

The total number of occurrences of sensitive data that Amazon Macie has
found in the bucket's objects. This includes occurrences that are
currently suppressed by the sensitivity scoring settings for the bucket
(totalDetectionsSuppressed).


=head2 TotalDetectionsSuppressed => Int

The total number of occurrences of sensitive data that are currently
suppressed by the sensitivity scoring settings for the bucket. These
represent occurrences of sensitive data that Amazon Macie found in the
bucket's objects, but the occurrences were manually suppressed. By
default, suppressed occurrences are excluded from the bucket's
sensitivity score.


=head2 TotalItemsClassified => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie has analyzed in the
bucket.


=head2 TotalItemsSensitive => Int

The total number of the bucket's objects that Amazon Macie has found
sensitive data in.


=head2 TotalItemsSkipped => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie wasn't able to analyze in
the bucket due to an object-level issue or error. For example, an
object is a malformed file. This value includes objects that Macie
wasn't able to analyze for reasons reported by other statistics in the
ResourceStatistics object.


=head2 TotalItemsSkippedInvalidEncryption => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie wasn't able to analyze in
the bucket because the objects are encrypted with a key that Macie
can't access. The objects use server-side encryption with
customer-provided keys (SSE-C).


=head2 TotalItemsSkippedInvalidKms => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie wasn't able to analyze in
the bucket because the objects are encrypted with KMS keys that were
disabled, are scheduled for deletion, or were deleted.


=head2 TotalItemsSkippedPermissionDenied => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie wasn't able to analyze in
the bucket due to the permissions settings for the objects or the
permissions settings for the keys that were used to encrypt the
objects.
