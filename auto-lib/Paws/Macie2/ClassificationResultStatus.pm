=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::ClassificationResultStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::ClassificationResultStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., Reason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::ClassificationResultStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the status of a sensitive data finding.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Code => Str

The status of the finding. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

COMPLETE - Amazon Macie successfully completed its analysis of the S3
object that the finding applies to.

=item *

PARTIAL - Macie analyzed only a subset of the data in the S3 object
that the finding applies to. For example, the object is an archive file
that contains files in an unsupported format.

=item *

SKIPPED - Macie wasn't able to analyze the S3 object that the finding
applies to. For example, the object is a file that uses an unsupported
format.

=back



=head2 Reason => Str

A brief description of the status of the finding. This value is null if
the status (code) of the finding is COMPLETE.

Amazon Macie uses this value to notify you of any errors, warnings, or
considerations that might impact your analysis of the finding and the
affected S3 object. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

ARCHIVE_CONTAINS_UNPROCESSED_FILES - The object is an archive file and
Macie extracted and analyzed only some or none of the files in the
archive. To determine which files Macie analyzed, if any, refer to the
corresponding sensitive data discovery result for the finding
(classificationDetails.detailedResultsLocation).

=item *

ARCHIVE_EXCEEDS_SIZE_LIMIT - The object is an archive file whose total
storage size exceeds the size quota for this type of archive.

=item *

ARCHIVE_NESTING_LEVEL_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an archive file whose
nested depth exceeds the quota for the maximum number of nested levels
that Macie analyzes for this type of archive.

=item *

ARCHIVE_TOTAL_BYTES_EXTRACTED_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an archive
file that exceeds the quota for the maximum amount of data that Macie
extracts and analyzes for this type of archive.

=item *

ARCHIVE_TOTAL_DOCUMENTS_PROCESSED_OVER_LIMIT - The object is an archive
file that contains more than the maximum number of files that Macie
extracts and analyzes for this type of archive.

=item *

FILE_EXCEEDS_SIZE_LIMIT - The storage size of the object exceeds the
size quota for this type of file.

=item *

INVALID_ENCRYPTION - The object is encrypted using server-side
encryption but Macie isn't allowed to use the key. Macie can't decrypt
and analyze the object.

=item *

INVALID_KMS_KEY - The object is encrypted with an KMS key that was
disabled or is being deleted. Macie can't decrypt and analyze the
object.

=item *

INVALID_OBJECT_STATE - The object doesn't use a supported Amazon S3
storage class.

=item *

JSON_NESTING_LEVEL_OVER_LIMIT - The object contains JSON data and the
nested depth of the data exceeds the quota for the number of nested
levels that Macie analyzes for this type of file.

=item *

MALFORMED_FILE - The object is a malformed or corrupted file. An error
occurred when Macie attempted to detect the file's type or extract data
from the file.

=item *

MALFORMED_OR_FILE_SIZE_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is a Microsoft Office
file that is malformed or exceeds the size quota for this type of file.
If the file is malformed, an error occurred when Macie attempted to
extract data from the file.

=item *

NO_SUCH_BUCKET_AVAILABLE - The object was in a bucket that was deleted
shortly before or when Macie attempted to analyze the object.

=item *

OBJECT_VERSION_MISMATCH - The object was changed while Macie was
analyzing it.

=item *

OOXML_UNCOMPRESSED_RATIO_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is an Office Open
XML file whose compression ratio exceeds the compression quota for this
type of file.

=item *

OOXML_UNCOMPRESSED_SIZE_EXCEEDS_LIMIT - The object is an Office Open
XML file that exceeds the size quota for this type of file.

=item *

PERMISSION_DENIED - Macie isn't allowed to access the object. The
object's permissions settings prevent Macie from analyzing the object.

=item *

SOURCE_OBJECT_NO_LONGER_AVAILABLE - The object was deleted shortly
before or when Macie attempted to analyze it.

=item *

TIME_CUT_OFF_REACHED - Macie started analyzing the object but
additional analysis would exceed the time quota for analyzing an
object.

=item *

UNABLE_TO_PARSE_FILE - The object is a file that contains structured
data and an error occurred when Macie attempted to parse the data.

=item *

UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE_EXCEPTION - The object is a file that uses an
