=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::SensitivityInspectionTemplateIncludes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::SensitivityInspectionTemplateIncludes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowListIds => $value, ..., ManagedDataIdentifierIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::SensitivityInspectionTemplateIncludes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowListIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the allow lists, custom data identifiers, and managed data
identifiers to include (use) when performing automated sensitive data
discovery. The configuration must specify at least one custom data
identifier or managed data identifier. For information about the
managed data identifiers that Amazon Macie currently provides, see
Using managed data identifiers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/managed-data-identifiers.html)
in the I<Amazon Macie User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowListIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of unique identifiers, one for each allow list to include.


=head2 CustomDataIdentifierIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of unique identifiers, one for each custom data identifier to
include.


=head2 ManagedDataIdentifierIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of unique identifiers, one for each managed data identifier to
include.

Amazon Macie uses these managed data identifiers in addition to managed
data identifiers that are subsequently released and recommended for
automated sensitive data discovery. To retrieve a list of valid values
for the managed data identifiers that are currently available, use the
ListManagedDataIdentifiers operation.
