=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::S3ClassificationScopeExclusionUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::S3ClassificationScopeExclusionUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BucketNames => $value, ..., Operation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::S3ClassificationScopeExclusionUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BucketNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies S3 buckets to add or remove from the exclusion list defined
by the classification scope for an Amazon Macie account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BucketNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Depending on the value specified for the update operation
(ClassificationScopeUpdateOperation), an array of strings that: lists
the names of buckets to add or remove from the list, or specifies a new
set of bucket names that overwrites all existing names in the list.
Each string must be the full name of an existing S3 bucket. Values are
case sensitive.
