=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::MatchingBucket

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::MatchingBucket object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., UnclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::MatchingBucket object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides statistical data and other information about an S3 bucket that
Amazon Macie monitors and analyzes for your account. By default, object
count and storage size values include data for object parts that are
the result of incomplete multipart uploads. For more information, see
How Macie monitors Amazon S3 data security
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/monitoring-s3-how-it-works.html)
in the I<Amazon Macie User Guide>.

If an error or issue prevents Macie from retrieving and processing
information about the bucket or the bucket's objects, the value for
many of these properties is null. Key exceptions are accountId and
bucketName. To identify the cause, refer to the errorCode and
errorMessage values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The unique identifier for the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
bucket.


=head2 AutomatedDiscoveryMonitoringStatus => Str

Specifies whether automated sensitive data discovery is currently
configured to analyze objects in the bucket. Possible values are:
MONITORED, the bucket is included in analyses; and, NOT_MONITORED, the
bucket is excluded from analyses. If automated sensitive data discovery
is disabled for your account, this value is NOT_MONITORED.


=head2 BucketName => Str

The name of the bucket.


=head2 ClassifiableObjectCount => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can analyze in the
bucket. These objects use a supported storage class and have a file
name extension for a supported file or storage format.


=head2 ClassifiableSizeInBytes => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that Amazon Macie can
analyze in the bucket. These objects use a supported storage class and
have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Macie calculates this value
based on the size of the latest version of each applicable object in
the bucket. This value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions
of each applicable object in the bucket.


=head2 ErrorCode => Str

The code for an error or issue that prevented Amazon Macie from
retrieving and processing information about the bucket and the bucket's
objects. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

ACCESS_DENIED - Macie doesn't have permission to retrieve the
information. For example, the bucket has a restrictive bucket policy
and Amazon S3 denied the request.

=item *

BUCKET_COUNT_EXCEEDS_QUOTA - Retrieving and processing the information
would exceed the quota for the number of buckets that Macie monitors
for an account (10,000).

=back

If this value is null, Macie was able to retrieve and process the
information.


=head2 ErrorMessage => Str

A brief description of the error or issue (errorCode) that prevented
Amazon Macie from retrieving and processing information about the
bucket and the bucket's objects. This value is null if Macie was able
to retrieve and process the information.


=head2 JobDetails => L<Paws::Macie2::JobDetails>

Specifies whether any one-time or recurring classification jobs are
configured to analyze objects in the bucket, and, if so, the details of
the job that ran most recently.


=head2 LastAutomatedDiscoveryTime => Str

The date and time, in UTC and extended ISO 8601 format, when Amazon
Macie most recently analyzed objects in the bucket while performing
automated sensitive data discovery. This value is null if this analysis
hasn't occurred.


=head2 ObjectCount => Int

The total number of objects in the bucket.


=head2 ObjectCountByEncryptionType => L<Paws::Macie2::ObjectCountByEncryptionType>

The total number of objects in the bucket, grouped by server-side
encryption type. This includes a grouping that reports the total number
of objects that aren't encrypted or use client-side encryption.


=head2 SensitivityScore => Int

The sensitivity score for the bucket, ranging from -1 (classification
error) to 100 (sensitive).

If automated sensitive data discovery has never been enabled for your
account or it's been disabled for your organization or standalone
account for more than 30 days, possible values are: 1, the bucket is
empty; or, 50, the bucket stores objects but it's been excluded from
recent analyses.


=head2 SizeInBytes => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of the bucket.

If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Amazon Macie calculates this
value based on the size of the latest version of each object in the
bucket. This value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of
each object in the bucket.


=head2 SizeInBytesCompressed => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that are compressed
(.gz, .gzip, .zip) files in the bucket.

If versioning is enabled for the bucket, Amazon Macie calculates this
value based on the size of the latest version of each applicable object
in the bucket. This value doesn't reflect the storage size of all
versions of each applicable object in the bucket.


=head2 UnclassifiableObjectCount => L<Paws::Macie2::ObjectLevelStatistics>

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie can't analyze in the
bucket. These objects don't use a supported storage class or don't have
a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.


=head2 UnclassifiableObjectSizeInBytes => L<Paws::Macie2::ObjectLevelStatistics>

The total storage size, in bytes, of the objects that Amazon Macie
can't analyze in the bucket. These objects don't use a supported
storage class or don't have a file name extension for a supported file
or storage format.
