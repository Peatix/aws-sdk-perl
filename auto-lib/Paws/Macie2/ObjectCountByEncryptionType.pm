=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::ObjectCountByEncryptionType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::ObjectCountByEncryptionType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomerManaged => $value, ..., Unknown => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::ObjectCountByEncryptionType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomerManaged

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the number of objects that are in an S3
bucket and use certain types of server-side encryption, use client-side
encryption, or aren't encrypted.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomerManaged => Int

The total number of objects that are encrypted with customer-provided
keys. The objects use server-side encryption with customer-provided
keys (SSE-C).


=head2 KmsManaged => Int

The total number of objects that are encrypted with KMS keys, either
Amazon Web Services managed keys or customer managed keys. The objects
use dual-layer server-side encryption or server-side encryption with
KMS keys (DSSE-KMS or SSE-KMS).


=head2 S3Managed => Int

The total number of objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed
keys. The objects use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
keys (SSE-S3).


=head2 Unencrypted => Int

The total number of objects that use client-side encryption or aren't
encrypted.


=head2 Unknown => Int

The total number of objects that Amazon Macie doesn't have current
encryption metadata for. Macie can't provide current data about the
encryption settings for these objects.
