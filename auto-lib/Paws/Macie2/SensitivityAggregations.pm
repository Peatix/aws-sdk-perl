=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClassifiableSizeInBytes => $value, ..., TotalSizeInBytes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClassifiableSizeInBytes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides aggregated statistical data for sensitive data discovery
metrics that apply to S3 buckets. Each field contains aggregated data
for all the buckets that have a sensitivity score (sensitivityScore) of
a specified value or within a specified range
(BucketStatisticsBySensitivity). If automated sensitive data discovery
is currently disabled for your account, the value for most fields is 0.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClassifiableSizeInBytes => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of all the objects that Amazon Macie
can analyze in the buckets. These objects use a supported storage class
and have a file name extension for a supported file or storage format.

If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, this value is based on
the size of the latest version of each applicable object in the
buckets. This value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of
all applicable objects in the buckets.


=head2 PubliclyAccessibleCount => Int

The total number of buckets that are publicly accessible due to a
combination of permissions settings for each bucket.


=head2 TotalCount => Int

The total number of buckets.


=head2 TotalSizeInBytes => Int

The total storage size, in bytes, of the buckets.

If versioning is enabled for any of the buckets, this value is based on
the size of the latest version of each object in the buckets. This
value doesn't reflect the storage size of all versions of the objects
in the buckets.
