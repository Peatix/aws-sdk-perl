=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::RetrievalConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::RetrievalConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExternalId => $value, ..., RoleName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::RetrievalConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExternalId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the access method and settings that are used
to retrieve occurrences of sensitive data reported by findings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExternalId => Str

The external ID to specify in the trust policy for the IAM role to
assume when retrieving sensitive data from affected S3 objects
(roleName). This value is null if the value for retrievalMode is
CALLER_CREDENTIALS.

This ID is a unique alphanumeric string that Amazon Macie generates
automatically after you configure it to assume an IAM role. For a Macie
administrator to retrieve sensitive data from an affected S3 object for
a member account, the trust policy for the role in the member account
must include an sts:ExternalId condition that requires this ID.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RetrievalMode => Str

The access method that's used to retrieve sensitive data from affected
S3 objects. Valid values are: ASSUME_ROLE, assume an IAM role that is
in the affected Amazon Web Services account and delegates access to
Amazon Macie (roleName); and, CALLER_CREDENTIALS, use the credentials
of the IAM user who requests the sensitive data.


=head2 RoleName => Str

The name of the IAM role that is in the affected Amazon Web Services
account and Amazon Macie is allowed to assume when retrieving sensitive
data from affected S3 objects for the account. This value is null if
the value for retrievalMode is CALLER_CREDENTIALS.
