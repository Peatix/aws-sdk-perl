=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::UpdateRetrievalConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::UpdateRetrievalConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RetrievalMode => $value, ..., RoleName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::UpdateRetrievalConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RetrievalMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the access method and settings to use when retrieving
occurrences of sensitive data reported by findings. If your request
specifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to assume,
Amazon Macie verifies that the role exists and the attached policies
are configured correctly. If there's an issue, Macie returns an error.
For information about addressing the issue, see Configuration options
for retrieving sensitive data samples
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/findings-retrieve-sd-options.html)
in the I<Amazon Macie User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RetrievalMode => Str

The access method to use when retrieving sensitive data from affected
S3 objects. Valid values are: ASSUME_ROLE, assume an IAM role that is
in the affected Amazon Web Services account and delegates access to
Amazon Macie; and, CALLER_CREDENTIALS, use the credentials of the IAM
user who requests the sensitive data. If you specify ASSUME_ROLE, also
specify the name of an existing IAM role for Macie to assume
(roleName).

If you change this value from ASSUME_ROLE to CALLER_CREDENTIALS for an
existing configuration, Macie permanently deletes the external ID and
role name currently specified for the configuration. These settings
can't be recovered after they're deleted.


=head2 RoleName => Str

The name of the IAM role that is in the affected Amazon Web Services
account and Amazon Macie is allowed to assume when retrieving sensitive
data from affected S3 objects for the account. The trust and
permissions policies for the role must meet all requirements for Macie
to assume the role.
