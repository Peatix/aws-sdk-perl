=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::BucketStatisticsBySensitivity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::BucketStatisticsBySensitivity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClassificationError => $value, ..., Sensitive => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::BucketStatisticsBySensitivity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClassificationError

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides aggregated statistical data for sensitive data discovery
metrics that apply to S3 buckets, grouped by bucket sensitivity score
(sensitivityScore). If automated sensitive data discovery is currently
disabled for your account, the value for most of these metrics is 0.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClassificationError => L<Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations>

The aggregated statistical data for all buckets that have a sensitivity
score of -1.


=head2 NotClassified => L<Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations>

The aggregated statistical data for all buckets that have a sensitivity
score of 50.


=head2 NotSensitive => L<Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations>

The aggregated statistical data for all buckets that have a sensitivity
score of 1-49.


=head2 Sensitive => L<Paws::Macie2::SensitivityAggregations>

The aggregated statistical data for all buckets that have a sensitivity
score of 51-100.
