=head1 NAME

Paws::Macie2::SeverityLevel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Macie2::SeverityLevel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OccurrencesThreshold => $value, ..., Severity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Macie2::SeverityLevel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OccurrencesThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a severity level for findings that a custom data identifier
produces. A severity level determines which severity is assigned to the
findings, based on the number of occurrences of text that match the
custom data identifier's detection criteria.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OccurrencesThreshold => Int

The minimum number of occurrences of text that must match the custom
data identifier's detection criteria in order to produce a finding with
the specified severity (severity).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Severity => Str

The severity to assign to a finding: if the number of occurrences is
greater than or equal to the specified threshold
(occurrencesThreshold); and, if applicable, the number of occurrences
is less than the threshold for the next consecutive severity level for
the custom data identifier, moving from LOW to HIGH.
