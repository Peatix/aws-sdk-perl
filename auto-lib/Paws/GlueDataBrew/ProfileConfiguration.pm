=head1 NAME

Paws::GlueDataBrew::ProfileConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlueDataBrew::ProfileConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ColumnStatisticsConfigurations => $value, ..., ProfileColumns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlueDataBrew::ProfileConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ColumnStatisticsConfigurations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for profile jobs. Configuration can be used to select
columns, do evaluations, and override default parameters of
evaluations. When configuration is undefined, the profile job will
apply default settings to all supported columns.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ColumnStatisticsConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnStatisticsConfiguration>]

List of configurations for column evaluations.
ColumnStatisticsConfigurations are used to select evaluations and
override parameters of evaluations for particular columns. When
ColumnStatisticsConfigurations is undefined, the profile job will
profile all supported columns and run all supported evaluations.


=head2 DatasetStatisticsConfiguration => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::StatisticsConfiguration>

Configuration for inter-column evaluations. Configuration can be used
to select evaluations and override parameters of evaluations. When
configuration is undefined, the profile job will run all supported
inter-column evaluations.


=head2 EntityDetectorConfiguration => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::EntityDetectorConfiguration>

Configuration of entity detection for a profile job. When undefined,
entity detection is disabled.


=head2 ProfileColumns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnSelector>]

List of column selectors. ProfileColumns can be used to select columns
from the dataset. When ProfileColumns is undefined, the profile job
will profile all supported columns.
