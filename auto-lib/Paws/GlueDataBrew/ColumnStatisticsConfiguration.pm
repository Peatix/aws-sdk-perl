=head1 NAME

Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnStatisticsConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnStatisticsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Selectors => $value, ..., Statistics => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnStatisticsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Selectors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for column evaluations for a profile job.
ColumnStatisticsConfiguration can be used to select evaluations and
override parameters of evaluations for particular columns.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Selectors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::ColumnSelector>]

the dataset. When selectors are undefined, configuration will be
applied to all supported columns.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Statistics => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::StatisticsConfiguration>

Configuration for evaluations. Statistics can be used to select
evaluations and override parameters of evaluations.
