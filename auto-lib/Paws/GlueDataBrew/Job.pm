=head1 NAME

Paws::GlueDataBrew::Job

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlueDataBrew::Job object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., ValidationConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlueDataBrew::Job object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents all of the attributes of a DataBrew job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 DatabaseOutputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::DatabaseOutput>]

Represents a list of JDBC database output objects which defines the
output destination for a DataBrew recipe job to write into.


=head2 DataCatalogOutputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::DataCatalogOutput>]

One or more artifacts that represent the Glue Data Catalog output from
running the job.


=head2 DatasetName => Str

A dataset that the job is to process.


=head2 EncryptionKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an encryption key that is used to
protect the job output. For more information, see Encrypting data

The encryption mode for the job, which can be one of the following:

=over

=item *

C<SSE-KMS> - Server-side encryption with keys managed by KMS.

=item *

C<SSE-S3> - Server-side encryption with keys managed by Amazon S3.

=back



=head2 JobSample => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::JobSample>

A sample configuration for profile jobs only, which determines the
number of rows on which the profile job is run. If a C<JobSample> value
isn't provided, the default value is used. The default value is
CUSTOM_ROWS for the mode parameter and 20,000 for the size parameter.

=head2 Timeout => Int

The job's timeout in minutes. A job that attempts to run longer than
this timeout period ends with a status of C<TIMEOUT>.


=head2 Type => Str

The job type of the job, which must be one of the following:

C<PROFILE> - A job to analyze a dataset, to determine its size, data
types, data distribution, and more.

=item *

C<RECIPE> - A job to apply one or more transformations to a dataset.

=back



=head2 ValidationConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::ValidationConfiguration>]

List of validation configurations that are applied to the profile job.
