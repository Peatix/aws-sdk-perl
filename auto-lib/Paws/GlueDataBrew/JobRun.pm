=head1 NAME

Paws::GlueDataBrew::JobRun

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlueDataBrew::JobRun object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attempt => $value, ..., ValidationConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlueDataBrew::JobRun object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Attempt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 CompletedOn => Str

The date and time when the job completed processing.


=head2 DatabaseOutputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::DatabaseOutput>]

Represents a list of JDBC database output objects which defines the
output destination for a DataBrew recipe job to write into.


=head2 DataCatalogOutputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::DataCatalogOutput>]
