=head1 NAME

Paws::GlueDataBrew::Output

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlueDataBrew::Output object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompressionFormat => $value, ..., PartitionColumns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlueDataBrew::Output object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompressionFormat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents options that specify how and where in Amazon S3 DataBrew
writes the output generated by recipe jobs or profile jobs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompressionFormat => Str

The compression algorithm used to compress the output text of the job.


=head2 Format => Str

The data format of the output of the job.


=head2 FormatOptions => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::OutputFormatOptions>

Represents options that define how DataBrew formats job output files.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Location => L<Paws::GlueDataBrew::S3Location>

The location in Amazon S3 where the job writes its output.


=head2 MaxOutputFiles => Int

Maximum number of files to be generated by the job and written to the
output folder. For output partitioned by column(s), the MaxOutputFiles
value is the maximum number of files per partition.


=head2 Overwrite => Bool

A value that, if true, means that any data in the location specified
for output is overwritten with new output.


=head2 PartitionColumns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names of one or more partition columns for the output of the job.



=head1 SEE ALSO
