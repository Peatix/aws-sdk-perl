=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedCapacity => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a location and its corresponding stream capacity and status.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedCapacity => Int

This value is the number of compute resources that a stream group has
provisioned and is ready to stream. It includes resources that are
currently streaming and resources that are idle and ready to respond to
stream requests.


=head2 AlwaysOnCapacity => Int

The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream
requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use
or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming
session.


=head2 IdleCapacity => Int

This value is the amount of allocated capacity that is not currently
streaming. It represents the stream group's availability to respond to
new stream requests, but not including on-demand capacity.


=head2 LocationName => Str

A location's name. For example, C<us-east-1>. For a complete list of
locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to Regions and
quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html)
in the I<Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide>.


=head2 OnDemandCapacity => Int

The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in
response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has
terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a
greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes).


=head2 RequestedCapacity => Int

This value is the total number of compute resources that you request
for a stream group. This includes resources that Amazon GameLift
Streams has either already provisioned or is working to provision. You
request capacity for each location in a stream group.


=head2 Status => Str

This value is set of locations, including their name, current status,
and capacities.

A location can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

B<ACTIVATING>: Amazon GameLift Streams is preparing the location. You
cannot stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location yet.

=item *

B<ACTIVE>: The location is provisioned with initial capacity. You can
now stream from, scale the capacity of, or remove this location.

=item *

B<ERROR>: Amazon GameLift Streams failed to set up this location. The
StatusReason field describes the error. You can remove this location
and try to add it again.

=item *

B<REMOVING>: Amazon GameLift Streams is working to remove this
location. It releases all provisioned capacity for this location in
this stream group.
