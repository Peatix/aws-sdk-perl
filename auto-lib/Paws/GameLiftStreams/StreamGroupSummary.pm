=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLiftStreams::StreamGroupSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLiftStreams::StreamGroupSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., StreamClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLiftStreams::StreamGroupSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

Describes a Amazon GameLift Streams stream group resource for hosting
content streams. To retrieve additional stream group details, call
GetStreamGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_GetStreamGroup.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html)
or ID that uniquely identifies the stream group resource. Format
example:
ARN-C<arn:aws:gameliftstreams:us-west-2:123456789012:streamgroup/sg-1AB2C3De4>
or ID-C<sg-1AB2C3De4>.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

A timestamp that indicates when this resource was created. Timestamps
are expressed using in ISO8601 format, such as:
