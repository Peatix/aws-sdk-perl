Provides details about the stream session's exported files.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OutputUri => Str

The S3 bucket URI where Amazon GameLift Streams uploaded the set of
compressed exported files for a stream session. Amazon GameLift Streams
generates a ZIP file name based on the stream session metadata.
Alternatively, you can provide a custom file name with a C<.zip> file
extension.

Example 1: If you provide an S3 URI called
C<s3://MyBucket/MyGame_Session1.zip>, then Amazon GameLift Streams will
save the files at that location.

Example 2: If you provide an S3 URI called
C<s3://MyBucket/MyGameSessions_ExportedFiles/>, then Amazon GameLift
Streams will save the files at
C<s3://MyBucket/MyGameSessions_ExportedFiles/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-appId-sg-Id-sessionId.zip>
or another similar name.


=head2 Status => Str

The result of the ExportStreamSessionFiles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_ExportStreamSessionFiles.html)
operation.


=head2 StatusReason => Str

A short description of the reason the export is in C<FAILED> status.
