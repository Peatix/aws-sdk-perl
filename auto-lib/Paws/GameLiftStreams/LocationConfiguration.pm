=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlwaysOnCapacity => $value, ..., OnDemandCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLiftStreams::LocationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlwaysOnCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration settings that define a stream group's stream capacity for
a location. When configuring a location for the first time, you must
specify a numeric value for at least one of the two capacity types. To
update the capacity for an existing stream group, call
UpdateStreamGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_UpdateStreamGroup.html).
To add a new location and specify its capacity, call
AddStreamGroupLocations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/apireference/API_AddStreamGroupLocations.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlwaysOnCapacity => Int

The streaming capacity that is allocated and ready to handle stream
requests without delay. You pay for this capacity whether it's in use
or not. Best for quickest time from streaming request to streaming
session.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LocationName => Str

A location's name. For example, C<us-east-1>. For a complete list of
locations that Amazon GameLift Streams supports, refer to Regions and
quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gameliftstreams/latest/developerguide/regions-quotas.html)
in the I<Amazon GameLift Streams Developer Guide>.


=head2 OnDemandCapacity => Int

The streaming capacity that Amazon GameLift Streams can allocate in
response to stream requests, and then de-allocate when the session has
terminated. This offers a cost control measure at the expense of a
greater startup time (typically under 5 minutes).
