=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelHierarchyDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelHierarchyDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChildAssetModelId => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelHierarchyDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChildAssetModelId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains an asset model hierarchy used in asset model creation. An
asset model hierarchy determines the kind (or type) of asset that can
belong to a hierarchy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ChildAssetModelId => Str

The ID of an asset model for this hierarchy. This can be either the
actual ID in UUID format, or else C<externalId:> followed by the
external ID, if it has one. For more information, see Referencing
objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

An external ID to assign to the asset model hierarchy. The external ID
must be unique among asset model hierarchies within this asset model.
For more information, see Using external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID to assign to the asset model hierarchy, if desired. IoT SiteWise
automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this parameter is never
required. However, if you prefer to supply your own ID instead, you can
specify it here in UUID format. If you specify your own ID, it must be
globally unique.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the asset model hierarchy definition (as specified in the
CreateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAssetModel.html)
or UpdateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetModel.html)
API operation).
