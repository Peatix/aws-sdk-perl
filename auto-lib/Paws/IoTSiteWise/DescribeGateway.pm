=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $iotsitewise = Paws->service('IoTSiteWise');
    my $DescribeGatewayResponse = $iotsitewise->DescribeGateway(
      GatewayId => 'MyID',

    );

    # Results:
    my $CreationDate = $DescribeGatewayResponse->CreationDate;
    my $GatewayArn   = $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayArn;
    my $GatewayCapabilitySummaries =
      $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayCapabilitySummaries;
    my $GatewayId       = $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayId;
    my $GatewayName     = $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayName;
    my $GatewayPlatform = $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayPlatform;
    my $GatewayVersion  = $DescribeGatewayResponse->GatewayVersion;
    my $LastUpdateDate  = $DescribeGatewayResponse->LastUpdateDate;

    # Returns a L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::DescribeGatewayResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
