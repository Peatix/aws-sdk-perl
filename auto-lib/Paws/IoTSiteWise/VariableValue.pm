=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::VariableValue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::VariableValue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HierarchyId => $value, ..., PropertyPath => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::VariableValue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HierarchyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Identifies a property value used in an expression.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HierarchyId => Str

The ID of the hierarchy to query for the property ID. You can use the
hierarchy's name instead of the hierarchy's ID. If the hierarchy has an
external ID, you can specify C<externalId:> followed by the external
ID. For more information, see Using external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.

You use a hierarchy ID instead of a model ID because you can have
several hierarchies using the same model and therefore the same
C<propertyId>. For example, you might have separately grouped assets
that come from the same asset model. For more information, see Asset
hierarchies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 PropertyId => Str

The ID of the property to use as the variable. You can use the property
C<name> if it's from the same asset model. If the property has an
external ID, you can specify C<externalId:> followed by the external
ID. For more information, see Using external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 PropertyPath => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelPropertyPathSegment>]

The path of the property.
