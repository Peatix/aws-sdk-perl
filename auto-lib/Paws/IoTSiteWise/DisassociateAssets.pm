=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::DisassociateAssets - Arguments for method DisassociateAssets on L<Paws::IoTSiteWise>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateAssets on the
L<AWS IoT SiteWise|Paws::IoTSiteWise> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateAssets.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateAssets.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $iotsitewise = Paws->service('IoTSiteWise');
    $iotsitewise->DisassociateAssets(
      AssetId      => 'MyCustomID',
      ChildAssetId => 'MyCustomID',
      HierarchyId  => 'MyCustomID',
      ClientToken  => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iotsitewise/DisassociateAssets>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AssetId => Str

The ID of the parent asset from which to disassociate the child asset.
This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else C<externalId:>
followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see
Referencing objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ChildAssetId => Str

The ID of the child asset to disassociate. This can be either the
actual ID in UUID format, or else C<externalId:> followed by the
external ID, if it has one. For more information, see Referencing
objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.



=head2 ClientToken => Str

A unique case-sensitive identifier that you can provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. Don't reuse this client token if a new
idempotent request is required.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> HierarchyId => Str

The ID of a hierarchy in the parent asset's model. (This can be either
the actual ID in UUID format, or else C<externalId:> followed by the
external ID, if it has one. For more information, see Referencing
objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.) Hierarchies allow different
groupings of assets to be formed that all come from the same asset
model. You can use the hierarchy ID to identify the correct asset to
disassociate. For more information, see Asset hierarchies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.
