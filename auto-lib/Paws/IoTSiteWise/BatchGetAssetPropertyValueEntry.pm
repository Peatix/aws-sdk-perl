=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssetId => $value, ..., PropertyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssetId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information for an asset property value entry that is
associated with the BatchGetAssetPropertyValue
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetAssetPropertyValue.html)
API.

To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

=over

=item *

The C<assetId> and C<propertyId> of an asset property.

=item *

A C<propertyAlias>, which is a data stream alias (for example,
C</company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature>). To define an asset
property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).

The ID of the entry.


=head2 PropertyAlias => Str

The alias that identifies the property, such as an OPC-UA server data
stream path (for example,
