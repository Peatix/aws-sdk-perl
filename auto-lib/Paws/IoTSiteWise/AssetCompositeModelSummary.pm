=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetCompositeModelSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetCompositeModelSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetCompositeModelSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a summary of the composite model for a specific asset.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A description of the composite model that this summary describes.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

An external ID to assign to the asset model.

If the composite model is a derived composite model, or one nested

C<UpdateAssetModelCompositeModel> and specifying the derived ID of the
model or property from the created model it's a part of.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The ID of the composite model that this summary describes.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the composite model that this summary describes.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Path => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetCompositeModelPathSegment>]

The path that includes all the components of the asset model for the
asset.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of asset model.

in the composite models of other asset models. You can't create assets
directly from this type of asset model.
