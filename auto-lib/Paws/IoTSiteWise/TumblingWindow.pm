=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::TumblingWindow

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::TumblingWindow object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Interval => $value, ..., Offset => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::TumblingWindow object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Interval

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a tumbling window, which is a repeating fixed-sized,
non-overlapping, and contiguous time window. You can use this window in
metrics to aggregate data from properties and other assets.

You can use C<m>, C<h>, C<d>, and C<w> when you specify an interval or
offset. Note that C<m> represents minutes, C<h> represents hours, C<d>
represents days, and C<w> represents weeks. You can also use C<s> to
represent seconds in C<offset>.

The C<interval> and C<offset> parameters support the ISO 8601 format
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). For example, C<PT5S>
represents 5 seconds, C<PT5M> represents 5 minutes, and C<PT5H>
represents 5 hours.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Interval => Str

The time interval for the tumbling window. The interval time must be
between 1 minute and 1 week.

IoT SiteWise computes the C<1w> interval the end of Sunday at midnight
each week (UTC), the C<1d> interval at the end of each day at midnight
(UTC), the C<1h> interval at the end of each hour, and so on.

When IoT SiteWise aggregates data points for metric computations, the
start of each interval is exclusive and the end of each interval is
inclusive. IoT SiteWise places the computed data point at the end of
the interval.


=head2 Offset => Str

The offset for the tumbling window. The C<offset> parameter accepts the
following:

=over

=item *

The offset time.

For example, if you specify C<18h> for C<offset> and C<1d> for
C<interval>, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:

=over

=item *

If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.

=item *

If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

=back

=item *

The ISO 8601 format.

For example, if you specify C<PT18H> for C<offset> and C<1d> for
C<interval>, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the following ways:

=over

=item *

If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) on the day when you create the metric.

=item *

If you create the metric after 6 PM (UTC), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (UTC) the next day.

=back

=item *

The 24-hour clock.

For example, if you specify C<00:03:00> for C<offset>, C<5m> for
C<interval>, and you create the metric at 2 PM (UTC), you get the first
aggregation result at 2:03 PM (UTC). You get the second aggregation
result at 2:08 PM (UTC).

=item *

The offset time zone.

For example, if you specify C<2021-07-23T18:00-08> for C<offset> and
C<1d> for C<interval>, IoT SiteWise aggregates data in one of the
following ways:

=over

=item *

If you create the metric before or at 6 PM (PST), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) on the day when you create the metric.

=item *

If you create the metric after 6 PM (PST), you get the first
aggregation result at 6 PM (PST) the next day.
