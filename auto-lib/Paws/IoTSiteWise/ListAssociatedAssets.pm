=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::ListAssociatedAssets - Arguments for method ListAssociatedAssets on L<Paws::IoTSiteWise>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListAssociatedAssets on the
L<AWS IoT SiteWise|Paws::IoTSiteWise> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListAssociatedAssets.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListAssociatedAssets.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $iotsitewise = Paws->service('IoTSiteWise');
    my $ListAssociatedAssetsResponse = $iotsitewise->ListAssociatedAssets(
      AssetId            => 'MyCustomID',
      HierarchyId        => 'MyCustomID',     # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults         => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken          => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
      TraversalDirection => 'PARENT',         # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AssetSummaries = $ListAssociatedAssetsResponse->AssetSummaries;
    my $NextToken      = $ListAssociatedAssetsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::ListAssociatedAssetsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/iotsitewise/ListAssociatedAssets>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AssetId => Str

The ID of the asset to query. This can be either the actual ID in UUID
format, or else C<externalId:> followed by the external ID, if it has
one. For more information, see Referencing objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.



=head2 HierarchyId => Str

(Optional) If you don't provide a C<hierarchyId>, all the immediate
assets in the C<traversalDirection> will be returned.

The ID of the hierarchy by which child assets are associated to the
asset. (This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else
C<externalId:> followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more
information, see Referencing objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.)

For more information, see Asset hierarchies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-hierarchies.html)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results to return for each paginated request.

Default: 50



=head2 NextToken => Str

The token to be used for the next set of paginated results.



=head2 TraversalDirection => Str

The direction to list associated assets. Choose one of the following
options:

=over

=item *

C<CHILD> E<ndash> The list includes all child assets associated to the
asset.

=item *

C<PARENT> E<ndash> The list includes the asset's parent asset.

=back

Default: C<CHILD>

Valid values are: C<"PARENT">, C<"CHILD">
