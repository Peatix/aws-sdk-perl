=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelCompositeModelDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelCompositeModelDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelCompositeModelDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a composite model definition in an asset model. This composite
model definition is applied to all assets created from the asset model.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the composite model.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

An external ID to assign to the composite model. The external ID must
be unique among composite models within this asset model. For more
information, see Using external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID to assign to the composite model, if desired. IoT SiteWise
automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this parameter is never
required. However, if you prefer to supply your own ID instead, you can
specify it here in UUID format. If you specify your own ID, it must be
globally unique.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the composite model.


=head2 Properties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelPropertyDefinition>]

The asset property definitions for this composite model.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of the composite model. For alarm composite models, this type
is C<AWS/ALARM>.
