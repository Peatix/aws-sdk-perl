=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::Metric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::Metric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Expression => $value, ..., Window => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::Metric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Expression

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains an asset metric property. With metrics, you can calculate
aggregate functions, such as an average, maximum, or minimum, as
specified through an expression. A metric maps several values to a
single value (such as a sum).

The maximum number of dependent/cascading variables used in any one
metric calculation is 10. Therefore, a I<root> metric can have up to 10
cascading metrics in its computational dependency tree. Additionally, a
metric can only have a data type of C<DOUBLE> and consume properties
with data types of C<INTEGER> or C<DOUBLE>.

For more information, see Metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/asset-properties.html#metrics)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Expression => Str

The mathematical expression that defines the metric aggregation
function. You can specify up to 10 variables per expression. You can
specify up to 10 functions per expression.

For more information, see Quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/quotas.html)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 ProcessingConfig => L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::MetricProcessingConfig>

The processing configuration for the given metric property. You can
configure metrics to be computed at the edge or in the Amazon Web
Services Cloud. By default, metrics are forwarded to the cloud.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Variables => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::ExpressionVariable>]

The list of variables used in the expression.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Window => L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::MetricWindow>

The window (time interval) over which IoT SiteWise computes the
metric's aggregation expression. IoT SiteWise computes one data point
per C<window>.
