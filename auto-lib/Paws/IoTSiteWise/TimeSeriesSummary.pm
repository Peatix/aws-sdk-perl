=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::TimeSeriesSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::TimeSeriesSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Alias => $value, ..., TimeSeriesLastUpdateDate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::TimeSeriesSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Alias

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a summary of a time series (data stream).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Alias => Str

The alias that identifies the time series.


=head2 AssetId => Str

The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataType => Str

The data type of the time series.

If you specify C<STRUCT>, you must also specify C<dataTypeSpec> to
identify the type of the structure for this time series.


=head2 DataTypeSpec => Str

The data type of the structure for this time series. This parameter is
required for time series that have the C<STRUCT> data type.

The options for this parameter depend on the type of the composite
model in which you created the asset property that is associated with
your time series. Use C<AWS/ALARM_STATE> for alarm state in alarm
composite models.


=head2 PropertyId => Str

The ID of the asset property, in UUID format.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeSeriesArn => Str

The ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
of the time series, which has the following format.

C<arn:${Partition}:iotsitewise:${Region}:${Account}:time-series/${TimeSeriesId}>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeSeriesCreationDate => Str

The date that the time series was created, in Unix epoch time.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeSeriesId => Str

The ID of the time series.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeSeriesLastUpdateDate => Str

The date that the time series was last updated, in Unix epoch time.
