=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueHistoryEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueHistoryEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssetId => $value, ..., TimeOrdering => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::BatchGetAssetPropertyValueHistoryEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssetId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information for an asset property historical value entry that
is associated with the BatchGetAssetPropertyValueHistory
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_BatchGetAssetPropertyValue.html)
API.

To identify an asset property, you must specify one of the following:

=over

=item *

The C<assetId> and C<propertyId> of an asset property.

=item *

A C<propertyAlias>, which is a data stream alias (for example,
C</company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature>). To define an asset
property's alias, see UpdateAssetProperty
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetProperty.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssetId => Str

The ID of the asset in which the asset property was created.


=head2 EndDate => Str

The inclusive end of the range from which to query historical data,
expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EntryId => Str

The ID of the entry.


=head2 PropertyAlias => Str

The alias that identifies the property, such as an OPC-UA server data
stream path (for example,
C</company/windfarm/3/turbine/7/temperature>). For more information,
see Mapping industrial data streams to asset properties
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/connect-data-streams.html)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 PropertyId => Str

The ID of the asset property, in UUID format.


=head2 Qualities => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The quality by which to filter asset data.


=head2 StartDate => Str

The exclusive start of the range from which to query historical data,
expressed in seconds in Unix epoch time.


=head2 TimeOrdering => Str

The chronological sorting order of the requested information.

Default: C<ASCENDING>
