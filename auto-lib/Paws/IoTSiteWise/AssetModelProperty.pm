=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelProperty

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelProperty object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataType => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelProperty object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about an asset model property.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataType => Str

The data type of the asset model property.

If you specify C<STRUCT>, you must also specify C<dataTypeSpec> to
identify the type of the structure for this property.


=head2 DataTypeSpec => Str

The data type of the structure for this property. This parameter exists
on properties that have the C<STRUCT> data type.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

The external ID (if any) provided in the CreateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAssetModel.html)
or UpdateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetModel.html)
operation. You can assign an external ID by specifying this value as
part of a call to UpdateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetModel.html).
However, you can't change the external ID if one is already assigned.
For more information, see Using external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-ids)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID of the asset model property.

=over

=item *

If you are callling UpdateAssetModel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAssetModel.html)
to create a I<new> property: You can specify its ID here, if desired.
IoT SiteWise automatically generates a unique ID for you, so this
parameter is never required. However, if you prefer to supply your own
ID instead, you can specify it here in UUID format. If you specify your
own ID, it must be globally unique.

=item *

If you are calling UpdateAssetModel to modify an I<existing> property:
This can be either the actual ID in UUID format, or else C<externalId:>
followed by the external ID, if it has one. For more information, see
Referencing objects with external IDs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/object-ids.html#external-id-references)
in the I<IoT SiteWise User Guide>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the asset model property.


=head2 Path => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::AssetModelPropertyPathSegment>]

The structured path to the property from the root of the asset model.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => L<Paws::IoTSiteWise::PropertyType>

The property type (see C<PropertyType>).


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit of the asset model property, such as C<Newtons> or C<RPM>.
