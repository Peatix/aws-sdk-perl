=head1 NAME

Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakeSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakeSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowExternalDataFiltering => $value, ..., TrustedResourceOwners => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakeSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowExternalDataFiltering

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure representing a list of Lake Formation principals designated
as data lake administrators and lists of principal permission entries
for default create database and default create table permissions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowExternalDataFiltering => Bool

Whether to allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data managed by Lake
Formation.

If true, you allow Amazon EMR clusters to access data in Amazon S3
locations that are registered with Lake Formation.

If false or null, no Amazon EMR clusters will be able to access data in
Amazon S3 locations that are registered with Lake Formation.

For more information, see (Optional) Allow external data filtering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/initial-LF-setup.html#external-data-filter).


=head2 AllowFullTableExternalDataAccess => Bool

Whether to allow a third-party query engine to get data access
credentials without session tags when a caller has full data access
permissions.


=head2 AuthorizedSessionTagValueList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lake Formation relies on a privileged process secured by Amazon EMR or
the third party integrator to tag the user's role while assuming it.
Lake Formation will publish the acceptable key-value pair, for example
key = "LakeFormationTrustedCaller" and value = "TRUE" and the third
party integrator must properly tag the temporary security credentials
that will be used to call Lake Formation's administrative APIs.


=head2 CreateDatabaseDefaultPermissions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LakeFormation::PrincipalPermissions>]

Specifies whether access control on newly created database is managed
by Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permissions.

A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permissions. A
value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indicates access
control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as the setting "Use
only IAM access control," and is for backward compatibility with the
Glue permission model implemented by IAM permissions.

The only permitted values are an empty array or an array that contains
a single JSON object that grants ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS.

For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings for
Your Data Lake
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/change-settings.html).


=head2 CreateTableDefaultPermissions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LakeFormation::PrincipalPermissions>]

Specifies whether access control on newly created table is managed by
Lake Formation permissions or exclusively by IAM permissions.

A null value indicates access control by Lake Formation permissions. A
value that assigns ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS indicates access
control by IAM permissions. This is referred to as the setting "Use
only IAM access control," and is for backward compatibility with the
Glue permission model implemented by IAM permissions.

The only permitted values are an empty array or an array that contains
a single JSON object that grants ALL to IAM_ALLOWED_PRINCIPALS.

For more information, see Changing the Default Security Settings for
Your Data Lake
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/change-settings.html).


=head2 DataLakeAdmins => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakePrincipal>]

A list of Lake Formation principals. Supported principals are IAM users
or IAM roles.


=head2 ExternalDataFilteringAllowList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakePrincipal>]

A list of the account IDs of Amazon Web Services accounts with Amazon
EMR clusters that are to perform data filtering.E<gt>


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::LakeFormation::ParametersMap>

A key-value map that provides an additional configuration on your data
lake. CROSS_ACCOUNT_VERSION is the key you can configure in the
Parameters field. Accepted values for the CrossAccountVersion key are
1, 2, 3, and 4.


=head2 ReadOnlyAdmins => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LakeFormation::DataLakePrincipal>]

A list of Lake Formation principals with only view access to the
resources, without the ability to make changes. Supported principals
are IAM users or IAM roles.


=head2 TrustedResourceOwners => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the resource-owning account IDs that the caller's account can
use to share their user access details (user ARNs). The user ARNs can
be logged in the resource owner's CloudTrail log.

You may want to specify this property when you are in a high-trust
boundary, such as the same team or company.
