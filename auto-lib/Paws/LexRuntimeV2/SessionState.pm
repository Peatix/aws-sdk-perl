Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexRuntimeV2::SessionState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveContexts => $value, ..., SessionAttributes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexRuntimeV2::SessionState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveContexts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The state of the user's session with Amazon Lex V2.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveContexts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::ActiveContext>]

One or more contexts that indicate to Amazon Lex V2 the context of a
request. When a context is active, Amazon Lex V2 considers intents with
the matching context as a trigger as the next intent in a session.


=head2 DialogAction => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::DialogAction>

The next step that Amazon Lex V2 should take in the conversation with a
user.


=head2 Intent => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::Intent>

The active intent that Amazon Lex V2 is processing.


=head2 OriginatingRequestId => Str

A unique identifier for a specific request.


=head2 RuntimeHints => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::RuntimeHints>

Hints for phrases that a customer is likely to use for a slot. Amazon
Lex V2 uses the hints to help determine the correct value of a slot.


=head2 SessionAttributes => L<Paws::LexRuntimeV2::StringMap>

Map of key/value pairs representing session-specific context
information. It contains application information passed between Amazon
Lex V2 and a client application.
