=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InterpretedValue => Str

The value that Amazon Lex V2 determines for the slot, given the user
input. The actual value depends on the setting of the value selection
strategy for the bot. You can choose to use the value entered by the
user, or you can have Amazon Lex V2 choose the first value in the
C<resolvedValues> list.


=head2 OriginalValue => Str

The part of the user's response to the slot elicitation that Amazon Lex
V2 determines is relevant to the slot value.


=head2 ResolvedValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of values that Amazon Lex V2 determines are possible resolutions
for the user input. The first value matches the C<interpretedValue>.
