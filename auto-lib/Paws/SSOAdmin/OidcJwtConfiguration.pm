=head1 NAME

Paws::SSOAdmin::OidcJwtConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSOAdmin::OidcJwtConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClaimAttributePath => $value, ..., JwksRetrievalOption => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSOAdmin::OidcJwtConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClaimAttributePath

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that describes configuration settings for a trusted token
issuer that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClaimAttributePath => Str

The path of the source attribute in the JWT from the trusted token
issuer. The attribute mapped by this JMESPath expression is compared
against the attribute mapped by C<IdentityStoreAttributePath> when a
trusted token issuer token is exchanged for an IAM Identity Center
token.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IdentityStoreAttributePath => Str

The path of the destination attribute in a JWT from IAM Identity
Center. The attribute mapped by this JMESPath expression is compared
against the attribute mapped by C<ClaimAttributePath> when a trusted
token issuer token is exchanged for an IAM Identity Center token.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IssuerUrl => Str

The URL that IAM Identity Center uses for OpenID Discovery. OpenID
Discovery is used to obtain the information required to verify the
tokens that the trusted token issuer generates.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JwksRetrievalOption => Str

The method that the trusted token issuer can use to retrieve the JSON
Web Key Set used to verify a JWT.
