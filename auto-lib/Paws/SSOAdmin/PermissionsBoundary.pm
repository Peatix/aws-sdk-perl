=head1 NAME

Paws::SSOAdmin::PermissionsBoundary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSOAdmin::PermissionsBoundary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomerManagedPolicyReference => $value, ..., ManagedPolicyArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSOAdmin::PermissionsBoundary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomerManagedPolicyReference

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration of the Amazon Web Services managed or
customer managed policy that you want to set as a permissions boundary.
Specify either C<CustomerManagedPolicyReference> to use the name and
path of a customer managed policy, or C<ManagedPolicyArn> to use the
ARN of an Amazon Web Services managed policy. A permissions boundary
represents the maximum permissions that any policy can grant your role.
For more information, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)
in the I<IAM User Guide>.

Policies used as permissions boundaries don't provide permissions. You
must also attach an IAM policy to the role. To learn how the effective
permissions for a role are evaluated, see IAM JSON policy evaluation
logic
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html)
in the I<IAM User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomerManagedPolicyReference => L<Paws::SSOAdmin::CustomerManagedPolicyReference>

an IAM policy that matches the name and path in each Amazon Web
Services account where you want to deploy your permission set.


=head2 ManagedPolicyArn => Str

The Amazon Web Services managed policy ARN that you want to attach to a
permission set as a permissions boundary.
