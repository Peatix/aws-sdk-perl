This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSOAdmin::AccessControlAttribute object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSOAdmin::AccessControlAttribute object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are IAM Identity Center identity store attributes that you can
configure for use in attributes-based access control (ABAC). You can
create permissions policies that determine who can access your Amazon
Web Services resources based upon the configured attribute values. When
you enable ABAC and specify C<AccessControlAttributes>, IAM Identity
Center passes the attribute values of the authenticated user into IAM
for use in policy evaluation.
