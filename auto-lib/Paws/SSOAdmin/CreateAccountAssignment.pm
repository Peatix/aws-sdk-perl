=head1 NAME

Paws::SSOAdmin::CreateAccountAssignment - Arguments for method CreateAccountAssignment on L<Paws::SSOAdmin>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateAccountAssignment on the
L<AWS Single Sign-On Admin|Paws::SSOAdmin> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateAccountAssignment.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateAccountAssignment.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sso = Paws->service('SSOAdmin');
    my $CreateAccountAssignmentResponse = $sso->CreateAccountAssignment(
      InstanceArn      => 'MyInstanceArn',
      PermissionSetArn => 'MyPermissionSetArn',
      PrincipalId      => 'MyPrincipalId',
      PrincipalType    => 'USER',
      TargetId         => 'MyTargetId',
      TargetType       => 'AWS_ACCOUNT',

    );

    # Results:
    my $AccountAssignmentCreationStatus =
      $CreateAccountAssignmentResponse->AccountAssignmentCreationStatus;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SSOAdmin::CreateAccountAssignmentResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/sso/CreateAccountAssignment>
