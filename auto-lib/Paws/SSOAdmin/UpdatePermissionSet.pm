Paws::SSOAdmin::UpdatePermissionSet - Arguments for method UpdatePermissionSet on L<Paws::SSOAdmin>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdatePermissionSet on the
L<AWS Single Sign-On Admin|Paws::SSOAdmin> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdatePermissionSet.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdatePermissionSet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $sso = Paws->service('SSOAdmin');
    my $UpdatePermissionSetResponse = $sso->UpdatePermissionSet(
      InstanceArn      => 'MyInstanceArn',
      PermissionSetArn => 'MyPermissionSetArn',
      Description      => 'MyPermissionSetDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      RelayState       => 'MyRelayState',                  # OPTIONAL

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
