=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Outposts::Endpoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Outposts::Endpoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessType => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Outposts::Endpoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon S3 on Outposts Access Points simplify managing data access at
scale for shared datasets in S3 on Outposts. S3 on Outposts uses
endpoints to connect to Outposts buckets so that you can perform
actions within your virtual private cloud (VPC). For more information,
see Accessing S3 on Outposts using VPC-only access points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WorkingWithS3Outposts.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide>.
