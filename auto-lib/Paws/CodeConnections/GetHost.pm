=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeConnections::GetHost - Arguments for method GetHost on L<Paws::CodeConnections>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetHost on the
L<AWS CodeConnections|Paws::CodeConnections> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetHost.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetHost.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeconnections = Paws->service('CodeConnections');
    my $GetHostOutput = $codeconnections->GetHost(
      HostArn => 'MyHostArn',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Name             = $GetHostOutput->Name;
    my $ProviderEndpoint = $GetHostOutput->ProviderEndpoint;
    my $ProviderType     = $GetHostOutput->ProviderType;
    my $Status           = $GetHostOutput->Status;
    my $VpcConfiguration = $GetHostOutput->VpcConfiguration;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeConnections::GetHostOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codeconnections/GetHost>
