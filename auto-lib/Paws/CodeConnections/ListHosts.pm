=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeConnections::ListHosts - Arguments for method ListHosts on L<Paws::CodeConnections>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListHosts on the
L<AWS CodeConnections|Paws::CodeConnections> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListHosts.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListHosts.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeconnections = Paws->service('CodeConnections');
    my $ListHostsOutput = $codeconnections->ListHosts(
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Hosts     = $ListHostsOutput->Hosts;
    my $NextToken = $ListHostsOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeConnections::ListHostsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codeconnections/ListHosts>
