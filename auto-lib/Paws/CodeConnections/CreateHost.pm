=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeConnections::CreateHost - Arguments for method CreateHost on L<Paws::CodeConnections>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateHost on the
L<AWS CodeConnections|Paws::CodeConnections> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateHost.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateHost.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeconnections = Paws->service('CodeConnections');
    my $CreateHostOutput = $codeconnections->CreateHost(
      Name             => 'MyHostName',
      ProviderEndpoint => 'MyUrl',
      ProviderType     => 'Bitbucket',
      Tags             => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      VpcConfiguration => {
        SecurityGroupIds => [
          'MySecurityGroupId', ...    # min: 11, max: 20
        ],    # min: 1, max: 10
        SubnetIds => [
          'MySubnetId', ...    # min: 15, max: 24
        ],    # min: 1, max: 10
        VpcId          => 'MyVpcId',             # min: 12, max: 21
        TlsCertificate => 'MyTlsCertificate',    # min: 1, max: 16384; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $HostArn = $CreateHostOutput->HostArn;
    my $Tags    = $CreateHostOutput->Tags;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeConnections::CreateHostOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
