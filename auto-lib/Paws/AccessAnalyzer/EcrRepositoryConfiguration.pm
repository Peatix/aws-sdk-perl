This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EcrRepositoryConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RepositoryPolicy => $value, ..., RepositoryPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EcrRepositoryConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RepositoryPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The proposed access control configuration for an Amazon ECR repository.
You can propose a configuration for a new Amazon ECR repository or an
existing Amazon ECR repository that you own by specifying the Amazon
ECR policy. For more information, see Repository
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_Repository.html).

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing Amazon ECR repository and you
do not specify the Amazon ECR policy, then the access preview uses the
existing Amazon ECR policy for the repository.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
policy, then the access preview assumes an Amazon ECR repository
without a policy.

=item *

To propose deletion of an existing Amazon ECR repository policy, you
can specify an empty string for the Amazon ECR policy.
