=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::DynamodbStreamConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::DynamodbStreamConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { StreamPolicy => $value, ..., StreamPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::DynamodbStreamConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->StreamPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The proposed access control configuration for a DynamoDB stream. You
can propose a configuration for a new DynamoDB stream or an existing
DynamoDB stream that you own by specifying the policy for the DynamoDB
stream. For more information, see PutResourcePolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_PutResourcePolicy.html).

=over

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing DynamoDB stream and you do not
specify the DynamoDB policy, then the access preview uses the existing
DynamoDB policy for the stream.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
policy, then the access preview assumes a DynamoDB stream without a
policy.

=item *

To propose deletion of an existing DynamoDB stream policy, you can
specify an empty string for the DynamoDB policy.
