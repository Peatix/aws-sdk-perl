This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EfsFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FileSystemPolicy => $value, ..., FileSystemPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EfsFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FileSystemPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The proposed access control configuration for an Amazon EFS file
system. You can propose a configuration for a new Amazon EFS file
system or an existing Amazon EFS file system that you own by specifying
the Amazon EFS policy. For more information, see Using file systems in
Amazon EFS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/using-fs.html).

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing Amazon EFS file system and you
do not specify the Amazon EFS policy, then the access preview uses the
existing Amazon EFS policy for the file system.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
policy, then the access preview assumes an Amazon EFS file system
without a policy.

=item *

To propose deletion of an existing Amazon EFS file system policy, you
can specify an empty string for the Amazon EFS policy.
