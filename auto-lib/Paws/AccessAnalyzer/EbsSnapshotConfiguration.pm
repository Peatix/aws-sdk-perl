=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EbsSnapshotConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EbsSnapshotConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Groups => $value, ..., UserIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::EbsSnapshotConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Groups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The proposed access control configuration for an Amazon EBS volume
snapshot. You can propose a configuration for a new Amazon EBS volume
snapshot or an Amazon EBS volume snapshot that you own by specifying
the user IDs, groups, and optional KMS encryption key. For more
information, see ModifySnapshotAttribute
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifySnapshotAttribute.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Groups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The groups that have access to the Amazon EBS volume snapshot. If the
value C<all> is specified, then the Amazon EBS volume snapshot is
public.

=over

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing Amazon EBS volume snapshot and
you do not specify the C<groups>, then the access preview uses the
existing shared C<groups> for the snapshot.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
C<groups>, then the access preview considers the snapshot without any
C<groups>.

=item *

To propose deletion of existing shared C<groups>, you can specify an
empty list for C<groups>.

=back



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The KMS key identifier for an encrypted Amazon EBS volume snapshot. The
KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for
the KMS key.

=over

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing Amazon EBS volume snapshot and
you do not specify the C<kmsKeyId>, or you specify an empty string,
then the access preview uses the existing C<kmsKeyId> of the snapshot.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
C<kmsKeyId>, the access preview considers the snapshot as unencrypted.

=back



=head2 UserIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that have access to the
Amazon EBS volume snapshot.

=over

=item *

If the configuration is for an existing Amazon EBS volume snapshot and
you do not specify the C<userIds>, then the access preview uses the
existing shared C<userIds> for the snapshot.

=item *

If the access preview is for a new resource and you do not specify the
C<userIds>, then the access preview considers the snapshot without any
C<userIds>.

=item *

To propose deletion of existing shared C<accountIds>, you can specify
an empty list for C<userIds>.
