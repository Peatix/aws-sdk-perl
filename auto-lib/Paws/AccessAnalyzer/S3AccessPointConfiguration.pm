=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3AccessPointConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3AccessPointConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessPointPolicy => $value, ..., PublicAccessBlock => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3AccessPointConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessPointPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for an Amazon S3 access point or multi-region access
point for the bucket. You can propose up to 10 access points or
multi-region access points per bucket. If the proposed Amazon S3 access
point configuration is for an existing bucket, the access preview uses
the proposed access point configuration in place of the existing access
points. To propose an access point without a policy, you can provide an
empty string as the access point policy. For more information, see
Creating access points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/creating-access-points.html).
For more information about access point policy limits, see Access
points restrictions and limitations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-points-restrictions-limitations.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessPointPolicy => Str

The access point or multi-region access point policy.


=head2 NetworkOrigin => L<Paws::AccessAnalyzer::NetworkOriginConfiguration>

The proposed C<Internet> and C<VpcConfiguration> to apply to this
Amazon S3 access point. C<VpcConfiguration> does not apply to
multi-region access points. If the access preview is for a new resource
and neither is specified, the access preview uses C<Internet> for the
network origin. If the access preview is for an existing resource and
neither is specified, the access preview uses the existing network
origin.


=head2 PublicAccessBlock => L<Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3PublicAccessBlockConfiguration>

The proposed C<S3PublicAccessBlock> configuration to apply to this
Amazon S3 access point or multi-region access point.
