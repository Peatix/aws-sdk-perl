=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryBucketConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryBucketConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessPoints => $value, ..., BucketPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryBucketConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessPoints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Proposed access control configuration for an Amazon S3 directory
bucket. You can propose a configuration for a new Amazon S3 directory
bucket or an existing Amazon S3 directory bucket that you own by
specifying the Amazon S3 bucket policy. If the configuration is for an
existing Amazon S3 directory bucket and you do not specify the Amazon
S3 bucket policy, the access preview uses the existing policy attached
to the directory bucket. If the access preview is for a new resource
and you do not specify the Amazon S3 bucket policy, the access preview
assumes an directory bucket without a policy. To propose deletion of an
existing bucket policy, you can specify an empty string. For more
information about Amazon S3 directory bucket policies, see Example
bucket policies for directory buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-security-iam-example-bucket-policies.html)
in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
