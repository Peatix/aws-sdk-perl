=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::SqsQueueConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::SqsQueueConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { QueuePolicy => $value, ..., QueuePolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::SqsQueueConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->QueuePolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The proposed access control configuration for an Amazon SQS queue. You
can propose a configuration for a new Amazon SQS queue or an existing
Amazon SQS queue that you own by specifying the Amazon SQS policy. If
the configuration is for an existing Amazon SQS queue and you do not
specify the Amazon SQS policy, the access preview uses the existing
Amazon SQS policy for the queue. If the access preview is for a new
resource and you do not specify the policy, the access preview assumes
an Amazon SQS queue without a policy. To propose deletion of an
existing Amazon SQS queue policy, you can specify an empty string for
the Amazon SQS policy. For more information about Amazon SQS policy
limits, see Quotas related to policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/quotas-policies.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
