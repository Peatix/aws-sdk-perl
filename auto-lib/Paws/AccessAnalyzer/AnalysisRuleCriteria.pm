=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::AnalysisRuleCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::AnalysisRuleCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountIds => $value, ..., ResourceTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::AnalysisRuleCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The criteria for an analysis rule for an analyzer. The criteria
determine which entities will generate findings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs to apply to the analysis rule
criteria. The accounts cannot include the organization analyzer owner
account. Account IDs can only be applied to the analysis rule criteria
for organization-level analyzers. The list cannot include more than
2,000 account IDs.


=head2 ResourceTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AccessAnalyzer::TagsMap>]

An array of key-value pairs to match for your resources. You can use
the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, C<_>, C<.>, C</>, C<=>,
C<+>, and C<->.

For the tag key, you can specify a value that is 1 to 128 characters in
length and cannot be prefixed with C<aws:>.

For the tag value, you can specify a value that is 0 to 256 characters
in length. If the specified tag value is 0 characters, the rule is
applied to all principals with the specified tag key.
