=head1 NAME

Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryAccessPointConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryAccessPointConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessPointPolicy => $value, ..., NetworkOrigin => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AccessAnalyzer::S3ExpressDirectoryAccessPointConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessPointPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Proposed configuration for an access point attached to an Amazon S3
directory bucket. You can propose up to 10 access points per bucket. If
the proposed access point configuration is for an existing Amazon S3
directory bucket, the access preview uses the proposed access point
configuration in place of the existing access points. To propose an
access point without a policy, you can provide an empty string as the
access point policy. For more information about access points for
Amazon S3 directory buckets, see Managing access to directory buckets
with access points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-points-directory-buckets.html)
in the Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide.
