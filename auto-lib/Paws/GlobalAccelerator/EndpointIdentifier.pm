=head1 NAME

Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointIdentifier

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointIdentifier object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientIPPreservationEnabled => $value, ..., EndpointId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointIdentifier object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientIPPreservationEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type for an endpoint. Specifies information about the
endpoint to remove from the endpoint group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientIPPreservationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an
endpoint. The value is true or false.

If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in
the C<X-Forwarded-For> request header as traffic travels to
applications on the endpoint fronted by the accelerator.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndpointId => Str

An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or
Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the
Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the
EC2 instance ID.

An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.
