=head1 NAME

Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientIPPreservationEnabled => $value, ..., Weight => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlobalAccelerator::EndpointDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientIPPreservationEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can include one or
more endpoints, such as load balancers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientIPPreservationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an
endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for
Application Load Balancers endpoints.

If the value is set to true, the client's IP address is preserved in
the C<X-Forwarded-For> request header as traffic travels to
applications on the endpoint fronted by the accelerator.

Client IP address preservation is supported, in specific Amazon Web
Services Regions, for endpoints that are Application Load Balancers,
Amazon EC2 instances, and Network Load Balancers with security groups.
IMPORTANT: You cannot use client IP address preservation with Network
Load Balancers with TLS listeners.

For more information, see Preserve client IP addresses in Global
Accelerator
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/preserve-client-ip-address.html)
in the I<Global Accelerator Developer Guide>.


=head2 EndpointId => Str

An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or
Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the
Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the
EC2 instance ID.

An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.


=head2 HealthReason => Str

Returns a null result.


=head2 HealthState => Str

The health status of the endpoint.


=head2 Weight => Int

The weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to
endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to route traffic based on
proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint
weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your
traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed
both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last
endpoint. For more information, see Endpoint weights
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-endpoints-endpoint-weights.html)
in the I<Global Accelerator Developer Guide>.
