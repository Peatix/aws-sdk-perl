=head1 NAME

Paws::GlobalAccelerator::Accelerator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlobalAccelerator::Accelerator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceleratorArn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlobalAccelerator::Accelerator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceleratorArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An accelerator is a complex type that includes one or more listeners
that process inbound connections and then direct traffic to one or more
endpoint groups, each of which includes endpoints, such as load
balancers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcceleratorArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The date and time that the accelerator was created.


=head2 DnsName => Str

The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that
points to an accelerator's static IPv4 addresses.

The naming convention for the DNS name for an accelerator is the
following: A lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex
string, followed by .awsglobalaccelerator.com. For example:
a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

If you have a dual-stack accelerator, you also have a second DNS name,
C<DualStackDnsName>, that points to both the A record and the AAAA
record for all four static addresses for the accelerator: two IPv4
addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

For more information about the default DNS name, see Support for DNS
addressing in Global Accelerator
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/dns-addressing-custom-domains.dns-addressing.html)
in the I<Global Accelerator Developer Guide>.


=head2 DualStackDnsName => Str

The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global Accelerator creates that
points to a dual-stack accelerator's four static IP addresses: two IPv4
addresses and two IPv6 addresses.

The naming convention for the dual-stack DNS name is the following: A
lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random hex string, followed by
.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com. For example:
a1234567890abcdef.dualstack.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

Note: Global Accelerator also assigns a default DNS name, C<DnsName>,
to your accelerator that points just to the static IPv4 addresses.

For more information, see Support for DNS addressing in Global
Accelerator
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/about-accelerators.html#about-accelerators.dns-addressing)
in the I<Global Accelerator Developer Guide>.


=head2 Enabled => Bool

Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is true or
false. The default value is true.

If the value is set to true, the accelerator cannot be deleted. If set
to false, accelerator can be deleted.


=head2 Events => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlobalAccelerator::AcceleratorEvent>]

A history of changes that you make to an accelerator in Global
Accelerator.


=head2 IpAddressType => Str

The IP address type that an accelerator supports. For a standard
accelerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL_STACK.


=head2 IpSets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GlobalAccelerator::IpSet>]

The static IP addresses that Global Accelerator associates with the
accelerator.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the accelerator. The name must contain only alphanumeric
characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end with a hyphen.


=head2 Status => Str

Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.
