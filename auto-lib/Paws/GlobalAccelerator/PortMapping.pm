=head1 NAME

Paws::GlobalAccelerator::PortMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GlobalAccelerator::PortMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceleratorPort => $value, ..., Protocols => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GlobalAccelerator::PortMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceleratorPort

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns the ports and associated IP addresses and ports of Amazon EC2
instances in your virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets. Custom routing
is a port mapping protocol in Global Accelerator that statically
associates port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global
Accelerator to route to specific instances and ports within one or more
subnets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcceleratorPort => Int

The accelerator port.


=head2 DestinationSocketAddress => L<Paws::GlobalAccelerator::SocketAddress>

The EC2 instance IP address and port number in the virtual private
cloud (VPC) subnet.


=head2 DestinationTrafficState => Str

Indicates whether or not a port mapping destination can receive
traffic. The value is either ALLOW, if traffic is allowed to the
destination, or DENY, if traffic is not allowed to the destination.


=head2 EndpointGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.


=head2 EndpointId => Str

The IP address of the VPC subnet (the subnet ID).


=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The protocols supported by the endpoint group.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::GlobalAccelerator>
