=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::VpcConfigOutput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::VpcConfigOutput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Ipv6AllowedForDualStack => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::VpcConfigOutput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Ipv6AllowedForDualStack

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure contains
information about the subnets and security groups of the VPC endpoint.
For more information, see Running a Canary in a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Ipv6AllowedForDualStack => Bool

Indicates whether this canary allows outbound IPv6 traffic if it is
connected to dual-stack subnets.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the security groups for this canary.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the subnets where this canary is to run.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The IDs of the VPC where this canary is to run.
