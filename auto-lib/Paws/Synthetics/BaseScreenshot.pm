Paws::Synthetics::BaseScreenshot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::BaseScreenshot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IgnoreCoordinates => $value, ..., ScreenshotName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::BaseScreenshot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IgnoreCoordinates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure representing a screenshot that is used as a baseline during
visual monitoring comparisons made by the canary.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IgnoreCoordinates => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Coordinates that define the part of a screen to ignore during
screenshot comparisons. To obtain the coordinates to use here, use the
CloudWatch console to draw the boundaries on the screen. For more
information, see Editing or deleting a canary
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/synthetics_canaries_deletion.html)

is run after the C<UpdateCanary> operation that specified for this
canary to perform visual monitoring.
