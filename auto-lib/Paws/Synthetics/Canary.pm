=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::Canary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::Canary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ArtifactConfig => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::Canary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ArtifactConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains all information about one canary in your
account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ArtifactConfig => L<Paws::Synthetics::ArtifactConfigOutput>

A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts,
including the encryption-at-rest settings for artifacts that the canary
uploads to Amazon S3.


=head2 ArtifactS3Location => Str

The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the
runs of this canary. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots, and
HAR files.


=head2 Code => L<Paws::Synthetics::CanaryCodeOutput>




=head2 DryRunConfig => L<Paws::Synthetics::DryRunConfigOutput>

Returns the dry run configurations for a canary.


=head2 EngineArn => Str

The ARN of the Lambda function that is used as your canary's engine.
For more information about Lambda ARN format, see Resources and
Conditions for Lambda Actions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-api-permissions-ref.html).


=head2 ExecutionRoleArn => Str

The ARN of the IAM role used to run the canary. This role must include
C<lambda.amazonaws.com> as a principal in the trust policy.


=head2 FailureRetentionPeriodInDays => Int

The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary.

This setting affects the range of information returned by GetCanaryRuns
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html),
as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics
console.


=head2 Id => Str

The unique ID of this canary.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the canary.


=head2 ProvisionedResourceCleanup => Str

Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used
by this canary when the canary is deleted. If it is C<AUTOMATIC>, the
Lambda functions and layers will be deleted when the canary is deleted.

If the value of this parameter is C<OFF>, then the value of the
C<DeleteLambda> parameter of the DeleteCanary
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteCanary.html)
operation determines whether the Lambda functions and layers will be
deleted.


=head2 RunConfig => L<Paws::Synthetics::CanaryRunConfigOutput>




=head2 RuntimeVersion => Str

Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary. For more
information about runtime versions, see Canary Runtime Versions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html).


=head2 Schedule => L<Paws::Synthetics::CanaryScheduleOutput>

A structure that contains information about how often the canary is to
run, and when these runs are to stop.


=head2 Status => L<Paws::Synthetics::CanaryStatus>

A structure that contains information about the canary's status.


=head2 SuccessRetentionPeriodInDays => Int

The number of days to retain data about successful runs of this canary.

This setting affects the range of information returned by GetCanaryRuns
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_GetCanaryRuns.html),
as well as the range of information displayed in the Synthetics
console.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Synthetics::TagMap>

The list of key-value pairs that are associated with the canary.


=head2 Timeline => L<Paws::Synthetics::CanaryTimeline>

A structure that contains information about when the canary was
created, modified, and most recently run.


=head2 VisualReference => L<Paws::Synthetics::VisualReferenceOutput>

If this canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screenshots,
this structure contains the ID of the canary run to use as the baseline
for screenshots, and the coordinates of any parts of the screen to
ignore during the visual monitoring comparison.


=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::Synthetics::VpcConfigOutput>





=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Synthetics>
