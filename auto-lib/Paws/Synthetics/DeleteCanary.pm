=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::DeleteCanary - Arguments for method DeleteCanary on L<Paws::Synthetics>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteCanary on the
L<Synthetics|Paws::Synthetics> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteCanary.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteCanary.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $synthetics = Paws->service('Synthetics');
    my $DeleteCanaryResponse = $synthetics->DeleteCanary(
      Name         => 'MyCanaryName',
      DeleteLambda => 1,                # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/synthetics/DeleteCanary>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteLambda => Bool

Specifies whether to also delete the Lambda functions and layers used
by this canary. The default is C<false>.

Your setting for this parameter is used only if the canary doesn't have
C<AUTOMATIC> for its C<ProvisionedResourceCleanup> field. If that field
is set to C<AUTOMATIC>, then the Lambda functions and layers will be
deleted when this canary is deleted.

Type: Boolean



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the canary that you want to delete. To find the names of
your canaries, use DescribeCanaries
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCanaries.html).
