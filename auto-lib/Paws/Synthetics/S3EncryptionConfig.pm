=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::S3EncryptionConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::S3EncryptionConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptionMode => $value, ..., KmsKeyArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::S3EncryptionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptionMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the configuration of encryption-at-rest
settings for canary artifacts that the canary uploads to Amazon S3.

For more information, see Encrypting canary artifacts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_artifact_encryption.html)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EncryptionMode => Str

The encryption method to use for artifacts created by this canary.
Specify C<SSE_S3> to use server-side encryption (SSE) with an Amazon
S3-managed key. Specify C<SSE-KMS> to use server-side encryption with a
customer-managed KMS key.

If you omit this parameter, an Amazon Web Services-managed KMS key is
used.


=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The ARN of the customer-managed KMS key to use, if you specify
C<SSE-KMS> for C<EncryptionMode>
