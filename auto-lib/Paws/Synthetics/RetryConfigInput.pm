=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::RetryConfigInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::RetryConfigInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxRetries => $value, ..., MaxRetries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::RetryConfigInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxRetries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about the canary's retry
configuration.

The default account level concurrent execution limit from Lambda is
1000. When you have more than 1000 canaries, it's possible there are
more than 1000 Lambda invocations due to retries and the console might
hang. For more information on the Lambda execution limit, see
Understanding Lambda function scaling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-concurrency.html#:~:text=As%20your%20functions%20receive%20more,functions%20in%20an%20AWS%20Region).

For canary with C<MaxRetries = 2>, you need to set the
C<CanaryRunConfigInput.TimeoutInSeconds> to less than 600 seconds to
avoid validation errors.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxRetries => Int

The maximum number of retries. The value must be less than or equal to
2.
