=head1 NAME

Paws::Synthetics::VisualReferenceInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Synthetics::VisualReferenceInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseCanaryRunId => $value, ..., BaseScreenshots => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Synthetics::VisualReferenceInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseCanaryRunId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that specifies what screenshots to use as a baseline for
visual monitoring by this canary. It can optionally also specify parts
of the screenshots to ignore during the visual monitoring comparison.

Visual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the
B<syn-puppeteer-node-3.2> runtime or later. For more information, see
Visual monitoring
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Library_SyntheticsLogger_VisualTesting.html)
and Visual monitoring blueprint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Blueprints_VisualTesting.html)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BaseCanaryRunId => Str

Specifies which canary run to use the screenshots from as the baseline
for future visual monitoring with this canary. Valid values are
C<nextrun> to use the screenshots from the next run after this update
is made, C<lastrun> to use the screenshots from the most recent run
before this update was made, or the value of C<Id> in the CanaryRun
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonSynthetics/latest/APIReference/API_CanaryRun.html)
from a run of this a canary in the past 31 days. If you specify the
C<Id> of a canary run older than 31 days, the operation returns a 400
validation exception error..


=head2 BaseScreenshots => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Synthetics::BaseScreenshot>]

An array of screenshots that will be used as the baseline for visual
monitoring in future runs of this canary. If there is a screenshot that
you don't want to be used for visual monitoring, remove it from this
array.
