=head1 NAME

Paws::IAM::PasswordPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IAM::PasswordPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowUsersToChangePassword => $value, ..., RequireUppercaseCharacters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IAM::PasswordPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowUsersToChangePassword

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the account password policy.

This data type is used as a response element in the
GetAccountPasswordPolicy operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowUsersToChangePassword => Bool

Specifies whether IAM users are allowed to change their own password.
Gives IAM users permissions to C<iam:ChangePassword> for only their
user and to the C<iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy> action. This option
does not attach a permissions policy to each user, rather the
permissions are applied at the account-level for all users by IAM.


=head2 ExpirePasswords => Bool

Indicates whether passwords in the account expire. Returns true if
C<MaxPasswordAge> contains a value greater than 0. Returns false if
MaxPasswordAge is 0 or not present.


=head2 HardExpiry => Bool

Specifies whether IAM users are prevented from setting a new password
via the Amazon Web Services Management Console after their password has
expired. The IAM user cannot access the console until an administrator
resets the password. IAM users with C<iam:ChangePassword> permission
and active access keys can reset their own expired console password
using the CLI or API.


=head2 MaxPasswordAge => Int

The number of days that an IAM user password is valid.


=head2 MinimumPasswordLength => Int

Minimum length to require for IAM user passwords.


=head2 PasswordReusePrevention => Int

Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented
from reusing.


=head2 RequireLowercaseCharacters => Bool

Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one
lowercase character (a to z).


=head2 RequireNumbers => Bool

Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric
character (0 to 9).


=head2 RequireSymbols => Bool

Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one of the
following symbols:

! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | '


=head2 RequireUppercaseCharacters => Bool

Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one
uppercase character (A to Z).
