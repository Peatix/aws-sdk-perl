    my $iam = Paws->service('IAM');
    # To generate a service last accessed data report for a policy
    # The following operation generates a report for the policy: ExamplePolicy1
    my $GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetailsResponse =
      $iam->GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails(
      'Arn' => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:policy/ExamplePolicy1' );

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The ARN of the IAM resource (user, group, role, or managed policy) used
to generate information about when the resource was last used in an
attempt to access an Amazon Web Services service.



=head2 Granularity => Str

The level of detail that you want to generate. You can specify whether
you want to generate information about the last attempt to access
services or actions. If you specify service-level granularity, this
operation generates only service data. If you specify action-level
granularity, it generates service and action data. If you don't include
this optional parameter, the operation generates service data.

Valid values are: C<"SERVICE_LEVEL">, C<"ACTION_LEVEL">
