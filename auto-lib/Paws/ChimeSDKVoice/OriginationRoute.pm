=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKVoice::OriginationRoute

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKVoice::OriginationRoute object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Host => $value, ..., Weight => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKVoice::OriginationRoute object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Host

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Origination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP
hosts to receive inbound calls using an Amazon Chime SDK Voice
Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Voice Connector.

The parameters listed below are not required, but you must use at least
one.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Host => Str

The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.


=head2 Port => Int

The designated origination route port. Defaults to 5060.


=head2 Priority => Int

The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest
priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.


=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled
Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.


=head2 Weight => Int

The weight assigned to an origination route. When hosts have equal
priority, calls are distributed between them based on their relative
weights.
