=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Resolver::Filter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53Resolver::Filter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53Resolver::Filter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For Resolver list operations (ListResolverEndpoints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html),
ListResolverRules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html),
ListResolverRuleAssociations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html),
ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html),
ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html)),
and ListResolverDnssecConfigs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverDnssecConfigs.html)),
an optional specification to return a subset of objects.

To filter objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver rules, you
specify C<Name> and C<Values>. For example, to list only inbound
Resolver endpoints, specify C<Direction> for C<Name> and specify
C<INBOUND> for C<Values>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the parameter that you want to use to filter objects.

The valid values for C<Name> depend on the action that you're including
the filter in, ListResolverEndpoints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverEndpoints.html),
ListResolverRules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html),
ListResolverRuleAssociations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRuleAssociations.html),
ListResolverQueryLogConfigs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.html),
or ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverQueryLogConfigAssociations.html).

In early versions of Resolver, values for C<Name> were listed as
uppercase, with underscore (_) delimiters. For example,
C<CreatorRequestId> was originally listed as C<CREATOR_REQUEST_ID>.
Uppercase values for C<Name> are still supported.

B<ListResolverEndpoints>

Valid values for C<Name> include the following:

=over

=item *

C<CreatorRequestId>: The value that you specified when you created the
Resolver endpoint.

=item *

C<Direction>: Whether you want to return inbound or outbound Resolver
endpoints. If you specify C<DIRECTION> for C<Name>, specify C<INBOUND>
or C<OUTBOUND> for C<Values>.

=item *

C<HostVPCId>: The ID of the VPC that inbound DNS queries pass through
on the way from your network to your VPCs in a region, or the VPC that
outbound queries pass through on the way from your VPCs to your
network. In a CreateResolverEndpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverEndpoint.html)
request, C<SubnetId> indirectly identifies the VPC. In a
GetResolverEndpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverEndpoint.html)
request, the VPC ID for a Resolver endpoint is returned in the
C<HostVPCId> element.

=item *

C<IpAddressCount>: The number of IP addresses that you have associated
with the Resolver endpoint.

=item *

C<Name>: The name of the Resolver endpoint.

=item *

C<SecurityGroupIds>: The IDs of the VPC security groups that you
specified when you created the Resolver endpoint.

=item *

C<Status>: The status of the Resolver endpoint. If you specify
C<Status> for C<Name>, specify one of the following status codes for
C<Values>: C<CREATING>, C<OPERATIONAL>, C<UPDATING>,
C<AUTO_RECOVERING>, C<ACTION_NEEDED>, or C<DELETING>. For more
information, see C<Status> in ResolverEndpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ResolverEndpoint.html).

=back

B<ListResolverRules>

Valid values for C<Name> include the following:

=over

=item *

C<CreatorRequestId>: The value that you specified when you created the
Resolver rule.

=item *

C<DomainName>: The domain name for which Resolver is forwarding DNS
queries to your network. In the value that you specify for C<Values>,
include a trailing dot (.) after the domain name. For example, if the
domain name is example.com, specify the following value. Note the "."
after C<com>:

C<example.com.>

=item *

C<Name>: The name of the Resolver rule.

=item *

C<ResolverEndpointId>: The ID of the Resolver endpoint that the
Resolver rule is associated with.

You can filter on the Resolver endpoint only for rules that have a
value of C<FORWARD> for C<RuleType>.

=item *

C<Status>: The status of the Resolver rule. If you specify C<Status>
for C<Name>, specify one of the following status codes for C<Values>:
C<COMPLETE>, C<DELETING>, C<UPDATING>, or C<FAILED>.

=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

When you're using a C<List> operation and you want the operation to
return a subset of objects, such as Resolver endpoints or Resolver
rules, the value of the parameter that you want to use to filter
objects. For example, to list only inbound Resolver endpoints, specify
C<Direction> for C<Name> and specify C<INBOUND> for C<Values>.
