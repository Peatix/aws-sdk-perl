=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Resolver::CreateResolverQueryLogConfig - Arguments for method CreateResolverQueryLogConfig on L<Paws::Route53Resolver>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateResolverQueryLogConfig on the
L<Amazon Route 53 Resolver|Paws::Route53Resolver> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateResolverQueryLogConfig.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateResolverQueryLogConfig.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $route53resolver = Paws->service('Route53Resolver');
    my $CreateResolverQueryLogConfigResponse =
      $route53resolver->CreateResolverQueryLogConfig(
      CreatorRequestId => 'MyCreatorRequestId',
      DestinationArn   => 'MyDestinationArn',
      Name             => 'MyResolverQueryLogConfigName',
      Tags             => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $ResolverQueryLogConfig =
      $CreateResolverQueryLogConfigResponse->ResolverQueryLogConfig;

# Returns a L<Paws::Route53Resolver::CreateResolverQueryLogConfigResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatorRequestId => Str

A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed

C<CreatorRequestId> can be any unique string, for example, a date/time
stamp.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationArn => Str

The ARN of the resource that you want Resolver to send query logs. You

B<S3 bucket>:

C<arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket>

You can optionally append a file prefix to the end of the ARN.

C<arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/development/>

=item *

B<CloudWatch Logs log group>:

C<arn:aws:logs:us-west-1:123456789012:log-group:/mystack-testgroup-12ABC1AB12A1:*>

=item *
