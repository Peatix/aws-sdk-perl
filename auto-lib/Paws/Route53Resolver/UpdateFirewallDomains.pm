=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateFirewallDomains on the
L<Amazon Route 53 Resolver|Paws::Route53Resolver> service. Use the attributes of this class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $route53resolver = Paws->service('Route53Resolver');
    my $UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse = $route53resolver->UpdateFirewallDomains(
      Domains => [
        'MyFirewallDomainName', ...    # min: 1, max: 255
      ],
      FirewallDomainListId => 'MyResourceId',
      Operation            => 'ADD',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Id            = $UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse->Id;
    my $Name          = $UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse->Name;
    my $Status        = $UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse->Status;
    my $StatusMessage = $UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse->StatusMessage;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Route53Resolver::UpdateFirewallDomainsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
