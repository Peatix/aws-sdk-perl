=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Resolver::ListResolverQueryLogConfigs - Arguments for method ListResolverQueryLogConfigs on L<Paws::Route53Resolver>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListResolverQueryLogConfigs on the
L<Amazon Route 53 Resolver|Paws::Route53Resolver> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListResolverQueryLogConfigs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $route53resolver = Paws->service('Route53Resolver');
    my $ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse =
      $route53resolver->ListResolverQueryLogConfigs(
      Filters => [
        {
          Name   => 'MyFilterName',    # min: 1, max: 64; OPTIONAL
          Values => [
            'MyFilterValue', ...       # min: 1, max: 600
          ],    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
      SortBy     => 'MySortByKey',    # OPTIONAL
      SortOrder  => 'ASCENDING',      # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken = $ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse->NextToken;
    my $ResolverQueryLogConfigs =
      $ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse->ResolverQueryLogConfigs;
    my $TotalCount = $ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse->TotalCount;
    my $TotalFilteredCount =
      $ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse->TotalFilteredCount;

# Returns a L<Paws::Route53Resolver::ListResolverQueryLogConfigsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Route53Resolver::Filter>]

An optional specification to return a subset of query logging
configurations.

If you submit a second or subsequent C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs>
request and specify the C<NextToken> parameter, you must use the same
values for C<Filters>, if any, as in the previous request.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of query logging configurations that you want to
return in the response to a C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs> request. If
you don't specify a value for C<MaxResults>, Resolver returns up to 100
query logging configurations.



=head2 NextToken => Str

For the first C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs> request, omit this value.

If there are more than C<MaxResults> query logging configurations that
match the values that you specify for C<Filters>, you can submit
another C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs> request to get the next group of
configurations. In the next request, specify the value of C<NextToken>
from the previous response.



=head2 SortBy => Str

The element that you want Resolver to sort query logging configurations
by.

If you submit a second or subsequent C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs>
request and specify the C<NextToken> parameter, you must use the same
value for C<SortBy>, if any, as in the previous request.

Valid values include the following elements:

=over

=item *

C<Arn>: The ARN of the query logging configuration

=item *

C<AssociationCount>: The number of VPCs that are associated with the
specified configuration

=item *

C<CreationTime>: The date and time that Resolver returned when the
configuration was created

=item *

C<CreatorRequestId>: The value that was specified for
C<CreatorRequestId> when the configuration was created

=item *

C<DestinationArn>: The location that logs are sent to

=item *

C<Id>: The ID of the configuration

=item *

C<Name>: The name of the configuration

=item *

C<OwnerId>: The Amazon Web Services account number of the account that
created the configuration

=item *

C<ShareStatus>: Whether the configuration is shared with other Amazon
Web Services accounts or shared with the current account by another
Amazon Web Services account. Sharing is configured through Resource
Access Manager (RAM).

=item *

C<Status>: The current status of the configuration. Valid values
include the following:

=over

=item *

C<CREATING>: Resolver is creating the query logging configuration.

=item *

C<CREATED>: The query logging configuration was successfully created.
Resolver is logging queries that originate in the specified VPC.

=item *

C<DELETING>: Resolver is deleting this query logging configuration.

=item *

C<FAILED>: Resolver either couldn't create or couldn't delete the query
logging configuration. Here are two common causes:

=over

=item *

The specified destination (for example, an Amazon S3 bucket) was
deleted.

=item *

Permissions don't allow sending logs to the destination.

=head2 SortOrder => Str

If you specified a value for C<SortBy>, the order that you want query
logging configurations to be listed in, C<ASCENDING> or C<DESCENDING>.

If you submit a second or subsequent C<ListResolverQueryLogConfigs>
request and specify the C<NextToken> parameter, you must use the same
value for C<SortOrder>, if any, as in the previous request.

Valid values are: C<"ASCENDING">, C<"DESCENDING">
