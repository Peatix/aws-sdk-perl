=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $route53resolver = Paws->service('Route53Resolver');
    my $UpdateResolverDnssecConfigResponse =
      $route53resolver->UpdateResolverDnssecConfig(
      ResourceId => 'MyResourceId',
      Validation => 'ENABLE',

      );

    # Results:
    my $ResolverDNSSECConfig =
      $UpdateResolverDnssecConfigResponse->ResolverDNSSECConfig;

# Returns a L<Paws::Route53Resolver::UpdateResolverDnssecConfigResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
