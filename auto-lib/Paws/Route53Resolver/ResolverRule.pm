=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Resolver::ResolverRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53Resolver::ResolverRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., TargetIps => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53Resolver::ResolverRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For queries that originate in your VPC, detailed information about a
Resolver rule, which specifies how to route DNS queries out of the VPC.
The C<ResolverRule> parameter appears in the response to a
CreateResolverRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_CreateResolverRule.html),
DeleteResolverRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_DeleteResolverRule.html),
GetResolverRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_GetResolverRule.html),
ListResolverRules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_ListResolverRules.html),
or UpdateResolverRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_route53resolver_UpdateResolverRule.html)
request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the Resolver rule specified by
C<Id>.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The date and time that the Resolver rule was created, in Unix time
format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


=head2 CreatorRequestId => Str

A unique string that you specified when you created the Resolver rule.
C<CreatorRequestId> identifies the request and allows failed requests
to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.


=head2 DomainName => Str

DNS queries for this domain name are forwarded to the IP addresses that
are specified in C<TargetIps>. If a query matches multiple Resolver
rules (example.com and www.example.com), the query is routed using the
Resolver rule that contains the most specific domain name
(www.example.com).


=head2 Id => Str

The ID that Resolver assigned to the Resolver rule when you created it.


=head2 ModificationTime => Str

The date and time that the Resolver rule was last updated, in Unix time
format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


=head2 Name => Str

The name for the Resolver rule, which you specified when you created
the Resolver rule.


=head2 OwnerId => Str

When a rule is shared with another Amazon Web Services account, the
account ID of the account that the rule is shared with.


=head2 ResolverEndpointId => Str

The ID of the endpoint that the rule is associated with.


=head2 RuleType => Str

When you want to forward DNS queries for specified domain name to
resolvers on your network, specify C<FORWARD>.

When you have a forwarding rule to forward DNS queries for a domain to
your network and you want Resolver to process queries for a subdomain
of that domain, specify C<SYSTEM>.

For example, to forward DNS queries for example.com to resolvers on
your network, you create a rule and specify C<FORWARD> for C<RuleType>.
To then have Resolver process queries for apex.example.com, you create
a rule and specify C<SYSTEM> for C<RuleType>.

Currently, only Resolver can create rules that have a value of
C<RECURSIVE> for C<RuleType>.


=head2 ShareStatus => Str

Whether the rule is shared and, if so, whether the current account is
sharing the rule with another account, or another account is sharing
the rule with the current account.


=head2 Status => Str

A code that specifies the current status of the Resolver rule.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A detailed description of the status of a Resolver rule.


=head2 TargetIps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Route53Resolver::TargetAddress>]

An array that contains the IP addresses and ports that an outbound
endpoint forwards DNS queries to. Typically, these are the IP addresses
of DNS resolvers on your network.
