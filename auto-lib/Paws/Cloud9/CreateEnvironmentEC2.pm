=head1 NAME

Paws::Cloud9::CreateEnvironmentEC2 - Arguments for method CreateEnvironmentEC2 on L<Paws::Cloud9>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateEnvironmentEC2 on the
L<AWS Cloud9|Paws::Cloud9> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateEnvironmentEC2.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateEnvironmentEC2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloud9 = Paws->service('Cloud9');
    # CreateEnvironmentEC2
    my $CreateEnvironmentEC2Result = $cloud9->CreateEnvironmentEC2(
      'AutomaticStopTimeMinutes' => 60,
      'Description'              => 'This is my demonstration environment.',
      'InstanceType'             => 't2.micro',
      'Name'                     => 'my-demo-environment',
      'OwnerArn'                 => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/MyDemoUser',
      'SubnetId'                 => 'subnet-6300cd1b'
    );

    # Results:
    my $environmentId = $CreateEnvironmentEC2Result->environmentId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Cloud9::CreateEnvironmentEC2Result> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloud9/CreateEnvironmentEC2>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutomaticStopTimeMinutes => Int

The number of minutes until the running instance is shut down after the
environment has last been used.



=head2 ClientRequestToken => Str

A unique, case-sensitive string that helps Cloud9 to ensure this
operation completes no more than one time.

For more information, see Client Tokens
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 API Reference>.



=head2 ConnectionType => Str

The connection type used for connecting to an Amazon EC2 environment.
Valid values are C<CONNECT_SSH> (default) and C<CONNECT_SSM> (connected
through Amazon EC2 Systems Manager).

For more information, see Accessing no-ingress EC2 instances with
Amazon EC2 Systems Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/ec2-ssm.html) in
the I<Cloud9 User Guide>.

Valid values are: C<"CONNECT_SSH">, C<"CONNECT_SSM">

=head2 Description => Str

The description of the environment to create.



=head2 DryRun => Bool

Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If
you have the required permissions, the error response is
C<DryRunOperation>. Otherwise, it is C<UnauthorizedOperation>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImageId => Str

The identifier for the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that's used to create
the EC2 instance. To choose an AMI for the instance, you must specify a
valid AMI alias or a valid Amazon EC2 Systems Manager (SSM) path.

We recommend using Amazon Linux 2023 as the AMI to create your
environment as it is fully supported.

From December 16, 2024, Ubuntu 18.04 will be removed from the list of
available C<imageIds> for Cloud9. This change is necessary as Ubuntu
18.04 has ended standard support on May 31, 2023. This change will only
affect direct API consumers, and not Cloud9 console users.

Since Ubuntu 18.04 has ended standard support as of May 31, 2023, we
recommend you choose Ubuntu 22.04.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The type of instance to connect to the environment (for example,
C<t2.micro>).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the environment to create.

This name is visible to other IAM users in the same Amazon Web Services
account.



=head2 OwnerArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the environment owner. This ARN can
be the ARN of any IAM principal. If this value is not specified, the
ARN defaults to this environment's creator.



=head2 SubnetId => Str

The ID of the subnet in Amazon VPC that Cloud9 will use to communicate
with the Amazon EC2 instance.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Cloud9::Tag>]

An array of key-value pairs that will be associated with the new Cloud9
development environment.
