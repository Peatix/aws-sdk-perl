=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeCommit::PutCommentReaction - Arguments for method PutCommentReaction on L<Paws::CodeCommit>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutCommentReaction on the
L<AWS CodeCommit|Paws::CodeCommit> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutCommentReaction.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutCommentReaction.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codecommit = Paws->service('CodeCommit');
    $codecommit->PutCommentReaction(
      CommentId     => 'MyCommentId',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
