=head1 NAME

Paws::ServiceDiscovery::Service

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ServiceDiscovery::Service object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ServiceDiscovery::Service object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that contains information about the specified service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Cloud Map assigns to the service
when you create it.


=head2 CreateDate => Str

The date and time that the service was created, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreateDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value C<1516925490.087>
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CreatorRequestId => Str

A unique string that identifies the request and that allows failed
requests to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice.
C<CreatorRequestId> can be any unique string (for example, a
date/timestamp).


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the service.


=head2 DnsConfig => L<Paws::ServiceDiscovery::DnsConfig>

A complex type that contains information about the Route 53 DNS records
that you want Cloud Map to create when you register an instance.

The record types of a service can only be changed by deleting the
service and recreating it with a new C<Dnsconfig>.


=head2 HealthCheckConfig => L<Paws::ServiceDiscovery::HealthCheckConfig>

I<Public DNS and HTTP namespaces only.> A complex type that contains
settings for an optional health check. If you specify settings for a
health check, Cloud Map associates the health check with the records
that you specify in C<DnsConfig>.

For information about the charges for health checks, see Amazon Route
53 Pricing (http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/).


=head2 HealthCheckCustomConfig => L<Paws::ServiceDiscovery::HealthCheckCustomConfig>

A complex type that contains information about an optional custom
health check.

If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either
C<HealthCheckCustomConfig> or C<HealthCheckConfig> but not both.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID that Cloud Map assigned to the service when you created it.


=head2 InstanceCount => Int

The number of instances that are currently associated with the service.
Instances that were previously associated with the service but that are
deleted aren't included in the count. The count might not reflect
pending registrations and deregistrations.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the service.


=head2 NamespaceId => Str

The ID of the namespace that was used to create the service.


=head2 Type => Str

Describes the systems that can be used to discover the service
instances.

=over

=item DNS_HTTP

The service instances can be discovered using either DNS queries or the
C<DiscoverInstances> API operation.

=item HTTP

The service instances can only be discovered using the
C<DiscoverInstances> API operation.

=item DNS

Reserved.
