=head1 NAME

Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceFinderEnablement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceFinderEnablement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BackfillStatus => $value, ..., EventDataStoreArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceFinderEnablement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BackfillStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings object that specifies whether evidence finder is enabled.
This object also describes the related event data store, and the
backfill status for populating the event data store with evidence data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BackfillStatus => Str

The current status of the evidence data backfill process.

The backfill starts after you enable evidence finder. During this task,
Audit Manager populates an event data store with your past two
yearsE<rsquo> worth of evidence data so that your evidence can be
queried.

=over

=item *

C<NOT_STARTED> means that the backfill hasnE<rsquo>t started yet.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> means that the backfill is in progress. This can take up
to 7 days to complete, depending on the amount of evidence data.

=item *

C<COMPLETED> means that the backfill is complete. All of your past
evidence is now queryable.

=back



=head2 EnablementStatus => Str

The current status of the evidence finder feature and the related event
data store.

=over

=item *

C<ENABLE_IN_PROGRESS> means that you requested to enable evidence
finder. An event data store is currently being created to support
evidence finder queries.

=item *

C<ENABLED> means that an event data store was successfully created and
evidence finder is enabled. We recommend that you wait 7 days until the
event data store is backfilled with your past two yearsE<rsquo> worth
of evidence data. You can use evidence finder in the meantime, but not
all data might be available until the backfill is complete.

=item *

C<DISABLE_IN_PROGRESS> means that you requested to disable evidence
finder, and your request is pending the deletion of the event data
store.

=item *

C<DISABLED> means that you have permanently disabled evidence finder
and the event data store has been deleted. You can't re-enable evidence
finder after this point.

=back



=head2 Error => Str

Represents any errors that occurred when enabling or disabling evidence
finder.


=head2 EventDataStoreArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudTrail Lake event data store
thatE<rsquo>s used by evidence finder. The event data store is the lake
of evidence data that evidence finder runs queries against.
