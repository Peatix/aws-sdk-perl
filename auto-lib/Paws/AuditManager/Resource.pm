=head1 NAME

Paws::AuditManager::Resource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AuditManager::Resource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AuditManager::Resource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A system asset that's evaluated in an Audit Manager assessment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.


=head2 ComplianceCheck => Str

The evaluation status for a resource that was assessed when collecting
compliance check evidence.

=over

=item *

Audit Manager classes the resource as non-compliant if Security Hub
reports a I<Fail> result, or if Config reports a I<Non-compliant>
result.

=item *

Audit Manager classes the resource as compliant if Security Hub reports
a I<Pass> result, or if Config reports a I<Compliant> result.

=item *

If a compliance check isn't available or applicable, then no compliance
evaluation can be made for that resource. This is the case if a
resource assessment uses Config or Security Hub as the underlying data
source type, but those services aren't enabled. This is also the case
if the resource assessment uses an underlying data source type that
doesn't support compliance checks (such as manual evidence, Amazon Web
Services API calls, or CloudTrail).

=back



=head2 Value => Str

The value of the resource.
