=head1 NAME

Paws::AuditManager::Evidence

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AuditManager::Evidence object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssessmentReportSelection => $value, ..., Time => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AuditManager::Evidence object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssessmentReportSelection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A record that contains the information needed to demonstrate compliance
with the requirements specified by a control. Examples of evidence
include change activity invoked by a user, or a system configuration
snapshot.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssessmentReportSelection => Str

Specifies whether the evidence is included in the assessment report.


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceAttributes>

The names and values that are used by the evidence event. This includes
an attribute name (such as C<allowUsersToChangePassword>) and value
(such as C<true> or C<false>).


=head2 AwsAccountId => Str

The identifier for the Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 AwsOrganization => Str

The Amazon Web Services account that the evidence is collected from,
and its organization path.


=head2 ComplianceCheck => Str

The evaluation status for automated evidence that falls under the
compliance check category.

=over

=item *

Audit Manager classes evidence as non-compliant if Security Hub reports
a I<Fail> result, or if Config reports a I<Non-compliant> result.

=item *

Audit Manager classes evidence as compliant if Security Hub reports a
I<Pass> result, or if Config reports a I<Compliant> result.

=item *

If a compliance check isn't available or applicable, then no compliance
evaluation can be made for that evidence. This is the case if the
evidence uses Config or Security Hub as the underlying data source
type, but those services aren't enabled. This is also the case if the
evidence uses an underlying data source type that doesn't support
compliance checks (such as manual evidence, Amazon Web Services API
calls, or CloudTrail).

=back



=head2 DataSource => Str

The data source where the evidence was collected from.


=head2 EventName => Str

The name of the evidence event.


=head2 EventSource => Str

The Amazon Web Service that the evidence is collected from.
