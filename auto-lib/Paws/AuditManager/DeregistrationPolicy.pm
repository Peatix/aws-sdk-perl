=head1 NAME

Paws::AuditManager::DeregistrationPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AuditManager::DeregistrationPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteResources => $value, ..., DeleteResources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AuditManager::DeregistrationPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteResources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The deregistration policy for the data that's stored in Audit Manager.
You can use this attribute to determine how your data is handled when
you deregister Audit Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterAccount.html).

By default, Audit Manager retains evidence data for two years from the
time of its creation. Other Audit Manager resources (including
assessments, custom controls, and custom frameworks) remain in Audit
Manager indefinitely, and are available if you re-register Audit
Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterAccount.html)
in the future. For more information about data retention, see Data
Protection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/data-protection.html)
in the I<Audit Manager User Guide>.

If you choose to delete all data, this action permanently deletes all
evidence data in your account within seven days. It also deletes all of
the Audit Manager resources that you created, including assessments,
custom controls, and custom frameworks. Your data will not be available
if you re-register Audit Manager in the future.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteResources => Str

Specifies which Audit Manager data will be deleted when you deregister
Audit Manager.

=over

=item *

If you set the value to C<ALL>, all of your data is deleted within
seven days of deregistration.

=item *

If you set the value to C<DEFAULT>, none of your data is deleted at the
time of deregistration. However, keep in mind that the Audit Manager
data retention policy still applies. As a result, any evidence data
will be deleted two years after its creation date. Your other Audit
Manager resources will continue to exist indefinitely.
