=head1 NAME

Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceInsights

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceInsights object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompliantEvidenceCount => $value, ..., NoncompliantEvidenceCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AuditManager::EvidenceInsights object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompliantEvidenceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A breakdown of the latest compliance check status for the evidence in
your Audit Manager assessments.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompliantEvidenceCount => Int

The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified
as compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from Security
Hub with a I<Pass> ruling, or collected from Config with a I<Compliant>
ruling.


=head2 InconclusiveEvidenceCount => Int

The number of evidence that a compliance check ruling isn't available
for. Evidence is inconclusive when the associated control uses Security
Hub or Config as a data source but you didn't enable those services.
This is also the case when a control uses a data source that
doesnE<rsquo>t support compliance checks (for example, manual evidence,
API calls, or CloudTrail).

If evidence has a compliance check status of I<not applicable> in the
console, it's classified as I<inconclusive> in C<EvidenceInsights>
data.


=head2 NoncompliantEvidenceCount => Int

The number of compliance check evidence that Audit Manager classified
as non-compliant. This includes evidence that was collected from
Security Hub with a I<Fail> ruling, or collected from Config with a
I<Non-compliant> ruling.
