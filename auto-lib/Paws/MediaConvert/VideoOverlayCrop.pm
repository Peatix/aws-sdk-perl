=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayCrop

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayCrop object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., Y => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayCrop object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify a rectangle of content to crop and use from your video
overlay's input video. When you do, MediaConvert uses the cropped
dimensions that you specify under X offset, Y offset, Width, and
Height.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Height => Int

Specify the height of the video overlay cropping rectangle. To use the
same height as your overlay input video: Keep blank, or enter 0. To
specify a different height for the cropping rectangle: Enter an integer
representing the Unit type that you choose, either Pixels or
Percentage. For example, when you enter 100 and choose Pixels, the
cropping rectangle will 100 pixels high. When you enter 10, choose
Percentage, and your overlay input video is 1920x1080, the cropping
rectangle will be 108 pixels high.


=head2 Unit => Str

Specify the Unit type to use when you enter a value for X position, Y
position, Width, or Height. You can choose Pixels or Percentage. Leave
blank to use the default value, Pixels.


=head2 Width => Int

Specify the width of the video overlay cropping rectangle. To use the
same width as your overlay input video: Keep blank, or enter 0. To
specify a different width for the cropping rectangle: Enter an integer
representing the Unit type that you choose, either Pixels or
Percentage. For example, when you enter 100 and choose Pixels, the
cropping rectangle will 100 pixels wide. When you enter 10, choose
Percentage, and your overlay input video is 1920x1080, the cropping
rectangle will be 192 pixels wide.


=head2 X => Int

Specify the distance between the cropping rectangle and the left edge
of your overlay video's frame. To position the cropping rectangle along
the left edge: Keep blank, or enter 0. To position the cropping
rectangle to the right, relative to the left edge of your overlay
video's frame: Enter an integer representing the Unit type that you
choose, either Pixels or Percentage. For example, when you enter 10 and
choose Pixels, the cropping rectangle will be positioned 10 pixels from
the left edge of the overlay video's frame. When you enter 10, choose
Percentage, and your overlay input video is 1920x1080, the cropping
rectangle will be positioned 192 pixels from the left edge of the
overlay video's frame.


=head2 Y => Int

Specify the distance between the cropping rectangle and the top edge of
your overlay video's frame. To position the cropping rectangle along
the top edge: Keep blank, or enter 0. To position the cropping
rectangle down, relative to the top edge of your overlay video's frame:
Enter an integer representing the Unit type that you choose, either
Pixels or Percentage. For example, when you enter 10 and choose Pixels,
the cropping rectangle will be positioned 10 pixels from the top edge
of the overlay video's frame. When you enter 10, choose Percentage, and
your overlay input video is 1920x1080, the cropping rectangle will be
positioned 108 pixels from the top edge of the overlay video's frame.
