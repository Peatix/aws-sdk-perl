=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::OutputGroupSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::OutputGroupSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CmafGroupSettings => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::OutputGroupSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CmafGroupSettings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Output Group settings, including type

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CmafGroupSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::CmafGroupSettings>

Settings related to your CMAF output package. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.


=head2 DashIsoGroupSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::DashIsoGroupSettings>

Settings related to your DASH output package. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.


=head2 FileGroupSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::FileGroupSettings>

Settings related to your File output group. MediaConvert uses this
group of settings to generate a single standalone file, rather than a
streaming package.


=head2 HlsGroupSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::HlsGroupSettings>

Settings related to your HLS output package. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.


=head2 MsSmoothGroupSettings => L<Paws::MediaConvert::MsSmoothGroupSettings>

Settings related to your Microsoft Smooth Streaming output package. For
more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.


=head2 PerFrameMetrics => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Optionally choose one or more per frame metric reports to generate
along with your output. You can use these metrics to analyze your video
output according to one or more commonly used image quality metrics.
You can specify per frame metrics for output groups or for individual
outputs. When you do, MediaConvert writes a CSV (Comma-Separated
Values) file to your S3 output destination, named after the output name
and metric type. For example: videofile_PSNR.csv Jobs that generate per
frame metrics will take longer to complete, depending on the resolution
and complexity of your output. For example, some 4K jobs might take up
to twice as long to complete. Note that when analyzing the video
quality of your output, or when comparing the video quality of multiple
different outputs, we generally also recommend a detailed visual review
in a controlled environment. You can choose from the following per
frame metrics: * PSNR: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio * SSIM: Structural
Similarity Index Measure * MS_SSIM: Multi-Scale Similarity Index
Measure * PSNR_HVS: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, Human Visual System *
VMAF: Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion * QVBR: Quality-Defined
Variable Bitrate. This option is only available when your output uses
the QVBR rate control mode.


=head2 Type => Str

Type of output group (File group, Apple HLS, DASH ISO, Microsoft Smooth
Streaming, CMAF)
