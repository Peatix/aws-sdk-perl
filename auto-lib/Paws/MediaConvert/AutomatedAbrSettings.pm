=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxAbrBitrate => $value, ..., Rules => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxAbrBitrate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up the renditions in your
ABR package for you automatically, based on characteristics of your
input video. This feature optimizes video quality while minimizing the
overall size of your ABR package.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxAbrBitrate => Int

Specify the maximum average bitrate for MediaConvert to use in your
automated ABR stack. If you don't specify a value, MediaConvert uses
8,000,000 (8 mb/s) by default. The average bitrate of your
highest-quality rendition will be equal to or below this value,
depending on the quality, complexity, and resolution of your content.
Note that the instantaneous maximum bitrate may vary above the value
that you specify.


=head2 MaxQualityLevel => Num

Optional. Specify the QVBR quality level to use for all renditions in
your automated ABR stack. To have MediaConvert automatically determine
the quality level: Leave blank. To manually specify a quality level:
Enter a value from 1 to 10. MediaConvert will use a quality level up to
the value that you specify, depending on your source. For more
information about QVBR quality levels, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/qvbr-guidelines.html


=head2 MaxRenditions => Int

Optional. The maximum number of renditions that MediaConvert will
create in your automated ABR stack. The number of renditions is
determined automatically, based on analysis of each job, but will never
exceed this limit. When you set this to Auto in the console, which is
equivalent to excluding it from your JSON job specification,
MediaConvert defaults to a limit of 15.


=head2 MinAbrBitrate => Int

Specify the minimum average bitrate for MediaConvert to use in your
automated ABR stack. If you don't specify a value, MediaConvert uses
600,000 (600 kb/s) by default. The average bitrate of your
lowest-quality rendition will be near this value. Note that the
instantaneous minimum bitrate may vary below the value that you
specify.


=head2 Rules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrRule>]

Optional. Use Automated ABR rules to specify restrictions for the
rendition sizes MediaConvert will create in your ABR stack. You can use
these rules if your ABR workflow has specific rendition size
requirements, but you still want MediaConvert to optimize for video
quality and overall file size.
