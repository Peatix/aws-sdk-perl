=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::FrameRate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::FrameRate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Denominator => $value, ..., Numerator => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::FrameRate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Denominator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The frame rate of the video or audio track.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Denominator => Int

The denominator, or bottom number, in the fractional frame rate. For
example, if your frame rate is 24000 / 1001 (23.976 frames per second),
then the denominator would be 1001.


=head2 Numerator => Int

The numerator, or top number, in the fractional frame rate. For
example, if your frame rate is 24000 / 1001 (23.976 frames per second),
then the numerator would be 24000.
