=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings related to WebVTT captions. WebVTT is a sidecar format that
holds captions in a file that is separate from the video container. Set
up sidecar captions in the same output group, but different output from
your video. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/ttml-and-webvtt-output-captions.html.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accessibility => Str

If the WebVTT captions track is intended to provide accessibility for
people who are deaf or hard of hearing: Set Accessibility subtitles to
Enabled. When you do, MediaConvert adds accessibility attributes to
your output HLS or DASH manifest. For HLS manifests, MediaConvert adds
the following accessibility attributes under EXT-X-MEDIA for this
track:
CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.describes-spoken-dialog,public.accessibility.describes-music-and-sound"
and AUTOSELECT="YES". For DASH manifests, MediaConvert adds the
following in the adaptation set for this track: . If the captions track
is not intended to provide such accessibility: Keep the default value,
Disabled. When you do, for DASH manifests, MediaConvert instead adds
the following in the adaptation set for this track: .


=head2 StylePassthrough => Str

Specify how MediaConvert writes style information in your output WebVTT
captions. To use the available style, color, and position information
from your input captions: Choose Enabled. MediaConvert uses default
settings when style and position information is missing from your input
captions. To recreate the input captions exactly: Choose Strict.
MediaConvert automatically applies timing adjustments, including
adjustments for frame rate conversion, ad avails, and input clipping.
Your input captions format must be WebVTT. To ignore the style and
position information from your input captions and use simplified output
captions: Keep the default value, Disabled. Or leave blank. To use the
available style, color, and position information from your input
captions, while merging cues with identical time ranges: Choose merge.
This setting can help prevent positioning overlaps for certain players
that expect a single single cue for any given time range.
