=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings related to IMSC captions. IMSC is a sidecar format that holds
captions in a file that is separate from the video container. Set up
sidecar captions in the same output group, but different output from
your video. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/ttml-and-webvtt-output-captions.html.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accessibility => Str

If the IMSC captions track is intended to provide accessibility for
people who are deaf or hard of hearing: Set Accessibility subtitles to
Enabled. When you do, MediaConvert adds accessibility attributes to
your output HLS or DASH manifest. For HLS manifests, MediaConvert adds
the following accessibility attributes under EXT-X-MEDIA for this
track:
CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.describes-spoken-dialog,public.accessibility.describes-music-and-sound"
and AUTOSELECT="YES". For DASH manifests, MediaConvert adds the
following in the adaptation set for this track: . If the captions track
is not intended to provide such accessibility: Keep the default value,
Disabled. When you do, for DASH manifests, MediaConvert instead adds
the following in the adaptation set for this track: .


=head2 StylePassthrough => Str

Keep this setting enabled to have MediaConvert use the font style and
position information from the captions source in the output. This
option is available only when your input captions are IMSC, SMPTE-TT,
or TTML. Disable this setting for simplified output captions.
