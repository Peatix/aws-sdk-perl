=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::MpdSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::MpdSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessibilityCaptionHints => $value, ..., TimedMetadataValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::MpdSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessibilityCaptionHints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for the segments
in your DASH outputs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessibilityCaptionHints => Str

Optional. Choose Include to have MediaConvert mark up your DASH
manifest with elements for embedded 608 captions. This markup isn't
generally required, but some video players require it to discover and
play embedded 608 captions. Keep the default value, Exclude, to leave
these elements out. When you enable this setting, this is the markup
that MediaConvert includes in your manifest:


=head2 AudioDuration => Str

Specify this setting only when your output will be consumed by a
downstream repackaging workflow that is sensitive to very small
duration differences between video and audio. For this situation,
choose Match video duration. In all other cases, keep the default
value, Default codec duration. When you choose Match video duration,
MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them
to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as
long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or
trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer
than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming
only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented
outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When
you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies between audio and
video duration will depend on your output audio codec.


=head2 CaptionContainerType => Str

Use this setting only in DASH output groups that include sidecar TTML
or IMSC captions. You specify sidecar captions in a separate output
from your audio and video. Choose Raw for captions in a single XML file
in a raw container. Choose Fragmented MPEG-4 for captions in XML format
contained within fragmented MP4 files. This set of fragmented MP4 files
is separate from your video and audio fragmented MP4 files.


=head2 KlvMetadata => Str

To include key-length-value metadata in this output: Set KLV metadata
insertion to Passthrough. MediaConvert reads KLV metadata present in
your input and writes each instance to a separate event message box in
the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV metadata:
Set KLV metadata insertion to None or leave blank.


=head2 ManifestMetadataSignaling => Str

To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD manifest for
each type of event message, set Manifest metadata signaling to Enabled.
For ID3 event messages, the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will
be same value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI. For
SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will
be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave these elements out of your
output MPD manifest, set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled. To
enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must also set SCTE-35 source to
Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert, or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 Scte35Esam => Str

Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers from ESAM.
Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at the insertion
points that you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide the document
in the setting SCC XML.


=head2 Scte35Source => Str

Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in your input video
file. Choose Passthrough if you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in
your input to also appear in this output. Choose None if you don't want
those SCTE-35 markers in this output.


=head2 TimedMetadata => Str

To include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 metadata to
Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata in Custom ID3 metadata inserter.
MediaConvert writes each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate Event
Message (eMSG) box. To exclude this ID3 metadata: Set ID3 metadata to
None or leave blank.


=head2 TimedMetadataBoxVersion => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) version for ID3 timed metadata in
your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
5.10.3.3.3 Syntax. Leave blank to use the default value Version 0. When
you specify Version 1, you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI for ID3 timed
metadata in your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022
section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics. Leave blank to use the default value:
https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a value for ID3 metadata
scheme ID URI, you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 TimedMetadataValue => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3 timed metadata in
your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
5.10.3.3.4 Semantics. When you specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value,
you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.
