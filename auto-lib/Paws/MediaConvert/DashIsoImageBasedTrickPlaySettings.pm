=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlaySettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlaySettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IntervalCadence => $value, ..., TileWidth => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::DashIsoImageBasedTrickPlaySettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IntervalCadence

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tile and thumbnail settings applicable when imageBasedTrickPlay is
ADVANCED

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IntervalCadence => Str

The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating thumbnails. If set to
FOLLOW_IFRAME, MediaConvert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
the output (matching the GOP cadence). If set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM,
MediaConvert generates thumbnails according to the interval you specify
in thumbnailInterval.


=head2 ThumbnailHeight => Int

Height of each thumbnail within each tile image, in pixels. Leave blank
to maintain aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If following the aspect
ratio would lead to a total tile height greater than 4096, then the job
will be rejected. Must be divisible by 2.


=head2 ThumbnailInterval => Num

Enter the interval, in seconds, that MediaConvert uses to generate
thumbnails. If the interval you enter doesn't align with the output
frame rate, MediaConvert automatically rounds the interval to align
with the output frame rate. For example, if the output frame rate is
29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, MediaConvert uses a 150 frame
interval to generate thumbnails.


=head2 ThumbnailWidth => Int

Width of each thumbnail within each tile image, in pixels. Default is
312. Must be divisible by 8.


=head2 TileHeight => Int

Number of thumbnails in each column of a tile image. Set a value
between 2 and 2048. Must be divisible by 2.


=head2 TileWidth => Int

Number of thumbnails in each row of a tile image. Set a value between 1
and 512.
