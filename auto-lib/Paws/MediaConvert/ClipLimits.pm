=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::ClipLimits

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::ClipLimits object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumRGBTolerance => $value, ..., MinimumYUV => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::ClipLimits object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumRGBTolerance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify YUV limits and RGB tolerances when you set Sample range
conversion to Limited range clip.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaximumRGBTolerance => Int

Specify the Maximum RGB color sample range tolerance for your output.
MediaConvert corrects any YUV values that, when converted to RGB, would
be outside the upper tolerance that you specify. Enter an integer from
90 to 105 as an offset percentage to the maximum possible value. Leave
blank to use the default value 100. When you specify a value for
Maximum RGB tolerance, you must set Sample range conversion to Limited
range clip.


=head2 MaximumYUV => Int

Specify the Maximum YUV color sample limit. MediaConvert conforms any
pixels in your input above the value that you specify to typical
limited range bounds. Enter an integer from 920 to 1023. Leave blank to
use the default value 940. The value that you enter applies to 10-bit
ranges. For 8-bit ranges, MediaConvert automatically scales this value
down. When you specify a value for Maximum YUV, you must set Sample
range conversion to Limited range clip.


=head2 MinimumRGBTolerance => Int

Specify the Minimum RGB color sample range tolerance for your output.
MediaConvert corrects any YUV values that, when converted to RGB, would
be outside the lower tolerance that you specify. Enter an integer from
-5 to 10 as an offset percentage to the minimum possible value. Leave
blank to use the default value 0. When you specify a value for Minimum
RGB tolerance, you must set Sample range conversion to Limited range
clip.


=head2 MinimumYUV => Int

Specify the Minimum YUV color sample limit. MediaConvert conforms any
pixels in your input below the value that you specify to typical
limited range bounds. Enter an integer from 0 to 128. Leave blank to
use the default value 64. The value that you enter applies to 10-bit
ranges. For 8-bit ranges, MediaConvert automatically scales this value
down. When you specify a value for Minumum YUV, you must set Sample
range conversion to Limited range clip.
