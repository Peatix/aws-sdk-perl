=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioDuration => $value, ..., Mp4MajorBrand => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::Mp4Settings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioDuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These settings relate to your MP4 output container. You can create
audio only outputs with this container. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/supported-codecs-containers-audio-only.html#output-codecs-and-containers-supported-for-audio-only.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AudioDuration => Str

Specify this setting only when your output will be consumed by a
downstream repackaging workflow that is sensitive to very small
duration differences between video and audio. For this situation,
choose Match video duration. In all other cases, keep the default
value, Default codec duration. When you choose Match video duration,
MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them
to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as
long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or
trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer
than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming
only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented
outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When
you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies between audio and
video duration will depend on your output audio codec.


=head2 CslgAtom => Str

When enabled, file composition times will start at zero, composition
times in the 'ctts' (composition time to sample) box for B-frames will
be negative, and a 'cslg' (composition shift least greatest) box will
be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This improves compatibility with
Apple players and tools.


=head2 CttsVersion => Int

Ignore this setting unless compliance to the CTTS box version
specification matters in your workflow. Specify a value of 1 to set
your CTTS box version to 1 and make your output compliant with the
specification. When you specify a value of 1, you must also set CSLG
atom to the value INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0 to set your CTTS
box version to 0. This can provide backward compatibility for some
players and packagers.


=head2 FreeSpaceBox => Str

Inserts a free-space box immediately after the moov box.


=head2 MoovPlacement => Str

To place the MOOV atom at the beginning of your output, which is useful
for progressive downloading: Leave blank or choose Progressive
download. To place the MOOV at the end of your output: Choose Normal.


=head2 Mp4MajorBrand => Str

Overrides the "Major Brand" field in the output file. Usually not
necessary to specify.
