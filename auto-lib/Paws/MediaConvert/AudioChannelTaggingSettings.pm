Paws::MediaConvert::AudioChannelTaggingSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::AudioChannelTaggingSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelTag => $value, ..., ChannelTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::AudioChannelTaggingSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelTag

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify the QuickTime audio channel layout tags for the audio channels
in this audio track. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
labels your track as Center (C) by default. To use Audio layout
tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime (MOV) container and your
audio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelTag => Str

Specify the QuickTime audio channel layout tags for the audio channels
in this audio track. Enter channel layout tags in the same order as
your output's audio channel order. For example, if your output audio
track has a left and a right channel, enter Left (L) for the first
channel and Right (R) for the second. If your output has multiple
single-channel audio tracks, enter a single channel layout tag for each
track.


=head2 ChannelTags => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify the QuickTime audio channel layout tags for the audio channels
in this audio track. Enter channel layout tags in the same order as
your output's audio channel order. For example, if your output audio
track has a left and a right channel, enter Left (L) for the first
channel and Right (R) for the second. If your output has multiple
single-channel audio tracks, enter a single channel layout tag for each
track.
