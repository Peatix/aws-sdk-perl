=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::CmfcSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::CmfcSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioDuration => $value, ..., TimedMetadataValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::CmfcSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioDuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for the segments
in your CMAF outputs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AudioDuration => Str

Specify this setting only when your output will be consumed by a
downstream repackaging workflow that is sensitive to very small
duration differences between video and audio. For this situation,
choose Match video duration. In all other cases, keep the default
value, Default codec duration. When you choose Match video duration,
MediaConvert pads the output audio streams with silence or trims them
to ensure that the total duration of each audio stream is at least as
long as the total duration of the video stream. After padding or
trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than one frame longer
than the video stream. MediaConvert applies audio padding or trimming
only to the end of the last segment of the output. For unsegmented
outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the file. When
you keep the default value, any minor discrepancies between audio and
video duration will depend on your output audio codec.


=head2 AudioGroupId => Str

Specify the audio rendition group for this audio rendition. Specify up
to one value for each audio output in your output group. This value
appears in your HLS parent manifest in the EXT-X-MEDIA tag of
TYPE=AUDIO, as the value for the GROUP-ID attribute. For example, if
you specify "audio_aac_1" for Audio group ID, it appears in your
manifest like this: #EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio_aac_1".
Related setting: To associate the rendition group that this audio track
belongs to with a video rendition, include the same value that you
provide here for that video output's setting Audio rendition sets.


=head2 AudioRenditionSets => Str

List the audio rendition groups that you want included with this video
rendition. Use a comma-separated list. For example, say you want to
include the audio rendition groups that have the audio group IDs
"audio_aac_1" and "audio_dolby". Then you would specify this value:
"audio_aac_1,audio_dolby". Related setting: The rendition groups that
you include in your comma-separated list should all match values that
you specify in the setting Audio group ID for audio renditions in the
same output group as this video rendition. Default behavior: If you
don't specify anything here and for Audio group ID, MediaConvert puts
each audio variant in its own audio rendition group and associates it
with every video variant. Each value in your list appears in your HLS
parent manifest in the EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value for the AUDIO
attribute. To continue the previous example, say that the file name for
the child manifest for your video rendition is "amazing_video_1.m3u8".
Then, in your parent manifest, each value will appear on separate
lines, like this: #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_aac_1"...
amazing_video_1.m3u8 #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_dolby"...
amazing_video_1.m3u8


=head2 AudioTrackType => Str

Use this setting to control the values that MediaConvert puts in your
HLS parent playlist to control how the client player selects which
audio track to play. Choose Audio-only variant stream
(AUDIO_ONLY_VARIANT_STREAM) for any variant that you want to prohibit
the client from playing with video. This causes MediaConvert to
represent the variant as an EXT-X-STREAM-INF in the HLS manifest. The
other options for this setting determine the values that MediaConvert
writes for the DEFAULT and AUTOSELECT attributes of the EXT-X-MEDIA
entry for the audio variant. For more information about these
attributes, see the Apple documentation article
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist.
Choose Alternate audio, auto select, default to set DEFAULT=YES and
AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this value for only one variant in your output
group. Choose Alternate audio, auto select, not default to set
DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose Alternate Audio, Not Auto Select
to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=NO. When you don't specify a value for
this setting, MediaConvert defaults to Alternate audio, auto select,
default. When there is more than one variant in your output group, you
must explicitly choose a value for this setting.


=head2 DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag => Str

Specify whether to flag this audio track as descriptive video service
(DVS) in your HLS parent manifest. When you choose Flag, MediaConvert
includes the parameter
CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.describes-video" in the
EXT-X-MEDIA entry for this track. When you keep the default choice,
Don't flag, MediaConvert leaves this parameter out. The DVS flag can
help with accessibility on Apple devices. For more information, see the
Apple documentation.


=head2 IFrameOnlyManifest => Str

Choose Include to have MediaConvert generate an HLS child manifest that
lists only the I-frames for this rendition, in addition to your regular
manifest for this rendition. You might use this manifest as part of a
workflow that creates preview functions for your video. MediaConvert
adds both the I-frame only child manifest and the regular child
manifest to the parent manifest. When you don't need the I-frame only
child manifest, keep the default value Exclude.


=head2 KlvMetadata => Str

To include key-length-value metadata in this output: Set KLV metadata
insertion to Passthrough. MediaConvert reads KLV metadata present in
your input and writes each instance to a separate event message box in
the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV metadata:
Set KLV metadata insertion to None or leave blank.


=head2 ManifestMetadataSignaling => Str

To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD manifest for
each type of event message, set Manifest metadata signaling to Enabled.
For ID3 event messages, the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will
be same value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI. For
SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will
be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave these elements out of your
output MPD manifest, set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled. To
enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must also set SCTE-35 source to
Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert, or ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 Scte35Esam => Str

Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers from ESAM.
Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at the insertion
points that you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide the document
in the setting SCC XML.


=head2 Scte35Source => Str

Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in your input video
file. Choose Passthrough if you want SCTE-35 markers that appear in
your input to also appear in this output. Choose None if you don't want
those SCTE-35 markers in this output.


=head2 TimedMetadata => Str

To include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 metadata to
Passthrough. Specify this ID3 metadata in Custom ID3 metadata inserter.
MediaConvert writes each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate Event
Message (eMSG) box. To exclude this ID3 metadata: Set ID3 metadata to
None or leave blank.


=head2 TimedMetadataBoxVersion => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) version for ID3 timed metadata in
your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
5.10.3.3.3 Syntax. Leave blank to use the default value Version 0. When
you specify Version 1, you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI for ID3 timed
metadata in your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022
section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics. Leave blank to use the default value:
https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a value for ID3 metadata
scheme ID URI, you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.


=head2 TimedMetadataValue => Str

Specify the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3 timed metadata in
your output. For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
5.10.3.3.4 Semantics. When you specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value,
you must also set ID3 metadata to Passthrough.
