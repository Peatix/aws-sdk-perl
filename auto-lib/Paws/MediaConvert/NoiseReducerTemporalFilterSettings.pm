=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggressiveMode => $value, ..., Strength => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::NoiseReducerTemporalFilterSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggressiveMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggressiveMode => Int

Use Aggressive mode for content that has complex motion. Higher values
produce stronger temporal filtering. This filters highly complex scenes
more aggressively and creates better VQ for low bitrate outputs.


=head2 PostTemporalSharpening => Str

When you set Noise reducer to Temporal, the bandwidth and sharpness of
your output is reduced. You can optionally use Post temporal sharpening
to apply sharpening to the edges of your output. Note that Post
temporal sharpening will also make the bandwidth reduction from the
Noise reducer smaller. The default behavior, Auto, allows the
transcoder to determine whether to apply sharpening, depending on your
input type and quality. When you set Post temporal sharpening to
Enabled, specify how much sharpening is applied using Post temporal
sharpening strength. Set Post temporal sharpening to Disabled to not
apply sharpening.


=head2 PostTemporalSharpeningStrength => Str

Use Post temporal sharpening strength to define the amount of
sharpening the transcoder applies to your output. Set Post temporal
sharpening strength to Low, Medium, or High to indicate the amount of
sharpening.


=head2 Speed => Int

The speed of the filter (higher number is faster). Low setting reduces
bit rate at the cost of transcode time, high setting improves transcode
time at the cost of bit rate.


=head2 Strength => Int

Specify the strength of the noise reducing filter on this output.
Higher values produce stronger filtering. We recommend the following
value ranges, depending on the result that you want: * 0-2 for
complexity reduction with minimal sharpness loss * 2-8 for complexity
reduction with image preservation * 8-16 for a high level of complexity
reduction
