=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::MinBottomRenditionSize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::MinBottomRenditionSize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., Width => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::MinBottomRenditionSize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use Min bottom rendition size to specify a minimum size for the lowest
resolution in your ABR stack. * The lowest resolution in your ABR stack
will be equal to or greater than the value that you enter. For example:
If you specify 640x360 the lowest resolution in your ABR stack will be
equal to or greater than to 640x360. * If you specify a Min top
rendition size rule, the value that you specify for Min bottom
rendition size must be less than, or equal to, Min top rendition size.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
