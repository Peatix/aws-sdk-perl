=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedRenditions => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::AutomatedAbrRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedRenditions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify one or more Automated ABR rule types. Note: Force include and
Allowed renditions are mutually exclusive.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedRenditions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::AllowedRenditionSize>]

When customer adds the allowed renditions rule for auto ABR ladder,
they are required to add at leat one rendition to allowedRenditions
list


=head2 ForceIncludeRenditions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::ForceIncludeRenditionSize>]

When customer adds the force include renditions rule for auto ABR
ladder, they are required to add at leat one rendition to
forceIncludeRenditions list


=head2 MinBottomRenditionSize => L<Paws::MediaConvert::MinBottomRenditionSize>

Use Min bottom rendition size to specify a minimum size for the lowest
resolution in your ABR stack. * The lowest resolution in your ABR stack
will be equal to or greater than the value that you enter. For example:
If you specify 640x360 the lowest resolution in your ABR stack will be
equal to or greater than to 640x360. * If you specify a Min top
rendition size rule, the value that you specify for Min bottom
rendition size must be less than, or equal to, Min top rendition size.


=head2 MinTopRenditionSize => L<Paws::MediaConvert::MinTopRenditionSize>

Use Min top rendition size to specify a minimum size for the highest
resolution in your ABR stack. * The highest resolution in your ABR
stack will be equal to or greater than the value that you enter. For
example: If you specify 1280x720 the highest resolution in your ABR
stack will be equal to or greater than 1280x720. * If you specify a
value for Max resolution, the value that you specify for Min top
rendition size must be less than, or equal to, Max resolution.


=head2 Type => Str

Use Min top rendition size to specify a minimum size for the highest
resolution in your ABR stack. * The highest resolution in your ABR
stack will be equal to or greater than the value that you enter. For
example: If you specify 1280x720 the highest resolution in your ABR
stack will be equal to or greater than 1280x720. * If you specify a
value for Max resolution, the value that you specify for Min top
rendition size must be less than, or equal to, Max resolution. Use Min
bottom rendition size to specify a minimum size for the lowest
resolution in your ABR stack. * The lowest resolution in your ABR stack
will be equal to or greater than the value that you enter. For example:
If you specify 640x360 the lowest resolution in your ABR stack will be
equal to or greater than to 640x360. * If you specify a Min top
rendition size rule, the value that you specify for Min bottom
rendition size must be less than, or equal to, Min top rendition size.
Use Force include renditions to specify one or more resolutions to
include your ABR stack. * (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR,
specify as few resolutions as possible. * (Required) The number of
resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or less than, the Max
renditions setting. * If you specify a Min top rendition size rule,
specify at least one resolution that is equal to, or greater than, Min
top rendition size. * If you specify a Min bottom rendition size rule,
only specify resolutions that are equal to, or greater than, Min bottom
rendition size. * If you specify a Force include renditions rule, do
not specify a separate rule for Allowed renditions. * Note: The ABR
stack may include other resolutions that you do not specify here,
depending on the Max renditions setting. Use Allowed renditions to
specify a list of possible resolutions in your ABR stack. * (Required)
The number of resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or greater
than, the Max renditions setting. * MediaConvert will create an ABR
stack exclusively from the list of resolutions that you specify. * Some
resolutions in the Allowed renditions list may not be included, however
you can force a resolution to be included by setting Required to
ENABLED. * You must specify at least one resolution that is greater
than or equal to any resolutions that you specify in Min top rendition
size or Min bottom rendition size. * If you specify Allowed renditions,
you must not specify a separate rule for Force include renditions.
