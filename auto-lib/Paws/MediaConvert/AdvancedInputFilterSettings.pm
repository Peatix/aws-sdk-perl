=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddTexture => Str

Add texture and detail to areas of your input video content that were
lost after applying the Advanced input filter. To adaptively add
texture and reduce softness: Choose Enabled. To not add any texture:
Keep the default value, Disabled. We recommend that you choose Disabled
for input video content that doesn't have texture, including screen
recordings, computer graphics, or cartoons.


=head2 Sharpening => Str

Optionally specify the amount of sharpening to apply when you use the
Advanced input filter. Sharpening adds contrast to the edges of your
video content and can reduce softness. To apply no sharpening: Keep the
default value, Off. To apply a minimal amount of sharpening choose Low,
or for the maximum choose High.
