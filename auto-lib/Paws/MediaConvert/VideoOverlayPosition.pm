=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayPosition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayPosition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., YPosition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayPosition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

position of video overlay

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Height => Int

To scale your video overlay to the same height as the base input video:
Leave blank. To scale the height of your video overlay to a different
height: Enter an integer representing the Unit type that you choose,
either Pixels or Percentage. For example, when you enter 360 and choose
Pixels, your video overlay will be rendered with a height of 360. When
you enter 50, choose Percentage, and your overlay's source has a height
of 1080, your video overlay will be rendered with a height of 540. To
scale your overlay to a specific height while automatically maintaining
its original aspect ratio, enter a value for Height and leave Width
blank.


=head2 Unit => Str

Specify the Unit type to use when you enter a value for X position, Y
position, Width, or Height. You can choose Pixels or Percentage. Leave
blank to use the default value, Pixels.


=head2 Width => Int

To scale your video overlay to the same width as the base input video:
Leave blank. To scale the width of your video overlay to a different
width: Enter an integer representing the Unit type that you choose,
either Pixels or Percentage. For example, when you enter 640 and choose
Pixels, your video overlay will scale to a height of 640 pixels. When
you enter 50, choose Percentage, and your overlay's source has a width
of 1920, your video overlay will scale to a width of 960. To scale your
overlay to a specific width while automatically maintaining its
original aspect ratio, enter a value for Width and leave Height blank.


=head2 XPosition => Int

To position the left edge of your video overlay along the left edge of
the base input video's frame: Keep blank, or enter 0. To position the
left edge of your video overlay to the right, relative to the left edge
of the base input video's frame: Enter an integer representing the Unit
type that you choose, either Pixels or Percentage. For example, when
you enter 10 and choose Pixels, your video overlay will be positioned
10 pixels from the left edge of the base input video's frame. When you
enter 10, choose Percentage, and your base input video is 1920x1080,
your video overlay will be positioned 192 pixels from the left edge of
the base input video's frame.


=head2 YPosition => Int

To position the top edge of your video overlay along the top edge of
the base input video's frame: Keep blank, or enter 0. To position the
top edge of your video overlay down, relative to the top edge of the
base input video's frame: Enter an integer representing the Unit type
that you choose, either Pixels or Percentage. For example, when you
enter 10 and choose Pixels, your video overlay will be positioned 10
pixels from the top edge of the base input video's frame. When you
enter 10, choose Percentage, and your underlying video is 1920x1080,
your video overlay will be positioned 108 pixels from the top edge of
the base input video's frame.
