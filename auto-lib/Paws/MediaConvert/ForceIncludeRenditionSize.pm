=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::ForceIncludeRenditionSize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::ForceIncludeRenditionSize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., Width => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::ForceIncludeRenditionSize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use Force include renditions to specify one or more resolutions to
include your ABR stack. * (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR,
specify as few resolutions as possible. * (Required) The number of
resolutions that you specify must be equal to, or less than, the Max
renditions setting. * If you specify a Min top rendition size rule,
specify at least one resolution that is equal to, or greater than, Min
top rendition size. * If you specify a Min bottom rendition size rule,
only specify resolutions that are equal to, or greater than, Min bottom
rendition size. * If you specify a Force include renditions rule, do
not specify a separate rule for Allowed renditions. * Note: The ABR
stack may include other resolutions that you do not specify here,
depending on the Max renditions setting.
