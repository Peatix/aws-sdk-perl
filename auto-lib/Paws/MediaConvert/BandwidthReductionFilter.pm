=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::BandwidthReductionFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::BandwidthReductionFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Sharpening => $value, ..., Strength => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::BandwidthReductionFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Sharpening

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Bandwidth reduction filter increases the video quality of your
output relative to its bitrate. Use to lower the bitrate of your
constant quality QVBR output, with little or no perceptual decrease in
quality. Or, use to increase the video quality of outputs with other
rate control modes relative to the bitrate that you specify. Bandwidth
reduction increases further when your input is low quality or noisy.
Outputs that use this feature incur pro-tier pricing. When you include
Bandwidth reduction filter, you cannot include the Noise reducer
preprocessor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Sharpening => Str

Optionally specify the level of sharpening to apply when you use the
Bandwidth reduction filter. Sharpening adds contrast to the edges of
your video content and can reduce softness. Keep the default value Off
to apply no sharpening. Set Sharpening strength to Low to apply a
minimal amount of sharpening, or High to apply a maximum amount of
sharpening.


=head2 Strength => Str

Specify the strength of the Bandwidth reduction filter. For most
workflows, we recommend that you choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of
your output with little to no perceptual decrease in video quality. For
high quality and high bitrate outputs, choose Low. For the most
bandwidth reduction, choose High. We recommend that you choose High for
low bitrate outputs. Note that High may incur a slight increase in the
softness of your output.
