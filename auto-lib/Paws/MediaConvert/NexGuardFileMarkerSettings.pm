=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::NexGuardFileMarkerSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::NexGuardFileMarkerSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { License => $value, ..., Strength => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::NexGuardFileMarkerSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->License

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For forensic video watermarking, MediaConvert supports Nagra NexGuard
File Marker watermarking. MediaConvert supports both PreRelease Content
(NGPR/G2) and OTT Streaming workflows.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 License => Str

Use the base64 license string that Nagra provides you. Enter it
directly in your JSON job specification or in the console. Required
when you include Nagra NexGuard File Marker watermarking in your job.


=head2 Payload => Int

Specify the payload ID that you want associated with this output. Valid
values vary depending on your Nagra NexGuard forensic watermarking
workflow. Required when you include Nagra NexGuard File Marker
watermarking in your job. For PreRelease Content (NGPR/G2), specify an
integer from 1 through 4,194,303. You must generate a unique ID for
each asset you watermark, and keep a record of which ID you have
assigned to each asset. Neither Nagra nor MediaConvert keep track of
the relationship between output files and your IDs. For OTT Streaming,
create two adaptive bitrate (ABR) stacks for each asset. Do this by
setting up two output groups. For one output group, set the value of
Payload ID to 0 in every output. For the other output group, set
Payload ID to 1 in every output.


=head2 Preset => Str

Enter one of the watermarking preset strings that Nagra provides you.
Required when you include Nagra NexGuard File Marker watermarking in
your job.


=head2 Strength => Str

Optional. Ignore this setting unless Nagra support directs you to
specify a value. When you don't specify a value here, the Nagra
NexGuard library uses its default value.
