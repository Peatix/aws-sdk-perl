=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::AllowedRenditionSize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::AllowedRenditionSize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., Width => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::AllowedRenditionSize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use Allowed renditions to specify a list of possible resolutions in
your ABR stack. * MediaConvert will create an ABR stack exclusively
from the list of resolutions that you specify. * Some resolutions in
the Allowed renditions list may not be included, however you can force
a resolution to be included by setting Required to ENABLED. * You must
specify at least one resolution that is greater than or equal to any
resolutions that you specify in Min top rendition size or Min bottom
rendition size. * If you specify Allowed renditions, you must not
specify a separate rule for Force include renditions.
