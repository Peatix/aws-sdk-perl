=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::RemixSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::RemixSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioDescriptionAudioChannel => $value, ..., ChannelsOut => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::RemixSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioDescriptionAudioChannel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use Manual audio remixing to adjust audio levels for each audio channel
in each output of your job. With audio remixing, you can output more or
fewer audio channels than your input audio source provides.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AudioDescriptionAudioChannel => Int

Optionally specify the channel in your input that contains your audio
description audio signal. MediaConvert mixes your audio signal across
all output channels, while reducing their volume according to your data
stream. When you specify an audio description audio channel, you must
also specify an audio description data channel. For more information
about audio description signals, see the BBC WHP 198 and 051 white
papers.


=head2 AudioDescriptionDataChannel => Int

Optionally specify the channel in your input that contains your audio
description data stream. MediaConvert mixes your audio signal across
all output channels, while reducing their volume according to your data
stream. When you specify an audio description data channel, you must
also specify an audio description audio channel. For more information
about audio description signals, see the BBC WHP 198 and 051 white
papers.


=head2 ChannelMapping => L<Paws::MediaConvert::ChannelMapping>

Channel mapping contains the group of fields that hold the remixing
value for each channel, in dB. Specify remix values to indicate how
much of the content from your input audio channel you want in your
output audio channels. Each instance of the InputChannels or
InputChannelsFineTune array specifies these values for one output
channel. Use one instance of this array for each output channel. In the
console, each array corresponds to a column in the graphical depiction
of the mapping matrix. The rows of the graphical matrix correspond to
input channels. Valid values are within the range from -60 (mute)
through 6. A setting of 0 passes the input channel unchanged to the
output channel (no attenuation or amplification). Use InputChannels or
InputChannelsFineTune to specify your remix values. Don't use both.


=head2 ChannelsIn => Int

Specify the number of audio channels from your input that you want to
use in your output. With remixing, you might combine or split the data
in these channels, so the number of channels in your final output might
be different. If you are doing both input channel mapping and output
channel mapping, the number of output channels in your input mapping
must be the same as the number of input channels in your output
mapping.


=head2 ChannelsOut => Int

Specify the number of channels in this output after remixing. Valid
values: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If you are
doing both input channel mapping and output channel mapping, the number
of output channels in your input mapping must be the same as the number
of input channels in your output mapping.
