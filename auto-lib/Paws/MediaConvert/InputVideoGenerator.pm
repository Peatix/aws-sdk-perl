=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::InputVideoGenerator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::InputVideoGenerator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Channels => $value, ..., SampleRate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::InputVideoGenerator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Channels

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you include Video generator, MediaConvert creates a video input
with black frames. Use this setting if you do not have a video input or
if you want to add black video frames before, or after, other inputs.
You can specify Video generator, or you can specify an Input file, but
you cannot specify both. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-generator.html

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Channels => Int

Specify the number of audio channels to include in your video generator
input. MediaConvert creates these audio channels as silent audio within
a single audio track. Enter an integer from 1 to 32.


=head2 Duration => Int

Specify the duration, in milliseconds, for your video generator input.
Enter an integer from 50 to 86400000.


=head2 FramerateDenominator => Int

Specify the denominator of the fraction that represents the frame rate
for your video generator input. When you do, you must also specify a
value for Frame rate numerator. MediaConvert uses a default frame rate
of 29.97 when you leave Frame rate numerator and Frame rate denominator
blank.


=head2 FramerateNumerator => Int

Specify the numerator of the fraction that represents the frame rate
for your video generator input. When you do, you must also specify a
value for Frame rate denominator. MediaConvert uses a default frame
rate of 29.97 when you leave Frame rate numerator and Frame rate
denominator blank.


=head2 SampleRate => Int

Specify the audio sample rate, in Hz, for the silent audio in your
video generator input. Enter an integer from 32000 to 48000.
