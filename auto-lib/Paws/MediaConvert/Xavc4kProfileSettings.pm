=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::Xavc4kProfileSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::Xavc4kProfileSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BitrateClass => $value, ..., Slices => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::Xavc4kProfileSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BitrateClass

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Required when you set Profile to the value XAVC_4K.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BitrateClass => Str

Specify the XAVC 4k (Long GOP) Bitrate Class to set the bitrate of your
output. Outputs of the same class have similar image quality over the
operating points that are valid for that class.


=head2 CodecProfile => Str

Specify the codec profile for this output. Choose High, 8-bit, 4:2:0
(HIGH) or High, 10-bit, 4:2:2 (HIGH_422). These profiles are specified
in ITU-T H.264.


=head2 FlickerAdaptiveQuantization => Str

The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to keep the default
value, Auto, for the setting Adaptive quantization. When you do so,
MediaConvert automatically applies the best types of quantization for
your video content. Include this setting in your JSON job specification
only when you choose to change the default value for Adaptive
quantization. Enable this setting to have the encoder reduce I-frame
pop. I-frame pop appears as a visual flicker that can arise when the
encoder saves bits by copying some macroblocks many times from frame to
frame, and then refreshes them at the I-frame. When you enable this
setting, the encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more often to
smooth out the flicker. This setting is disabled by default. Related
setting: In addition to enabling this setting, you must also set
Adaptive quantization to a value other than Off or Auto. Use Adaptive
quantization to adjust the degree of smoothing that Flicker adaptive
quantization provides.


=head2 GopBReference => Str

Specify whether the encoder uses B-frames as reference frames for other
pictures in the same GOP. Choose Allow to allow the encoder to use
B-frames as reference frames. Choose Don't allow to prevent the encoder
from using B-frames as reference frames.


=head2 GopClosedCadence => Int

Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applications, it is recommended
that this be set to 1 so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an
IDR frame as quickly as possible. Setting this value to 0 will break
output segmenting.


=head2 HrdBufferSize => Int

Specify the size of the buffer that MediaConvert uses in the HRD buffer
model for this output. Specify this value in bits; for example, enter
five megabits as 5000000. When you don't set this value, or you set it
to zero, MediaConvert calculates the default by doubling the bitrate of
this output point.


=head2 QualityTuningLevel => Str

Optional. Use Quality tuning level to choose how you want to trade off
encoding speed for output video quality. The default behavior is
faster, lower quality, single-pass encoding.


=head2 Slices => Int

Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or equal to the number
of macroblock rows for progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
half the number of macroblock rows for interlaced pictures.
