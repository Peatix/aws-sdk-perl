=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlay

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlay object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Crop => $value, ..., Transitions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlay object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Crop

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Overlay one or more videos on top of your input video. For more
information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-overlays.html

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Crop => L<Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayCrop>

Specify a rectangle of content to crop and use from your video
overlay's input video. When you do, MediaConvert uses the cropped
dimensions that you specify under X offset, Y offset, Width, and
Height.


=head2 EndTimecode => Str

Enter the end timecode in the base input video for this overlay. Your
overlay will be active through this frame. To display your video
overlay for the duration of the base input video: Leave blank. Use the
format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the hour, MM is the
minute, SS isthe second, and FF is the frame number. When entering this
value, take into account your choice for the base input video's
timecode source. For example, if you have embedded timecodes that start
at 01:00:00:00 and you want your overlay to end ten minutes into the
video, enter 01:10:00:00.


=head2 InitialPosition => L<Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayPosition>

Specify the Initial position of your video overlay. To specify the
Initial position of your video overlay, including distance from the
left or top edge of the base input video's frame, or size: Enter a
value for X position, Y position, Width, or Height. To use the full
frame of the base input video: Leave blank.


=head2 Input => L<Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayInput>

Input settings for Video overlay. You can include one or more video
overlays in sequence at different times that you specify.


=head2 Playback => Str

Specify whether your video overlay repeats or plays only once. To
repeat your video overlay on a loop: Keep the default value, Repeat.
Your overlay will repeat for the duration of the base input video. To
playback your video overlay only once: Choose Once. With either option,
you can end playback at a time that you specify by entering a value for
End timecode.


=head2 StartTimecode => Str

Enter the start timecode in the base input video for this overlay. Your
overlay will be active starting with this frame. To display your video
overlay starting at the beginning of the base input video: Leave blank.
Use the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the hour, MM is
the minute, SS is the second, and FF is the frame number. When entering
this value, take into account your choice for the base input video's
timecode source. For example, if you have embedded timecodes that start
at 01:00:00:00 and you want your overlay to begin five minutes into the
video, enter 01:05:00:00.


=head2 Transitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayTransition>]

Specify one or more transitions for your video overlay. Use Transitions
to reposition or resize your overlay over time. To use the same
position and size for the duration of your video overlay: Leave blank.
To specify a Transition: Enter a value for Start timecode, End
Timecode, X Position, Y Position, Width, or Height.
