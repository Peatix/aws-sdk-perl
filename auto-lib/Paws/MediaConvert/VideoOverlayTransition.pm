=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayTransition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayTransition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndPosition => $value, ..., StartTimecode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayTransition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndPosition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify one or more Transitions for your video overlay. Use Transitions
to reposition or resize your overlay over time. To use the same
position and size for the duration of your video overlay: Leave blank.
To specify a Transition: Enter a value for Start timecode, End
Timecode, X Position, Y Position, Width, or Height.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndPosition => L<Paws::MediaConvert::VideoOverlayPosition>

Specify the ending position for this transition, relative to the base
input video's frame. Your video overlay will move smoothly to this
position, beginning at this transition's Start timecode and ending at
this transition's End timecode.


=head2 EndTimecode => Str

Specify the timecode for when this transition ends. Use the format
HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the hour, MM is the minute, SS
is the second, and FF is the frame number. When entering this value,
take into account your choice for Timecode source.


=head2 StartTimecode => Str

Specify the timecode for when this transition begins. Use the format
HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the hour, MM is the minute, SS
is the second, and FF is the frame number. When entering this value,
take into account your choice for Timecode source.
