=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure that contains information about a stack set operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => Str

The type of stack set operation: C<CREATE>, C<UPDATE>, or C<DELETE>.
Create and delete operations affect only the specified stack set
instances that are associated with the specified stack set. Update
operations affect both the stack set itself, in addition to I<all>
associated stack set instances.


=head2 AdministrationRoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used to perform this
stack set operation.

Use customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can
manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For
more information, see Grant self-managed permissions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-prereqs-self-managed.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 CreationTimestamp => Str

The time at which the operation was initiated. Note that the creation
times for the stack set operation might differ from the creation time
of the individual stacks themselves. This is because CloudFormation
needs to perform preparatory work for the operation, such as
dispatching the work to the requested Regions, before actually creating
the first stacks.


=head2 DeploymentTargets => L<Paws::CloudFormation::DeploymentTargets>

[Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts affected by
the stack operation.


=head2 EndTimestamp => Str

The time at which the stack set operation ended, across all accounts
and Regions specified. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean that the
stack set operation was successful, or even attempted, in each account
or Region.


=head2 ExecutionRoleName => Str

The name of the IAM execution role used to create or update the stack
set.

Use customized execution roles to control which stack resources users
and groups can include in their stack sets.


=head2 OperationId => Str

The unique ID of a stack set operation.


=head2 OperationPreferences => L<Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationPreferences>

The preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set
operation.


=head2 RetainStacks => Bool

For stack set operations of action type C<DELETE>, specifies whether to
remove the stack instances from the specified stack set, but doesn't
delete the stacks. You can't re-associate a retained stack, or add an
existing, saved stack to a new stack set.


=head2 StackSetDriftDetectionDetails => L<Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetDriftDetectionDetails>

Detailed information about the drift status of the stack set. This
includes information about drift operations currently being performed
on the stack set.

This information will only be present for stack set operations whose
C<Action> type is C<DETECT_DRIFT>.

For more information, see Performing drift detection on CloudFormation
StackSets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-drift.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 StackSetId => Str

The ID of the stack set.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the operation.

=over

=item *

C<FAILED>: The operation exceeded the specified failure tolerance. The
failure tolerance value that you've set for an operation is applied for
each Region during stack create and update operations. If the number of
failed stacks within a Region exceeds the failure tolerance, the status
of the operation in the Region is set to C<FAILED>. This in turn sets
the status of the operation as a whole to C<FAILED>, and CloudFormation
cancels the operation in any remaining Regions.

=item *

C<QUEUED>: [Service-managed permissions] For automatic deployments that
require a sequence of operations, the operation is queued to be
performed. For more information, see the StackSets status codes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html#stackset-status-codes)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

=item *

C<RUNNING>: The operation is currently being performed.

=item *

C<STOPPED>: The user has canceled the operation.

=item *

C<STOPPING>: The operation is in the process of stopping, at user
request.

=item *

C<SUCCEEDED>: The operation completed creating or updating all the
specified stacks without exceeding the failure tolerance for the
operation.

=back



=head2 StatusDetails => L<Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationStatusDetails>

Detailed information about the StackSet operation.


=head2 StatusReason => Str

The status of the operation in details.
