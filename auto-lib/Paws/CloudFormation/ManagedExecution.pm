=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ManagedExecution

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::ManagedExecution object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Active => $value, ..., Active => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::ManagedExecution object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Active

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Active => Bool

When C<true>, StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
concurrently and queues conflicting operations. After conflicting
operations finish, StackSets starts queued operations in request order.

If there are already running or queued operations, StackSets queues all
incoming operations even if they are non-conflicting.

You can't modify your stack set's execution configuration while there
are running or queued operations for that stack set.

When C<false> (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time in
request order.
