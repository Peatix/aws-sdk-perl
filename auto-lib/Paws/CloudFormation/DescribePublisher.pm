=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $DescribePublisherOutput = $cloudformation->DescribePublisher(
      PublisherId => 'MyPublisherId',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $IdentityProvider = $DescribePublisherOutput->IdentityProvider;
    my $PublisherId      = $DescribePublisherOutput->PublisherId;
