=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::TypeSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::TypeSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefaultVersionId => $value, ..., TypeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::TypeSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefaultVersionId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains summary information about the specified CloudFormation
extension.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DefaultVersionId => Str

The ID of the default version of the extension. The default version is
used when the extension version isn't specified.

This applies only to private extensions you have registered in your
account. For public extensions, both those provided by Amazon and
published by third parties, CloudFormation returns C<null>. For more
information, see RegisterType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html).

To set the default version of an extension, use SetTypeDefaultVersion.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the extension.


=head2 IsActivated => Bool

Whether the extension is activated for this account and Region.

This applies only to third-party public extensions. Extensions
published by Amazon are activated by default.


=head2 LastUpdated => Str

When the specified extension version was registered. This applies only
to:

=over

=item *

Private extensions you have registered in your account. For more
information, see RegisterType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html).

=item *

Public extensions you have activated in your account with auto-update
specified. For more information, see ActivateType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html).

=back

For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns C<null>.


=head2 LatestPublicVersion => Str

For public extensions that have been activated for this account and
Region, the latest version of the public extension I<that is
available>. For any extensions other than activated third-party
extensions, CloudFormation returns C<null>.

How you specified C<AutoUpdate> when enabling the extension affects
whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this
account and Region when a new version is released. For more
information, see Automatically use new versions of extensions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 OriginalTypeName => Str

For public extensions that have been activated for this account and
Region, the type name of the public extension.

If you specified a C<TypeNameAlias> when enabling the extension in this
account and Region, CloudFormation treats that alias as the extension's
type name within the account and Region, not the type name of the
public extension. For more information, see Use aliases to refer to
extensions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-alias)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 PublicVersionNumber => Str

For public extensions that have been activated for this account and
Region, the version of the public extension to be used for
CloudFormation operations in this account and Region.

How you specified C<AutoUpdate> when enabling the extension affects
whether CloudFormation automatically updates the extension in this
account and Region when a new version is released. For more
information, see Automatically use new versions of extensions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/registry-public.html#registry-public-enable-auto)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 PublisherId => Str

The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension is published by a
third party. Extensions published by Amazon don't return a publisher
ID.


=head2 PublisherIdentity => Str

The service used to verify the publisher identity.

For more information, see Publishing extensions to make them available
for public use
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/publish-extension.html)
in the I<CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide>.


=head2 PublisherName => Str

The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that publisher
in the service used to verify the publisher identity.


=head2 Type => Str

The kind of extension.


=head2 TypeArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.


=head2 TypeName => Str

The name of the extension.

If you specified a C<TypeNameAlias> when you call the ActivateType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html)
API operation in your account and Region, CloudFormation considers that
alias as the type name.
