=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ScanFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::ScanFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Types => $value, ..., Types => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::ScanFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Types

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter that is used to specify which resource types to scan.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Types => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of strings where each string represents an Amazon Web Services
resource type you want to scan. Each string defines the resource type
using the format C<AWS::ServiceName::ResourceType>, for example,
C<AWS::DynamoDB::Table>. For the full list of supported resource types,
see the Resource type support
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html)
table in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

To scan all resource types within a service, you can use a wildcard,
represented by an asterisk (C<*>). You can place a asterisk at only the
end of the string, for example, C<AWS::S3::*>.
