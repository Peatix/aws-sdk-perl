=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::WarningDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::WarningDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Properties => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::WarningDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Properties

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The warnings generated for a specific resource for this generated
template.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Properties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::WarningProperty>]

The properties of the resource that are impacted by this warning.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of this warning. For more information, see Resolve write-only
properties
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/generate-IaC-write-only-properties.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

=over

=item *

C<MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_PROPERTIES> - The resource requires
mutually-exclusive write-only properties. The IaC generator selects one
set of mutually exclusive properties and converts the included
properties into parameters. The parameter names have a suffix C<OneOf>
and the parameter descriptions indicate that the corresponding property
can be replaced with other exclusive properties.

=item *

C<UNSUPPORTED_PROPERTIES> - Unsupported properties are present in the
resource. One example of unsupported properties would be a required
write-only property that is an array, because a parameter cannot be an
array. Another example is an optional write-only property.

=item *

C<MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_TYPES> - One or more required write-only
properties are found in the resource, and the type of that property can
be any of several types.

=back

Currently the resource and property reference documentation does not
indicate if a property uses a type of C<oneOf> or C<anyOf>. You need to
look at the resource provider schema.
