=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::RegisterPublisher - Arguments for method RegisterPublisher on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method RegisterPublisher on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method RegisterPublisher.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to RegisterPublisher.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $RegisterPublisherOutput = $cloudformation->RegisterPublisher(
      AcceptTermsAndConditions => 1,                    # OPTIONAL
      ConnectionArn            => 'MyConnectionArn',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $PublisherId = $RegisterPublisherOutput->PublisherId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::RegisterPublisherOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/RegisterPublisher>
