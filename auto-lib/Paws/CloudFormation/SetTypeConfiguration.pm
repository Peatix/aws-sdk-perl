=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::SetTypeConfiguration - Arguments for method SetTypeConfiguration on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method SetTypeConfiguration on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method SetTypeConfiguration.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to SetTypeConfiguration.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $SetTypeConfigurationOutput = $cloudformation->SetTypeConfiguration(
      Configuration      => 'MyTypeConfiguration',
      ConfigurationAlias => 'MyTypeConfigurationAlias',    # OPTIONAL
      Type               => 'RESOURCE',                    # OPTIONAL
      TypeArn            => 'MyTypeArn',                   # OPTIONAL
      TypeName           => 'MyTypeName',                  # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ConfigurationArn = $SetTypeConfigurationOutput->ConfigurationArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::SetTypeConfigurationOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/SetTypeConfiguration>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Configuration => Str

The configuration data for the extension, in this account and Region.

The configuration data must be formatted as JSON, and validate against
the schema returned in the C<ConfigurationSchema> response element of
DescribeType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeType.html).
For more information, see Defining the account-level configuration of
an extension
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-model.html#resource-type-howto-configuration)
in the I<CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide>.



=head2 ConfigurationAlias => Str

An alias by which to refer to this extension configuration data.

Conditional: Specifying a configuration alias is required when setting
a configuration for a resource type extension.



=head2 Type => Str

The type of extension.

Conditional: You must specify C<ConfigurationArn>, or C<Type> and
C<TypeName>.

Valid values are: C<"RESOURCE">, C<"MODULE">, C<"HOOK">

=head2 TypeArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the extension, in this account and
Region.

For public extensions, this will be the ARN assigned when you call the
ActivateType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ActivateType.html)
API operation in this account and Region. For private extensions, this
will be the ARN assigned when you call the RegisterType
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_RegisterType.html)
API operation in this account and Region.

Do not include the extension versions suffix at the end of the ARN. You
can set the configuration for an extension, but not for a specific
extension version.



=head2 TypeName => Str

The name of the extension.

Conditional: You must specify C<ConfigurationArn>, or C<Type> and
C<TypeName>.
