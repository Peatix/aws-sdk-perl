=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ListTypes - Arguments for method ListTypes on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListTypes on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListTypes.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListTypes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $ListTypesOutput = $cloudformation->ListTypes(
      DeprecatedStatus => 'LIVE',    # OPTIONAL
      Filters          => {
        Category => 'REGISTERED'
        ,    # values: REGISTERED, ACTIVATED, THIRD_PARTY, AWS_TYPES; OPTIONAL
        PublisherId    => 'MyPublisherId',       # min: 1, max: 40; OPTIONAL
        TypeNamePrefix => 'MyTypeNamePrefix',    # min: 1, max: 204; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults       => 1,                      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken        => 'MyNextToken',          # OPTIONAL
      ProvisioningType => 'NON_PROVISIONABLE',    # OPTIONAL
      Type             => 'RESOURCE',             # OPTIONAL
      Visibility       => 'PUBLIC',               # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken     = $ListTypesOutput->NextToken;
    my $TypeSummaries = $ListTypesOutput->TypeSummaries;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::ListTypesOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/ListTypes>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeprecatedStatus => Str

The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary
information about.

Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<LIVE>: The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation
operations.

=item *

C<DEPRECATED>: The extension has been deregistered and can no longer be
used in CloudFormation operations.

=back


Valid values are: C<"LIVE">, C<"DEPRECATED">

=head2 Filters => L<Paws::CloudFormation::TypeFilters>

Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

Filters must be compatible with C<Visibility> to return valid results.
For example, specifying C<AWS_TYPES> for C<Category> and C<PRIVATE> for
C<Visibility> returns an empty list of types, but specifying C<PUBLIC>
for C<Visibility> returns the desired list.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the
number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes
a C<NextToken> value that you can assign to the C<NextToken> request
parameter to get the next set of results.



=head2 NextToken => Str

If the previous paginated request didn't return all the remaining
results, the response object's C<NextToken> parameter value is set to a
token. To retrieve the next set of results, call this action again and
assign that token to the request object's C<NextToken> parameter. If
there are no remaining results, the previous response object's
C<NextToken> parameter is set to C<null>.



=head2 ProvisioningType => Str

For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type.
CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration,
based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submitted.

Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<FULLY_MUTABLE>: The resource type includes an update handler to
process updates to the type during stack update operations.

=item *

C<IMMUTABLE>: The resource type doesn't include an update handler, so
the type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during stack
update operations.

=item *

C<NON_PROVISIONABLE>: The resource type doesn't include create, read,
and delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.

=back

The default is C<FULLY_MUTABLE>.

Valid values are: C<"NON_PROVISIONABLE">, C<"IMMUTABLE">, C<"FULLY_MUTABLE">

=head2 Type => Str

The type of extension.

Valid values are: C<"RESOURCE">, C<"MODULE">, C<"HOOK">

=head2 Visibility => Str

The scope at which the extensions are visible and usable in
CloudFormation operations.

Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<PRIVATE>: Extensions that are visible and usable within this account
and Region. This includes:

=over

=item *

Private extensions you have registered in this account and Region.

=item *

Public extensions that you have activated in this account and Region.

=back

=item *

C<PUBLIC>: Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be
activated within any Amazon Web Services account. This includes
extensions from Amazon Web Services, in addition to third-party
publishers.

=back

The default is C<PRIVATE>.

Valid values are: C<"PUBLIC">, C<"PRIVATE">
