=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::DeploymentTargets

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::DeploymentTargets object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountFilterType => $value, ..., OrganizationalUnitIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::DeploymentTargets object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountFilterType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

[Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts to which
StackSets deploys. StackSets doesn't deploy stack instances to the
organization management account, even if the organization management
account is in your organization or in an OU in your organization.

For update operations, you can specify either C<Accounts> or
C<OrganizationalUnitIds>. For create and delete operations, specify
C<OrganizationalUnitIds>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountFilterType => Str

Limit deployment targets to individual accounts or include additional
accounts with provided OUs.

The following is a list of possible values for the C<AccountFilterType>
operation.

=over

=item *

C<INTERSECTION>: StackSets deploys to the accounts specified in
C<Accounts> parameter.

=item *

C<DIFFERENCE>: StackSets excludes the accounts specified in C<Accounts>
parameter. This enables user to avoid certain accounts within an OU
such as suspended accounts.

=item *

C<UNION>: StackSets includes additional accounts deployment targets.

This is the default value if C<AccountFilterType> is not provided. This
enables user to update an entire OU and individual accounts from a
different OU in one request, which used to be two separate requests.

=item *

C<NONE>: Deploys to all the accounts in specified organizational units
(OU).

=back



=head2 Accounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The account IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts. If you have many
account numbers, you can provide those accounts using the
C<AccountsUrl> property instead.


=head2 AccountsUrl => Str

The Amazon S3 URL path to a file that contains a list of Amazon Web
Services account IDs. The file format must be either C<.csv> or
C<.txt>, and the data can be comma-separated or new-line-separated.
There is currently a 10MB limit for the data (approximately 800,000
accounts).


=head2 OrganizationalUnitIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The organization root ID or organizational unit (OU) IDs.
