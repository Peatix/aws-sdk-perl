=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LogicalResourceId => $value, ..., Timestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceResourceDriftsSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LogicalResourceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure containing summary information about resource drifts for
a stack instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogicalResourceId => Str

The logical name of the resource specified in the template.


=head2 PhysicalResourceId => Str

The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical instance
ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.


=head2 PhysicalResourceIdContext => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::PhysicalResourceIdContextKeyValuePair>]

Context information that enables CloudFormation to uniquely identify a
resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs in cases where a
resource's logical and physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify
that resource. Each context key-value pair specifies a unique resource
that contains the targeted resource.


=head2 PropertyDifferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::PropertyDifference>]

Status of the actual configuration of the resource compared to its
expected configuration. These will be present only for resources whose
C<StackInstanceResourceDriftStatus> is C<MODIFIED>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceType => Str

Type of resource. For more information, see Amazon Web Services
resource and property types reference
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StackId => Str

The ID of the stack instance.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StackResourceDriftStatus => Str

The drift status of the resource in a stack instance.

=over

=item *

C<DELETED>: The resource differs from its expected template
configuration in that the resource has been deleted.

=item *

C<MODIFIED>: One or more resource properties differ from their expected
template values.

=item *

C<IN_SYNC>: The resource's actual configuration matches its expected
template configuration.

=item *

C<NOT_CHECKED>: CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Timestamp => Str

Time at which the stack instance drift detection operation was
initiated.
