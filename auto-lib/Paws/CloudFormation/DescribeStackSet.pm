=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::DescribeStackSet - Arguments for method DescribeStackSet on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeStackSet on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeStackSet.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeStackSet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $DescribeStackSetOutput = $cloudformation->DescribeStackSet(
      StackSetName => 'MyStackSetName',
      CallAs       => 'SELF',             # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $StackSet = $DescribeStackSetOutput->StackSet;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::DescribeStackSetOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
