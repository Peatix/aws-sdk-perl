=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationPreferences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationPreferences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConcurrencyMode => $value, ..., RegionOrder => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationPreferences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConcurrencyMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The user-specified preferences for how CloudFormation performs a stack
set operation.

For more information about maximum concurrent accounts and failure
tolerance, see Stack set operation options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html#stackset-ops-options).

C<StackSetOperationPreferences> don't apply to C<AutoDeployment>, even
if it's enabled.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConcurrencyMode => Str

Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation
execution.

=over

=item *

C<STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE>: This option dynamically lowers the
concurrency level to ensure the number of failed accounts never exceeds
the value of C<FailureToleranceCount> +1. The initial actual
concurrency is set to the lower of either the value of the
C<MaxConcurrentCount>, or the value of C<FailureToleranceCount> +1. The
actual concurrency is then reduced proportionally by the number of
failures. This is the default behavior.

If failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are set to
percentages, the behavior is similar.

=item *

C<SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE>: This option decouples
C<FailureToleranceCount> from the actual concurrency. This allows stack
set operations to run at the concurrency level set by the
C<MaxConcurrentCount> value, or C<MaxConcurrentPercentage>, regardless
of the number of failures.

=back



=head2 FailureToleranceCount => Int

The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can fail
before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If the
operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt the
operation in any subsequent Regions.

Conditional: You must specify either C<FailureToleranceCount> or
C<FailureTolerancePercentage> (but not both).

By default, C<0> is specified.


=head2 FailureTolerancePercentage => Int

The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack operation
can fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region. If
the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't attempt
the operation in any subsequent Regions.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified
percentage, CloudFormation rounds I<down> to the next whole number.

Conditional: You must specify either C<FailureToleranceCount> or
C<FailureTolerancePercentage>, but not both.

By default, C<0> is specified.


=head2 MaxConcurrentCount => Int

The maximum number of accounts in which to perform this operation at
one time. This can depend on the value of C<FailureToleranceCount>
depending on your C<ConcurrencyMode>. C<MaxConcurrentCount> is at most
one more than the C<FailureToleranceCount> if you're using
C<STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE>.

Note that this setting lets you specify the I<maximum> for operations.
For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of
accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service
throttling.

Conditional: You must specify either C<MaxConcurrentCount> or
C<MaxConcurrentPercentage>, but not both.

By default, C<1> is specified.


=head2 MaxConcurrentPercentage => Int

The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this operation
at one time.

When calculating the number of accounts based on the specified
percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number. This
is true except in cases where rounding down would result is zero. In
this case, CloudFormation sets the number as one instead.

Note that this setting lets you specify the I<maximum> for operations.
For large deployments, under certain circumstances the actual number of
accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower due to service
throttling.

Conditional: You must specify either C<MaxConcurrentCount> or
C<MaxConcurrentPercentage>, but not both.

By default, C<1> is specified.


=head2 RegionConcurrencyType => Str

The concurrency type of deploying StackSets operations in Regions,
could be in parallel or one Region at a time.


=head2 RegionOrder => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack operation.
