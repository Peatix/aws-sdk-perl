=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LogicalResourceId => $value, ..., Warnings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LogicalResourceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about a resource in a generated template

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LogicalResourceId => Str

The logical id for this resource in the final generated template.


=head2 ResourceIdentifier => L<Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceIdentifierProperties>

A list of up to 256 key-value pairs that identifies the resource in the
generated template. The key is the name of one of the primary
identifiers for the resource. (Primary identifiers are specified in the
C<primaryIdentifier> list in the resource schema.) The value is the
value of that primary identifier. For example, for a
C<AWS::DynamoDB::Table> resource, the primary identifiers is
C<TableName> so the key-value pair could be C<"TableName":
"MyDDBTable">. For more information, see primaryIdentifier
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-schema.html#schema-properties-primaryidentifier)
in the I<CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide>.


=head2 ResourceStatus => Str

Status of the processing of a resource in a generated template.

=over

=item InProgress

The resource processing is still in progress.

=item Complete

The resource processing is complete.

=item Pending

The resource processing is pending.

=item Failed

The resource processing has failed.

=back



=head2 ResourceStatusReason => Str

The reason for the resource detail, providing more information if a
failure happened.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of the resource, such as C<AWS::DynamoDB::Table>. For the list
of supported resources, see Resource type support for imports and drift
detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import-supported-resources.html)
In the I<CloudFormation User Guide>


=head2 Warnings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::WarningDetail>]

The warnings generated for this resource.
