=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::DeleteStackInstances - Arguments for method DeleteStackInstances on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteStackInstances on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteStackInstances.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteStackInstances.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $DeleteStackInstancesOutput = $cloudformation->DeleteStackInstances(
      Regions           => [ 'MyRegion', ... ],
      RetainStacks      => 1,
      StackSetName      => 'MyStackSetName',
      Accounts          => [ 'MyAccount', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
      CallAs            => 'SELF',                  # OPTIONAL
      DeploymentTargets => {
        AccountFilterType =>
          'NONE',    # values: NONE, INTERSECTION, DIFFERENCE, UNION; OPTIONAL
        Accounts    => [ 'MyAccount', ... ],
        AccountsUrl => 'MyAccountsUrl',        # min: 1, max: 5120; OPTIONAL
        OrganizationalUnitIds => [ 'MyOrganizationalUnitId', ... ],   # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      OperationId          => 'MyClientRequestToken',    # OPTIONAL
      OperationPreferences => {
        ConcurrencyMode => 'STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE'
        ,   # values: STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE, SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE; OPTIONAL
        FailureToleranceCount      => 1,    # OPTIONAL
        FailureTolerancePercentage => 1,    # max: 100; OPTIONAL
        MaxConcurrentCount         => 1,    # min: 1; OPTIONAL
        MaxConcurrentPercentage    => 1,    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
        RegionConcurrencyType      =>
          'SEQUENTIAL',    # values: SEQUENTIAL, PARALLEL; OPTIONAL
        RegionOrder => [ 'MyRegion', ... ],
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $OperationId = $DeleteStackInstancesOutput->OperationId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::DeleteStackInstancesOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/DeleteStackInstances>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

[Self-managed permissions] The account IDs of the Amazon Web Services
accounts that you want to delete stack instances for.

You can specify C<Accounts> or C<DeploymentTargets>, but not both.



=head2 CallAs => Str

[Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
account administrator in the organization's management account or as a
delegated administrator in a member account.

By default, C<SELF> is specified. Use C<SELF> for stack sets with
self-managed permissions.

=over

=item *

If you are signed in to the management account, specify C<SELF>.

=item *

If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
C<DELEGATED_ADMIN>.

Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated
administrator in the management account. For more information, see
Register a delegated administrator
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

=back


Valid values are: C<"SELF">, C<"DELEGATED_ADMIN">

=head2 DeploymentTargets => L<Paws::CloudFormation::DeploymentTargets>

[Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts from which to
delete stack instances.

You can specify C<Accounts> or C<DeploymentTargets>, but not both.



=head2 OperationId => Str

The unique identifier for this stack set operation.

If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one
automatically.

The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that
CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you
retry the request multiple times. You can retry stack set operation
requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.

Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all
stack instances whose status is C<OUTDATED>.



=head2 OperationPreferences => L<Paws::CloudFormation::StackSetOperationPreferences>

Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Regions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Web Services Regions where you want to delete stack set
instances.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RetainStacks => Bool

Removes the stack instances from the specified stack set, but doesn't
delete the stacks. You can't reassociate a retained stack or add an
existing, saved stack to a new stack set.

For more information, see Stack set operation options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html#stackset-ops-options).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> StackSetName => Str

The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to delete stack
instances for.
