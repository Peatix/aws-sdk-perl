=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::AccountGateResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::AccountGateResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Status => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::AccountGateResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Status

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Structure that contains the results of the account gate function which
CloudFormation invokes, if present, before proceeding with a stack set
operation in an account and Region.

For each account and Region, CloudFormation lets you specify a Lambda
function that encapsulates any requirements that must be met before
CloudFormation can proceed with a stack set operation in that account
and Region. CloudFormation invokes the function each time a stack set
operation is requested for that account and Region; if the function
returns C<FAILED>, CloudFormation cancels the operation in that account
and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that
account and Region to C<FAILED>.

For more information, see Configuring a target account gate in
StackSets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-account-gating.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the account gate function.

=over

=item *

C<SUCCEEDED>: The account gate function has determined that the account
and Region passes any requirements for a stack set operation to occur.
CloudFormation proceeds with the stack operation in that account and
Region.

=item *

C<FAILED>: The account gate function has determined that the account
and Region doesn't meet the requirements for a stack set operation to
occur. CloudFormation cancels the stack set operation in that account
and Region, and sets the stack set operation result status for that
account and Region to C<FAILED>.

=item *

C<SKIPPED>: CloudFormation has skipped calling the account gate
function for this account and Region, for one of the following reasons:

=over

=item *

An account gate function hasn't been specified for the account and
Region. CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this
account and Region.

=item *

The C<AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole> of the stack set
administration account lacks permissions to invoke the function.
CloudFormation proceeds with the stack set operation in this account
and Region.

=item *

Either no action is necessary, or no action is possible, on the stack.
CloudFormation skips the stack set operation in this account and
Region.

=back

=back



=head2 StatusReason => Str

The reason for the account gate status assigned to this account and
Region for the stack set operation.
