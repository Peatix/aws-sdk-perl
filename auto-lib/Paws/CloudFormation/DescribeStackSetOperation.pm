=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::DescribeStackSetOperation - Arguments for method DescribeStackSetOperation on L<Paws::CloudFormation>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeStackSetOperation on the
L<AWS CloudFormation|Paws::CloudFormation> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeStackSetOperation.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeStackSetOperation.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudformation = Paws->service('CloudFormation');
    my $DescribeStackSetOperationOutput =
      $cloudformation->DescribeStackSetOperation(
      OperationId  => 'MyClientRequestToken',
      StackSetName => 'MyStackSetName',
      CallAs       => 'SELF',                   # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $StackSetOperation = $DescribeStackSetOperationOutput->StackSetOperation;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudFormation::DescribeStackSetOperationOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/cloudformation/DescribeStackSetOperation>
