=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceChange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceChange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Scope => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceChange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ResourceChange> structure describes the resource and the action
that CloudFormation will perform on it if you execute this change set.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => Str

The action that CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as C<Add>
(adds a new resource), C<Modify> (changes a resource), C<Remove>
(deletes a resource), C<Import> (imports a resource), or C<Dynamic>
(exact action for the resource can't be determined).


=head2 AfterContext => Str

An encoded JSON string containing the context of the resource after the
change is executed.


=head2 BeforeContext => Str

An encoded JSON string containing the context of the resource before
the change is executed.


=head2 ChangeSetId => Str

The change set ID of the nested change set.


=head2 Details => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceChangeDetail>]

For the C<Modify> action, a list of C<ResourceChangeDetail> structures
that describes the changes that CloudFormation will make to the
resource.


=head2 LogicalResourceId => Str

The resource's logical ID, which is defined in the stack's template.


=head2 ModuleInfo => L<Paws::CloudFormation::ModuleInfo>

Contains information about the module from which the resource was
created, if the resource was created from a module included in the
stack template.


=head2 PhysicalResourceId => Str

The resource's physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are
adding don't have physical IDs because they haven't been created.


=head2 PolicyAction => Str

The action that will be taken on the physical resource when the change
set is executed.

=over

=item *

C<Delete> The resource will be deleted.

=item *

C<Retain> The resource will be retained.

=item *

C<Snapshot> The resource will have a snapshot taken.

=item *

C<ReplaceAndDelete> The resource will be replaced and then deleted.

=item *

C<ReplaceAndRetain> The resource will be replaced and then retained.

=item *

C<ReplaceAndSnapshot> The resource will be replaced and then have a
snapshot taken.

=back



=head2 Replacement => Str

For the C<Modify> action, indicates whether CloudFormation will replace
the resource by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value
depends on the value of the C<RequiresRecreation> property in the
C<ResourceTargetDefinition> structure. For example, if the
C<RequiresRecreation> field is C<Always> and the C<Evaluation> field is
C<Static>, C<Replacement> is C<True>. If the C<RequiresRecreation>
field is C<Always> and the C<Evaluation> field is C<Dynamic>,
C<Replacement> is C<Conditional>.

If you have multiple changes with different C<RequiresRecreation>
values, the C<Replacement> value depends on the change with the most
impact. A C<RequiresRecreation> value of C<Always> has the most impact,
followed by C<Conditional>, and then C<Never>.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of CloudFormation resource, such as C<AWS::S3::Bucket>.


=head2 Scope => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

For the C<Modify> action, indicates which resource attribute is
triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute's
C<Metadata>, C<Properties>, or C<Tags>.
