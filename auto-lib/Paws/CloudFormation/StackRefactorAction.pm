=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackRefactorAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackRefactorAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., UntagResources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackRefactorAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the stack and the action that CloudFormation will perform on
it if you execute the stack refactor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => Str

The action that CloudFormation takes on the stack.


=head2 Description => Str

A description to help you identify the refactor.


=head2 Detection => Str

The detection type is one of the following:

=over

=item *

Auto: CloudFormation figured out the mapping on its own.

=item *

Manual: The customer provided the mapping in the C<ResourceMapping>
parameter.

=back



=head2 DetectionReason => Str

The description of the detection type.


=head2 Entity => Str

The type that will be evaluated in the C<StackRefactorAction>. The
following are potential C<Entity> types:

=over

=item *

C<Stack>

=item *

C<Resource>

=back



=head2 PhysicalResourceId => Str

The name or unique identifier associated with the physical instance of
the resource.


=head2 ResourceIdentifier => Str

A key-value pair that identifies the target resource. The key is an
identifier property (for example, C<BucketName> for C<AWS::S3::Bucket>
resources) and the value is the actual property value (for example,
C<MyS3Bucket>).


=head2 ResourceMapping => L<Paws::CloudFormation::ResourceMapping>

The mapping for the stack resource C<Source> and stack resource
C<Destination>.


=head2 TagResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::Tag>]

Assigns one or more tags to specified resources.


=head2 UntagResources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Removes one or more tags to specified resources.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::CloudFormation>
