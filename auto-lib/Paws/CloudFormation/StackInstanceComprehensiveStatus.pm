=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DetailedStatus => $value, ..., DetailedStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::StackInstanceComprehensiveStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DetailedStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The detailed status of the stack instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DetailedStatus => Str

=over

=item *

C<CANCELLED>: The operation in the specified account and Region has
been canceled. This is either because a user has stopped the stack set
operation, or because the failure tolerance of the stack set operation
has been exceeded.

=item *

C<FAILED>: The operation in the specified account and Region failed. If
the stack set operation fails in enough accounts within a Region, the
failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole might be
exceeded.

=item *

C<FAILED_IMPORT>: The import of the stack instance in the specified
account and Region failed and left the stack in an unstable state. Once
the issues causing the failure are fixed, the import operation can be
retried. If enough stack set operations fail in enough accounts within
a Region, the failure tolerance for the stack set operation as a whole
might be exceeded.

=item *

C<INOPERABLE>: A C<DeleteStackInstances> operation has failed and left
the stack in an unstable state. Stacks in this state are excluded from
further C<UpdateStackSet> operations. You might need to perform a
C<DeleteStackInstances> operation, with C<RetainStacks> set to C<true>,
to delete the stack instance, and then delete the stack manually.

=item *

C<PENDING>: The operation in the specified account and Region has yet
to start.

=item *

C<RUNNING>: The operation in the specified account and Region is
currently in progress.

=item *

C<SKIPPED_SUSPENDED_ACCOUNT>: The operation in the specified account
and Region has been skipped because the account was suspended at the
time of the operation.

=item *

C<SUCCEEDED>: The operation in the specified account and Region
completed successfully.
