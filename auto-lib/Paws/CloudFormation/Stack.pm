=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::Stack

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::Stack object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Capabilities => $value, ..., TimeoutInMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::Stack object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Capabilities

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Stack data type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Capabilities => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The capabilities allowed in the stack.


=head2 ChangeSetId => Str

The unique ID of the change set.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The time at which the stack was created.


=head2 DeletionMode => Str

Specifies the deletion mode for the stack. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

C<STANDARD> - Use the standard behavior. Specifying this value is the
same as not specifying this parameter.

=item *

C<FORCE_DELETE_STACK> - Delete the stack if it's stuck in a
C<DELETE_FAILED> state due to resource deletion failure.

=back



=head2 DeletionTime => Str

The time the stack was deleted.


=head2 Description => Str

A user-defined description associated with the stack.


=head2 DetailedStatus => Str

The detailed status of the resource or stack. If
C<CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE> is present, the resource or resource
configuration phase has completed and the stabilization of the
resources is in progress. The stack sets C<CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE> when
all of the resources in the stack have reached that event. For more
information, see Understand CloudFormation stack creation events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stack-resource-configuration-complete.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 DisableRollback => Bool

Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures:

=over

=item *

C<true>: disable rollback.

=item *

C<false>: enable rollback.

=back



=head2 DriftInformation => L<Paws::CloudFormation::StackDriftInformation>

Information about whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or
has I<drifted>, from its expected configuration, as defined in the
stack template and any values specified as template parameters. For
more information, see Detect unmanaged configuration changes to stacks
and resources with drift detection
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-stack-drift.html).


=head2 EnableTerminationProtection => Bool

Whether termination protection is enabled for the stack.

For nested stacks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html),
termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed
directly on the nested stack. For more information, see Protect a
CloudFormation stack from being deleted
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-protect-stacks.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The time the stack was last updated. This field will only be returned
if the stack has been updated at least once.


=head2 NotificationARNs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Amazon SNS topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to which stack related
events are published.


=head2 Outputs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::Output>]

A list of output structures.


=head2 Parameters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::Parameter>]

A list of C<Parameter> structures.


=head2 ParentId => Str

For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the
stack ID of the direct parent of this stack. For the first level of
nested stacks, the root stack is also the parent stack.

For more information, see Embed stacks within other stacks using nested
stacks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 RetainExceptOnCreate => Bool

When set to C<true>, newly created resources are deleted when the
operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with
a deletion policy of C<Retain>.

Default: C<false>


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that's associated with
the stack. During a stack operation, CloudFormation uses this role's
credentials to make calls on your behalf.


=head2 RollbackConfiguration => L<Paws::CloudFormation::RollbackConfiguration>

The rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack
creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
period afterwards.


=head2 RootId => Str

For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the
stack ID of the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately
belongs.

For more information, see Embed stacks within other stacks using nested
stacks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-nested-stacks.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 StackId => Str

Unique identifier of the stack.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StackName => Str

The name associated with the stack.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StackStatus => Str

Current status of the stack.


=head2 StackStatusReason => Str

Success/failure message associated with the stack status.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFormation::Tag>]

A list of C<Tag>s that specify information about the stack.


=head2 TimeoutInMinutes => Int

The amount of time within which stack creation should complete.
