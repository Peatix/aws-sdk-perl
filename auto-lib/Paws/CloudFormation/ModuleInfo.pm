=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFormation::ModuleInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFormation::ModuleInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LogicalIdHierarchy => $value, ..., TypeHierarchy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFormation::ModuleInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LogicalIdHierarchy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the module from which the resource was
created, if the resource was created from a module included in the
stack template.

For more information about modules, see Create reusable resource
configurations that can be included across templates with
CloudFormation modules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/modules.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LogicalIdHierarchy => Str

A concatenated list of the logical IDs of the module or modules
containing the resource. Modules are listed starting with the
inner-most nested module, and separated by C</>.

In the following example, the resource was created from a module,
C<moduleA>, that's nested inside a parent module, C<moduleB>.

C<moduleA/moduleB>

For more information, see Reference module resources in CloudFormation
templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/module-ref-resources.html)
in the I<CloudFormation User Guide>.


=head2 TypeHierarchy => Str

A concatenated list of the module type or types containing the
resource. Module types are listed starting with the inner-most nested
module, and separated by C</>.

In the following example, the resource was created from a module of
type C<AWS::First::Example::MODULE>, that's nested inside a parent
module of type C<AWS::Second::Example::MODULE>.

C<AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE>
