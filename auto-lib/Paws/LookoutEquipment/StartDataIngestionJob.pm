=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutequipment = Paws->service('LookoutEquipment');
    my $StartDataIngestionJobResponse =
      $lookoutequipment->StartDataIngestionJob(
      ClientToken                 => 'MyIdempotenceToken',
      DatasetName                 => 'MyDatasetIdentifier',
      IngestionInputConfiguration => {
        S3InputConfiguration => {
          Bucket     => 'MyS3Bucket',      # min: 3, max: 63
          KeyPattern => 'MyKeyPattern',    # min: 1, max: 2048; OPTIONAL
          Prefix     => 'MyS3Prefix',      # max: 1024; OPTIONAL
        },

      },
      RoleArn => 'MyIamRoleArn',

      );

    # Results:
    my $JobId  = $StartDataIngestionJobResponse->JobId;
    my $Status = $StartDataIngestionJobResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::StartDataIngestionJobResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
