=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateDataset - Arguments for method CreateDataset on L<Paws::LookoutEquipment>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDataset on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Equipment|Paws::LookoutEquipment> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDataset.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDataset.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutequipment = Paws->service('LookoutEquipment');
    my $CreateDatasetResponse = $lookoutequipment->CreateDataset(
      ClientToken   => 'MyIdempotenceToken',
      DatasetName   => 'MyDatasetName',
      DatasetSchema => {
        InlineDataSchema =>
          'MyInlineDataSchema',    # min: 1, max: 1000000; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      ServerSideKmsKeyId => 'MyNameOrArn',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags               => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DatasetArn  = $CreateDatasetResponse->DatasetArn;
    my $DatasetName = $CreateDatasetResponse->DatasetName;
    my $Status      = $CreateDatasetResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateDatasetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
