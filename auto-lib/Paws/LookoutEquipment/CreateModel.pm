=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateModel - Arguments for method CreateModel on L<Paws::LookoutEquipment>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateModel on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Equipment|Paws::LookoutEquipment> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateModel.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateModel.

    # Results:
    my $ModelArn = $CreateModelResponse->ModelArn;
    my $Status   = $CreateModelResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateModelResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientToken => Str

A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client
request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.



=head2 DataPreProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::DataPreProcessingConfiguration>

The configuration is the C<TargetSamplingRate>, which is the sampling
rate of the data after post processing by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.
For example, if you provide data that has been collected at a 1 second
level and you want the system to resample the data at a 1 minute rate
before training, the C<TargetSamplingRate> is 1 minute.

When providing a value for the C<TargetSamplingRate>, you must attach
the prefix "PT" to the rate you want. The value for a 1 second rate is
therefore I<PT1S>, the value for a 15 minute rate is I<PT15M>, and the
value for a 1 hour rate is I<PT1H>



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetName => Str

The name of the dataset for the machine learning model being created.



=head2 DatasetSchema => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::DatasetSchema>

The data schema for the machine learning model being created.



=head2 EvaluationDataEndTime => Str

Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to end
the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.



=head2 EvaluationDataStartTime => Str

Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to
begin the subset of evaluation data for the machine learning model.



=head2 LabelsInputConfiguration => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::LabelsInputConfiguration>

The input configuration for the labels being used for the machine
learning model that's being created.



=head2 ModelDiagnosticsOutputConfiguration => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::ModelDiagnosticsOutputConfiguration>

The Amazon S3 location where you want Amazon Lookout for Equipment to
save the pointwise model diagnostics. You must also specify the
C<RoleArn> request parameter.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelName => Str

The name for the machine learning model to be created.



=head2 OffCondition => Str

Indicates that the asset associated with this sensor has been shut off.
As long as this condition is met, Lookout for Equipment will not use
data from this asset for training, evaluation, or inference.



=head2 RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the
data source being used to create the machine learning model.



=head2 ServerSideKmsKeyId => Str

Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt model data by
Amazon Lookout for Equipment.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::Tag>]

Any tags associated with the machine learning model being created.



=head2 TrainingDataEndTime => Str

Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to end
the subset of training data for the machine learning model.



=head2 TrainingDataStartTime => Str

Indicates the time reference in the dataset that should be used to
begin the subset of training data for the machine learning model.
