=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::ListModels - Arguments for method ListModels on L<Paws::LookoutEquipment>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListModels on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Equipment|Paws::LookoutEquipment> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListModels.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListModels.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutequipment = Paws->service('LookoutEquipment');
    my $ListModelsResponse = $lookoutequipment->ListModels(
      DatasetNameBeginsWith => 'MyDatasetName',    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults            => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      ModelNameBeginsWith   => 'MyModelName',      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken             => 'MyNextToken',      # OPTIONAL
      Status                => 'IN_PROGRESS',      # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ModelSummaries = $ListModelsResponse->ModelSummaries;
    my $NextToken      = $ListModelsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::ListModelsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lookoutequipment/ListModels>
