=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::SensorStatisticsSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutEquipment::SensorStatisticsSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CategoricalValues => $value, ..., SensorName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutEquipment::SensorStatisticsSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CategoricalValues

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary of ingestion statistics like whether data exists, number of
missing values, number of invalid values and so on related to the
particular sensor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CategoricalValues => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CategoricalValues>

Parameter that describes potential risk about whether data associated
with the sensor is categorical.


=head2 ComponentName => Str

Name of the component to which the particular sensor belongs for which
the statistics belong to.


=head2 DataEndTime => Str

Indicates the time reference to indicate the end of valid data
associated with the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 DataExists => Bool

Parameter that indicates whether data exists for the sensor that the
statistics belong to.


=head2 DataStartTime => Str

Indicates the time reference to indicate the beginning of valid data
associated with the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 DuplicateTimestamps => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CountPercent>

Parameter that describes the total number of duplicate timestamp
records associated with the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 InvalidDateEntries => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CountPercent>

Parameter that describes the total number of invalid date entries
associated with the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 InvalidValues => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CountPercent>

Parameter that describes the total number of, and percentage of, values
that are invalid for the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 LargeTimestampGaps => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::LargeTimestampGaps>

Parameter that describes potential risk about whether data associated
with the sensor contains one or more large gaps between consecutive
timestamps.


=head2 MissingValues => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CountPercent>

Parameter that describes the total number of, and percentage of, values
that are missing for the sensor that the statistics belong to.


=head2 MonotonicValues => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::MonotonicValues>

Parameter that describes potential risk about whether data associated
with the sensor is mostly monotonic.


=head2 MultipleOperatingModes => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::MultipleOperatingModes>

Parameter that describes potential risk about whether data associated
with the sensor has more than one operating mode.


=head2 SensorName => Str

Name of the sensor that the statistics belong to.
