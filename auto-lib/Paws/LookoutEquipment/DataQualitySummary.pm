=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::DataQualitySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutEquipment::DataQualitySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DuplicateTimestamps => $value, ..., UnsupportedTimestamps => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutEquipment::DataQualitySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DuplicateTimestamps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DataQualitySummary gives aggregated statistics over all the sensors
about a completed ingestion job. It primarily gives more information
about statistics over different incorrect data like
MissingCompleteSensorData, MissingSensorData, UnsupportedDateFormats,
InsufficientSensorData, DuplicateTimeStamps.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DuplicateTimestamps => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::DuplicateTimestamps>

Parameter that gives information about duplicate timestamps in the
input data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InsufficientSensorData => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::InsufficientSensorData>

Parameter that gives information about insufficient data for sensors in
the dataset. This includes information about those sensors that have
complete data missing and those with a short date range.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InvalidSensorData => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::InvalidSensorData>

Parameter that gives information about data that is invalid over all
the sensors in the input data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MissingSensorData => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::MissingSensorData>

Parameter that gives information about data that is missing over all
the sensors in the input data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UnsupportedTimestamps => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::UnsupportedTimestamps>

Parameter that gives information about unsupported timestamps in the
input data.
