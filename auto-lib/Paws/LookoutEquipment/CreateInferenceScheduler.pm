=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateInferenceScheduler - Arguments for method CreateInferenceScheduler on L<Paws::LookoutEquipment>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateInferenceScheduler on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Equipment|Paws::LookoutEquipment> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateInferenceScheduler.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateInferenceScheduler.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutequipment = Paws->service('LookoutEquipment');
    my $CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse =
      $lookoutequipment->CreateInferenceScheduler(
      ClientToken            => 'MyIdempotenceToken',
      DataInputConfiguration => {
        InferenceInputNameConfiguration => {

          TimestampFormat => 'MyFileNameTimestampFormat',    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL

    # Results:
    my $InferenceSchedulerArn =
      $CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse->InferenceSchedulerArn;
    my $InferenceSchedulerName =
      $CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse->InferenceSchedulerName;
    my $ModelQuality = $CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse->ModelQuality;
    my $Status       = $CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse->Status;

 # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::CreateInferenceSchedulerResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientToken => Str

A unique identifier for the request. If you do not set the client
request token, Amazon Lookout for Equipment generates one.



=head2 DataDelayOffsetInMinutes => Int

The interval (in minutes) of planned delay at the start of each
inference segment. For example, if inference is set to run every ten
minutes, the delay is set to five minutes and the time is 09:08. The
inference scheduler will wake up at the configured interval (which,
without a delay configured, would be 09:10) plus the additional five
minute delay time (so 09:15) to check your Amazon S3 bucket. The delay
provides a buffer for you to upload data at the same frequency, so that
you don't have to stop and restart the scheduler when uploading new
data.

For more information, see Understanding the inference process
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-equipment/latest/ug/understanding-inference-process.html).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataInputConfiguration => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::InferenceInputConfiguration>

Specifies configuration information for the input data for the
inference scheduler, including delimiter, format, and dataset location.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataOutputConfiguration => L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::InferenceOutputConfiguration>

Specifies configuration information for the output results for the
inference scheduler, including the S3 location for the output.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataUploadFrequency => Str

How often data is uploaded to the source Amazon S3 bucket for the input
data. The value chosen is the length of time between data uploads. For
instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will
upload the real-time data to the source bucket once every 5 minutes.
This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout for Equipment
runs inference on your data.

For more information, see Understanding the inference process
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lookout-for-equipment/latest/ug/understanding-inference-process.html).

Valid values are: C<"PT5M">, C<"PT10M">, C<"PT15M">, C<"PT30M">, C<"PT1H">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> InferenceSchedulerName => Str

The name of the inference scheduler being created.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelName => Str

The name of the previously trained machine learning model being used to
create the inference scheduler.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to access the
data source being used for the inference.



=head2 ServerSideKmsKeyId => Str

Provides the identifier of the KMS key used to encrypt inference
scheduler data by Amazon Lookout for Equipment.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::Tag>]

Any tags associated with the inference scheduler.
