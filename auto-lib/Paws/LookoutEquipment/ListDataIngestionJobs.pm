=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutequipment = Paws->service('LookoutEquipment');
    my $ListDataIngestionJobsResponse =
      $lookoutequipment->ListDataIngestionJobs(
      DatasetName => 'MyDatasetName',    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults  => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      NextToken   => 'MyNextToken',      # OPTIONAL
      Status      => 'IN_PROGRESS',      # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $DataIngestionJobSummaries =
      $ListDataIngestionJobsResponse->DataIngestionJobSummaries;
    my $NextToken = $ListDataIngestionJobsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutEquipment::ListDataIngestionJobsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
