  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., Prefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutEquipment::IngestionS3InputConfiguration object:

ingestion job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The name of the S3 bucket used for the input data for the data
ingestion.


=head2 KeyPattern => Str

The pattern for matching the Amazon S3 files that will be used for
ingestion. If the schema was created previously without any KeyPattern,
then the default KeyPattern {prefix}/{component_name}/* is used to
download files from Amazon S3 according to the schema. This field is
required when ingestion is being done for the first time.

Valid Values: {prefix}/{component_name}_* | {prefix}/{component_name}/*
| {prefix}/{component_name}[DELIMITER]* (Allowed delimiters : space,
dot, underscore, hyphen)


=head2 Prefix => Str

The prefix for the S3 location being used for the input data for the
