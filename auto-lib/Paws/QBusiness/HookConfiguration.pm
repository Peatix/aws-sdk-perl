=head1 NAME

Paws::QBusiness::HookConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QBusiness::HookConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InvocationCondition => $value, ..., S3BucketName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QBusiness::HookConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InvocationCondition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information for invoking a Lambda function
in Lambda to alter document metadata and content when ingesting
documents into Amazon Q Business.

You can configure your Lambda function using the
C<PreExtractionHookConfiguration> parameter if you want to apply
advanced alterations on the original or raw documents.

If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon Q Business
structured documents, you must configure your Lambda function using
C<PostExtractionHookConfiguration>.

You can only invoke one Lambda function. However, this function can
invoke other functions it requires.

For more information, see Custom document enrichment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/custom-document-enrichment.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InvocationCondition => L<Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeCondition>

The condition used for when a Lambda function should be invoked.

For example, you can specify a condition that if there are empty
date-time values, then Amazon Q Business should invoke a function that
inserts the current date-time.


=head2 LambdaArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function sduring
ingestion. For more information, see Using Lambda functions for Amazon
Q Business document enrichment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/cde-lambda-operations.html).


=head2 RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a role with permission to run
C<PreExtractionHookConfiguration> and
C<PostExtractionHookConfiguration> for altering document metadata and
content during the document ingestion process.


=head2 S3BucketName => Str

Stores the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed documents
before and after altering them. For more information, see Data
contracts for Lambda functions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/cde-lambda-operations.html#cde-lambda-operations-data-contracts).
