=head1 DESCRIPTION

The contents of a document.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Blob => Str

The contents of the document. Documents passed to the C<blob> parameter
must be base64 encoded. Your code might not need to encode the document
file bytes if you're using an Amazon Web Services SDK to call Amazon Q
Business APIs. If you are calling the Amazon Q Business endpoint
directly using REST, you must base64 encode the contents before
sending.


=head2 S3 => L<Paws::QBusiness::S3>

The path to the document in an Amazon S3 bucket.



=head1 SEE ALSO
