=head1 NAME

Paws::QBusiness::DataSourceSyncJob

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QBusiness::DataSourceSyncJob object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataSourceErrorCode => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QBusiness::DataSourceSyncJob object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataSourceErrorCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about an Amazon Q Business data source connector
synchronization job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataSourceErrorCode => Str

If the reason that the synchronization failed is due to an error with
the underlying data source, this field contains a code that identifies
the error.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The Unix timestamp when the synchronization job completed.


=head2 Error => L<Paws::QBusiness::ErrorDetail>

If the C<Status> field is set to C<FAILED>, the C<ErrorCode> field
indicates the reason the synchronization failed.


=head2 ExecutionId => Str

The identifier of a data source synchronization job.


=head2 Metrics => L<Paws::QBusiness::DataSourceSyncJobMetrics>

Maps a batch delete document request to a specific data source sync
job. This is optional and should only be supplied when documents are
deleted by a data source connector.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The Unix time stamp when the data source synchronization job started.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the synchronization job. When the C<Status> field is set
to C<SUCCEEDED>, the synchronization job is done. If the status code is
C<FAILED>, the C<ErrorCode> and C<ErrorMessage> fields give you the
reason for the failure.
