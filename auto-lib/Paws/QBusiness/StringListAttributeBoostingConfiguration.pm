=head1 NAME

Paws::QBusiness::StringListAttributeBoostingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QBusiness::StringListAttributeBoostingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BoostingLevel => $value, ..., BoostingLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QBusiness::StringListAttributeBoostingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BoostingLevel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information on boosting C<STRING_LIST> type document
attributes.

For C<STRING> and C<STRING_LIST> type document attributes to be used
for boosting on the console and the API, they must be enabled for
search using the DocumentAttributeConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeConfiguration.html)
object of the UpdateIndex
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_UpdateIndex.html)
API. If you haven't enabled searching on these attributes, you can't
boost attributes of these data types on either the console or the API.

For more information on how boosting document attributes work in Amazon
Q Business, see Boosting using document attributes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/business-use-dg/metadata-boosting.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
