=head1 NAME

Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeValueOperator => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeValueOperator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The target document attribute or metadata field you want to alter when
ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business.

For example, you can delete all customer identification numbers
associated with the documents, stored in the document metadata field
called 'Customer_ID' by setting the target key as 'Customer_ID' and the
deletion flag to C<TRUE>. This removes all customer ID values in the
field 'Customer_ID'. This would scrub personally identifiable
information from each document's metadata.

Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if it has not already
been created as an index field. After you create your index field, you
can create a document metadata field using C<DocumentAttributeTarget>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html).
Amazon Q Business will then map your newly created document attribute
to your index field.

You can also use this with C<DocumentAttributeCondition>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeCondition.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttributeValueOperator => Str

C<TRUE> to delete the existing target value for your specified target
attribute key. You cannot create a target value and set this to
C<TRUE>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The identifier of the target document attribute or metadata field. For
example, 'Department' could be an identifier for the target attribute
or metadata field that includes the department names associated with
the documents.


=head2 Value => L<Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeValue>
