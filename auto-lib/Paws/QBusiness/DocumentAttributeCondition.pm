=head1 NAME

Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The condition used for the target document attribute or metadata field
when ingesting documents into Amazon Q Business. You use this with
C<DocumentAttributeTarget>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/api-reference/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html)
to apply the condition.

For example, you can create the 'Department' target field and have it
prefill department names associated with the documents based on
information in the 'Source_URI' field. Set the condition that if the
'Source_URI' field contains 'financial' in its URI value, then prefill
the target field 'Department' with the target value 'Finance' for the
document.

Amazon Q Business can't create a target field if it has not already
been created as an index field. After you create your index field, you
can create a document metadata field using C<DocumentAttributeTarget>.
Amazon Q Business then will map your newly created metadata field to
your index field.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The identifier of the document attribute used for the condition.

For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the attribute or
metadata field that contains source URIs associated with the documents.

Amazon Q Business currently doesn't support C<_document_body> as an
attribute key used for the condition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

The identifier of the document attribute used for the condition.

For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the attribute or
metadata field that contains source URIs associated with the documents.

Amazon Q Business currently does not support C<_document_body> as an
attribute key used for the condition.


=head2 Value => L<Paws::QBusiness::DocumentAttributeValue>
