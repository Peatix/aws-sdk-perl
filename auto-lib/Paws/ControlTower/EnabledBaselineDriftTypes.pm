=head1 NAME

Paws::ControlTower::EnabledBaselineDriftTypes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ControlTower::EnabledBaselineDriftTypes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inheritance => $value, ..., Inheritance => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ControlTower::EnabledBaselineDriftTypes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inheritance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The types of drift that can be detected for an enabled baseline.

=over

=item *

Amazon Web Services Control Tower detects inheritance drift on the
enabled baselines that target OUs: C<AWSControlTowerBaseline> and
C<BackupBaseline>.

=item *

Amazon Web Services Control Tower does not detect drift on the
baselines that apply to your landing zone: C<IdentityCenterBaseline>,
C<AuditBaseline>, C<LogArchiveBaseline>, C<BackupCentralVaultBaseline>,
or C<BackupAdminBaseline>. For more information, see Types of baselines
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/types-of-baselines.html).

=back

Baselines enabled on an OU are inherited by its member accounts as
child C<EnabledBaseline> resources. The baseline on the OU serves as
the parent C<EnabledBaseline>, which governs the configuration of each
child C<EnabledBaseline>.

If the baseline configuration of a member account in an OU does not
match the configuration of the parent OU, the parent and child baseline
is in a state of inheritance drift. This drift could occur in the
C<AWSControlTowerBaseline> or the C<BackupBaseline> related to that
account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Inheritance => L<Paws::ControlTower::EnabledBaselineInheritanceDrift>

At least one account within the target OU does not match the baseline
configuration defined on that OU. An account is in inheritance drift
when it does not match the configuration of a parent OU, possibly a new
parent OU, if the account is moved.
