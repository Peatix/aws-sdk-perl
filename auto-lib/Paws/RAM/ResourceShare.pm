=head1 NAME

Paws::RAM::ResourceShare

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RAM::ResourceShare object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowExternalPrincipals => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RAM::ResourceShare object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowExternalPrincipals

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a resource share in RAM.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowExternalPrincipals => Bool

Indicates whether principals outside your organization in Organizations
can be associated with a resource share.

=over

=item *

C<True> E<ndash> the resource share can be shared with any Amazon Web
Services account.

=item *

C<False> E<ndash> the resource share can be shared with only accounts
in the same organization as the account that owns the resource share.

=back



=head2 CreationTime => Str

The date and time when the resource share was created.


=head2 FeatureSet => Str

Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This
parameter can have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

B<STANDARD> E<ndash> A resource share that supports all functionality.
These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the
resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using
the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by
RAM, or it might have been B<CREATED_FROM_POLICY> and then promoted.

=item *

B<CREATED_FROM_POLICY> E<ndash> The customer manually shared a resource
by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any
existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed
permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached
policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the
Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM
unless you promote it. For more information, see
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.

=item *

B<PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD> E<ndash> This resource share was originally
C<CREATED_FROM_POLICY>, but the customer ran the
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
progress. This value changes to C<STANDARD> when complete.

=back



=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The date and time when the resource share was last updated.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the resource share.


=head2 OwningAccountId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource share.


=head2 ResourceShareArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
of the resource share


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the resource share.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A message about the status of the resource share.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RAM::Tag>]
