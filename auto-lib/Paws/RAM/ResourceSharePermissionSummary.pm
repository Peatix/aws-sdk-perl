=head1 NAME

Paws::RAM::ResourceSharePermissionSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RAM::ResourceSharePermissionSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RAM::ResourceSharePermissionSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an RAM permission.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
of the permission you want information about.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The date and time when the permission was created.


=head2 DefaultVersion => Bool

Specifies whether the version of the managed permission used by this
resource share is the default version for this managed permission.


=head2 FeatureSet => Str

Indicates what features are available for this resource share. This
parameter can have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

B<STANDARD> E<ndash> A resource share that supports all functionality.
These resource shares are visible to all principals you share the
resource share with. You can modify these resource shares in RAM using
the console or APIs. This resource share might have been created by
RAM, or it might have been B<CREATED_FROM_POLICY> and then promoted.

=item *

B<CREATED_FROM_POLICY> E<ndash> The customer manually shared a resource
by attaching a resource-based policy. That policy did not match any
existing managed permissions, so RAM created this customer managed
permission automatically on the customer's behalf based on the attached
policy document. This type of resource share is visible only to the
Amazon Web Services account that created it. You can't modify it in RAM
unless you promote it. For more information, see
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy.

=item *

B<PROMOTING_TO_STANDARD> E<ndash> This resource share was originally
C<CREATED_FROM_POLICY>, but the customer ran the
PromoteResourceShareCreatedFromPolicy and that operation is still in
progress. This value changes to C<STANDARD> when complete.

=back



=head2 IsResourceTypeDefault => Bool

Specifies whether the managed permission associated with this resource
share is the default managed permission for all resources of this
resource type.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The date and time when the permission was last updated.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of this managed permission.


=head2 PermissionType => Str

The type of managed permission. This can be one of the following
values:

=over

=item *

C<AWS_MANAGED> E<ndash> Amazon Web Services created and manages this
managed permission. You can associate it with your resource shares, but
you can't modify it.

=item *

C<CUSTOMER_MANAGED> E<ndash> You, or another principal in your account
created this managed permission. You can associate it with your
resource shares and create new versions that have different
permissions.

=back



=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of resource to which this permission applies. This takes the
form of: C<service-code>:C<resource-code>, and is case-insensitive. For
example, an Amazon EC2 Subnet would be represented by the string
C<ec2:subnet>.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the permission.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RAM::Tag>]

A list of the tag key value pairs currently attached to the permission.


=head2 Version => Str

The version of the permission associated with this resource share.
