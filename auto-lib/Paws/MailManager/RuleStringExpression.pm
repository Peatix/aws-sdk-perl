=head1 NAME

Paws::MailManager::RuleStringExpression

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MailManager::RuleStringExpression object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Evaluate => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MailManager::RuleStringExpression object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Evaluate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A string expression is evaluated against strings or substrings of the
email.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Evaluate => L<Paws::MailManager::RuleStringToEvaluate>

The string to evaluate in a string condition expression.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

The matching operator for a string condition expression.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The string(s) to be evaluated in a string condition expression. For all
operators, except for NOT_EQUALS, if multiple values are given, the
values are processed as an OR. That is, if any of the values match the
email's string using the given operator, the condition is deemed to
match. However, for NOT_EQUALS, the condition is only deemed to match
if none of the given strings match the email's string.
