=head1 NAME

Paws::MailManager::RuleIpExpression

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MailManager::RuleIpExpression object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Evaluate => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MailManager::RuleIpExpression object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Evaluate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An IP address expression matching certain IP addresses within a given
range of IP addresses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Evaluate => L<Paws::MailManager::RuleIpToEvaluate>

The IP address to evaluate in this condition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

The operator to evaluate the IP address.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IP CIDR blocks in format "x.y.z.w/n" (eg 10.0.0.0/8) to match with
the email's IP address. For the operator CIDR_MATCHES, if multiple
values are given, they are evaluated as an OR. That is, if the IP
address is contained within any of the given CIDR ranges, the condition
is deemed to match. For NOT_CIDR_MATCHES, if multiple CIDR ranges are
given, the condition is deemed to match if the IP address is not
contained in any of the given CIDR ranges.



=head1 SEE ALSO
