=head1 NAME

Paws::MailManager::Rule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MailManager::Rule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actions => $value, ..., Unless => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MailManager::Rule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule contains conditions, "unless conditions" and actions. For each
envelope recipient of an email, if all conditions match and none of the
"unless conditions" match, then all of the actions are executed
sequentially. If no conditions are provided, the rule always applies
and the actions are implicitly executed. If only "unless conditions"
are provided, the rule applies if the email does not match the
evaluation of the "unless conditions".

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Actions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MailManager::RuleAction>]

The list of actions to execute when the conditions match the incoming
email, and none of the "unless conditions" match.


=head2 Conditions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MailManager::RuleCondition>]

The conditions of this rule. All conditions must match the email for
the actions to be executed. An empty list of conditions means that all
emails match, but are still subject to any "unless conditions"


=head2 Name => Str

The user-friendly name of the rule.


=head2 Unless => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MailManager::RuleCondition>]

The "unless conditions" of this rule. None of the conditions can match
the email for the actions to be executed. If any of these conditions do
match the email, then the actions are not executed.
