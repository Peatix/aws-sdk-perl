=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::AttendeeCapabilities

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::AttendeeCapabilities object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Audio => $value, ..., Video => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::AttendeeCapabilities object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Audio

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The media capabilities of an attendee: audio, video, or content.

You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the
capabilities can do, such as C<SendReceive> data. For more information,
refer to and .

When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

=over

=item *

If you specify C<MeetingFeatures:Video:MaxResolution:None> when you
create a meeting, all API requests that include C<SendReceive>,
C<Send>, or C<Receive> for C<AttendeeCapabilities:Video> will be
rejected with C<ValidationError 400>.

=item *

If you specify C<MeetingFeatures:Content:MaxResolution:None> when you
create a meeting, all API requests that include C<SendReceive>,
C<Send>, or C<Receive> for C<AttendeeCapabilities:Content> will be
rejected with C<ValidationError 400>.

=item *

You can't set C<content> capabilities to C<SendReceive> or C<Receive>
unless you also set C<video> capabilities to C<SendReceive> or
C<Receive>. If you don't set the C<video> capability to receive, the
response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you
can set your C<video> capability to receive and you set your C<content>
capability to not receive.

=item *

When you change an C<audio> capability from C<None> or C<Receive> to
C<Send> or C<SendReceive> , and an attendee unmutes their microphone,
audio flows from the attendee to the other meeting participants.

=item *

When you change a C<video> or C<content> capability from C<None> or
C<Receive> to C<Send> or C<SendReceive> , and the attendee turns on
their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those
streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the
Amazon Chime back-end server.
