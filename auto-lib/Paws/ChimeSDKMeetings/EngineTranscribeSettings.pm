=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::EngineTranscribeSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::EngineTranscribeSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContentIdentificationType => $value, ..., VocabularyNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::EngineTranscribeSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContentIdentificationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings specific for Amazon Transcribe as the live transcription
engine.

If you specify an invalid combination of parameters, a
C<TranscriptFailed> event will be sent with the contents of the
C<BadRequestException> generated by Amazon Transcribe. For more
information on each parameter and which combinations are valid, refer
to the StartStreamTranscription
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/API_streaming_StartStreamTranscription.html)
API in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContentIdentificationType => Str

Labels all personally identifiable information (PII) identified in your
transcript. If you don't include C<PiiEntityTypes>, all PII is
identified.

You canE<rsquo>t set C<ContentIdentificationType> and
C<ContentRedactionType>.


=head2 ContentRedactionType => Str

Content redaction is performed at the segment level. If you don't
include C<PiiEntityTypes>, all PII is redacted.

You canE<rsquo>t set C<ContentRedactionType> and
C<ContentIdentificationType>.


=head2 EnablePartialResultsStabilization => Bool

Enables partial result stabilization for your transcription. Partial
result stabilization can reduce latency in your output, but may impact
accuracy.


=head2 IdentifyLanguage => Bool

Enables automatic language identification for your transcription.

If you include C<IdentifyLanguage>, you can optionally use
C<LanguageOptions> to include a list of language codes that you think
may be present in your audio stream. Including language options can
improve transcription accuracy.

You can also use C<PreferredLanguage> to include a preferred language.
Doing so can help Amazon Transcribe identify the language faster.

You must include either C<LanguageCode> or C<IdentifyLanguage>.

Language identification can't be combined with custom language models
or redaction.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

Specify the language code that represents the language spoken.

If you're unsure of the language spoken in your audio, consider using
C<IdentifyLanguage> to enable automatic language identification.


=head2 LanguageModelName => Str

Specify the name of the custom language model that you want to use when
processing your transcription. Note that language model names are case
sensitive.

The language of the specified language model must match the language
code. If the languages don't match, the custom language model isn't
applied. There are no errors or warnings associated with a language
mismatch.

If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the custom language
model must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.


=head2 LanguageOptions => Str

Specify two or more language codes that represent the languages you
think may be present in your media; including more than five is not
recommended. If you're unsure what languages are present, do not
include this parameter.

Including language options can improve the accuracy of language
identification.

If you include C<LanguageOptions>, you must also include
C<IdentifyLanguage>.

You can only include one language dialect per language. For example,
you cannot include C<en-US> and C<en-AU>.


=head2 PartialResultsStability => Str

Specify the level of stability to use when you enable partial results
stabilization (C<EnablePartialResultsStabilization>).

Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High stability transcribes
faster, but with slightly lower accuracy.


=head2 PiiEntityTypes => Str

Specify which types of personally identifiable information (PII) you
want to redact in your transcript. You can include as many types as
you'd like, or you can select C<ALL>.

Values must be comma-separated and can include: C<ADDRESS>,
C<BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>, C<BANK_ROUTING>, C<CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV>,
C<CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY> C<CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER>, C<EMAIL>,C<NAME>,
C<PHONE>, C<PIN>, C<SSN>, or C<ALL>.

Note that if you include C<PiiEntityTypes>, you must also include
C<ContentIdentificationType> or C<ContentRedactionType>.

If you include C<ContentRedactionType> or C<ContentIdentificationType>,
but do not include PiiEntityTypes, all PII is redacted or identified.


=head2 PreferredLanguage => Str

Specify a preferred language from the subset of languages codes you
specified in C<LanguageOptions>.

You can only use this parameter if you include C<IdentifyLanguage> and
C<LanguageOptions>.


=head2 Region => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region in which to use Amazon Transcribe.

If you don't specify a Region, then the MediaRegion
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_CreateMeeting.html)
of the meeting is used. However, if Amazon Transcribe is not available
in the C<MediaRegion>, then a C<TranscriptFailed> event is sent.

Use C<auto> to use Amazon Transcribe in a Region near the
meetingE<rsquo>s C<MediaRegion>. For more information, refer to
Choosing a transcription Region
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/transcription-options.html#choose-region)
in the I<Amazon Chime SDK Developer Guide>.


=head2 VocabularyFilterMethod => Str

Specify how you want your vocabulary filter applied to your transcript.

To replace words with C<***>, choose C<mask>.

To delete words, choose C<remove>.

To flag words without changing them, choose C<tag>.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

Specify the name of the custom vocabulary filter that you want to use
when processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary filter names
are case sensitive.

If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabulary filter
must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

If you include C<IdentifyLanguage> and want to use one or more
vocabulary filters with your transcription, use the
C<VocabularyFilterNames> parameter instead.


=head2 VocabularyFilterNames => Str

Specify the names of the custom vocabulary filters that you want to use
when processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary filter names
are case sensitive.

If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabulary filter
must be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

If you're I<not> including C<IdentifyLanguage> and want to use a custom
vocabulary filter with your transcription, use the
C<VocabularyFilterName> parameter instead.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

Specify the name of the custom vocabulary that you want to use when
processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary names are case
sensitive.

If you use Amazon Transcribe multiple Regions, the vocabulary must be
available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

If you include C<IdentifyLanguage> and want to use one or more custom
vocabularies with your transcription, use the C<VocabularyNames>
parameter instead.


=head2 VocabularyNames => Str

Specify the names of the custom vocabularies that you want to use when
processing your transcription. Note that vocabulary names are case
sensitive.

If you use Amazon Transcribe in multiple Regions, the vocabulary must
be available in Amazon Transcribe in each Region.

If you don't include C<IdentifyLanguage> and want to use a custom
vocabulary with your transcription, use the C<VocabularyName> parameter
instead.
