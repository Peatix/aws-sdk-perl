=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::Attendee

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::Attendee object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttendeeId => $value, ..., JoinToken => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::Attendee object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttendeeId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a unique C<AttendeeId>
and C<JoinToken>. The C<JoinToken> allows a client to authenticate and
join as the specified attendee. The C<JoinToken> expires when the
meeting ends, or when DeleteAttendee is called. After that, the
attendee is unable to join the meeting.

We recommend securely transferring each C<JoinToken> from your server
application to the client so that no other client has access to the
token except for the one authorized to represent the attendee.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttendeeId => Str

The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.


=head2 Capabilities => L<Paws::ChimeSDKMeetings::AttendeeCapabilities>

The capabilities assigned to an attendee: audio, video, or content.

You use the capabilities with a set of values that control what the
capabilities can do, such as C<SendReceive> data. For more information
about those values, see .

When using capabilities, be aware of these corner cases:

=over

=item *

If you specify C<MeetingFeatures:Video:MaxResolution:None> when you
create a meeting, all API requests that include C<SendReceive>,
C<Send>, or C<Receive> for C<AttendeeCapabilities:Video> will be
rejected with C<ValidationError 400>.

=item *

If you specify C<MeetingFeatures:Content:MaxResolution:None> when you
create a meeting, all API requests that include C<SendReceive>,
C<Send>, or C<Receive> for C<AttendeeCapabilities:Content> will be
rejected with C<ValidationError 400>.

=item *

You can't set C<content> capabilities to C<SendReceive> or C<Receive>
unless you also set C<video> capabilities to C<SendReceive> or
C<Receive>. If you don't set the C<video> capability to receive, the
response will contain an HTTP 400 Bad Request status code. However, you
can set your C<video> capability to receive and you set your C<content>
capability to not receive.

=item *

When you change an C<audio> capability from C<None> or C<Receive> to
C<Send> or C<SendReceive> , and if the attendee left their microphone
unmuted, audio will flow from the attendee to the other meeting
participants.

=item *

When you change a C<video> or C<content> capability from C<None> or
C<Receive> to C<Send> or C<SendReceive> , and if the attendee turned on
their video or content streams, remote attendees can receive those
streams, but only after media renegotiation between the client and the
Amazon Chime back-end server.

=back



=head2 ExternalUserId => Str

The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token. Links the
attendee to an identity managed by a builder application.

Pattern:
C<[-_&@+=,(){}\[\]\/E<lchevron>E<rchevron>.:|'"#a-zA-Z0-9E<Agrave>-E<yuml>\s]*>

Values that begin with C<aws:> are reserved. You can't configure a
value that uses this prefix. Case insensitive.


=head2 JoinToken => Str

The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.
