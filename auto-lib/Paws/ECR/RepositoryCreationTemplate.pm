=head1 NAME

Paws::ECR::RepositoryCreationTemplate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECR::RepositoryCreationTemplate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppliedFor => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECR::RepositoryCreationTemplate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppliedFor

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the repository creation template associated with the
request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AppliedFor => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of enumerable Strings representing the repository creation
scenarios that this template will apply towards. The two supported
scenarios are PULL_THROUGH_CACHE and REPLICATION


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repository
creation template was created.


=head2 CustomRoleArn => Str

The ARN of the role to be assumed by Amazon ECR. Amazon ECR will assume
your supplied role when the customRoleArn is specified. When this field
isn't specified, Amazon ECR will use the service-linked role for the
repository creation template.


=head2 Description => Str

The description associated with the repository creation template.


=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::ECR::EncryptionConfigurationForRepositoryCreationTemplate>

The encryption configuration associated with the repository creation
template.


=head2 ImageTagMutability => Str

The tag mutability setting for the repository. If this parameter is
omitted, the default setting of MUTABLE will be used which will allow
image tags to be overwritten. If IMMUTABLE is specified, all image tags
within the repository will be immutable which will prevent them from
being overwritten.


=head2 LifecyclePolicy => Str

The lifecycle policy to use for repositories created using the
template.


=head2 Prefix => Str

The repository namespace prefix associated with the repository creation
template.


=head2 RepositoryPolicy => Str

The repository policy to apply to repositories created using the
template. A repository policy is a permissions policy associated with a
repository to control access permissions.


=head2 ResourceTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECR::Tag>]

The metadata to apply to the repository to help you categorize and
organize. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
which you define. Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128
characters, and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The date and time, in JavaScript date format, when the repository
creation template was last updated.
