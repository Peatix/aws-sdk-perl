=head1 NAME

Paws::ECR::EncryptionConfigurationForRepositoryCreationTemplate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECR::EncryptionConfigurationForRepositoryCreationTemplate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptionType => $value, ..., KmsKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECR::EncryptionConfigurationForRepositoryCreationTemplate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The encryption configuration to associate with the repository creation
template.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncryptionType => Str

The encryption type to use.

If you use the C<KMS> encryption type, the contents of the repository
will be encrypted using server-side encryption with Key Management
Service key stored in KMS. When you use KMS to encrypt your data, you
can either use the default Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for
Amazon ECR, or specify your own KMS key, which you already created. For
more information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with
an KMS key stored in Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide>.

If you use the C<AES256> encryption type, Amazon ECR uses server-side
encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys which encrypts the
images in the repository using an AES256 encryption algorithm. For more
information, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with
Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service Console Developer Guide>.


=head2 KmsKey => Str

If you use the C<KMS> encryption type, specify the KMS key to use for
encryption. The full ARN of the KMS key must be specified. The key must
exist in the same Region as the repository. If no key is specified, the
default Amazon Web Services managed KMS key for Amazon ECR will be
used.
