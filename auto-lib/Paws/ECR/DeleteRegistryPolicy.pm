This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteRegistryPolicy on the

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.ecr = Paws->service('ECR');
    my $DeleteRegistryPolicyResponse = $api . ecr->DeleteRegistryPolicy();

    # Results:
    my $PolicyText = $DeleteRegistryPolicyResponse->PolicyText;
    my $RegistryId = $DeleteRegistryPolicyResponse->RegistryId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECR::DeleteRegistryPolicyResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
