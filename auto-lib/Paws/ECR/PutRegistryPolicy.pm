=head1 NAME

Paws::ECR::PutRegistryPolicy - Arguments for method PutRegistryPolicy on L<Paws::ECR>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutRegistryPolicy on the
L<Amazon Elastic Container Registry|Paws::ECR> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutRegistryPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutRegistryPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.ecr = Paws->service('ECR');
    my $PutRegistryPolicyResponse = $api . ecr->PutRegistryPolicy(
      PolicyText => 'MyRegistryPolicyText',

    );

    # Results:
    my $PolicyText = $PutRegistryPolicyResponse->PolicyText;
    my $RegistryId = $PutRegistryPolicyResponse->RegistryId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECR::PutRegistryPolicyResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
