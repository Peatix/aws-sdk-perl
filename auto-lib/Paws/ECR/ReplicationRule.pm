=head1 NAME

Paws::ECR::ReplicationRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECR::ReplicationRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destinations => $value, ..., RepositoryFilters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECR::ReplicationRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destinations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An array of objects representing the replication destinations and
repository filters for a replication configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECR::ReplicationDestination>]

An array of objects representing the destination for a replication
rule.


=head2 RepositoryFilters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECR::RepositoryFilter>]

An array of objects representing the filters for a replication rule.
Specifying a repository filter for a replication rule provides a method
for controlling which repositories in a private registry are
replicated.
