=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeProcessorConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeProcessorConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContentIdentificationType => $value, ..., VocabularyNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeProcessorConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContentIdentificationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the configuration settings for an Amazon
Transcribe processor.

Calls to this API must include a C<LanguageCode>, C<IdentifyLanguage>,
or C<IdentifyMultipleLanguages> parameter. If you include more than one
of those parameters, your transcription job fails.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContentIdentificationType => Str

Labels all personally identifiable information (PII) identified in your
transcript.

Content identification is performed at the segment level; PII specified
in C<PiiEntityTypes> is flagged upon complete transcription of an audio
segment.

You canE<rsquo>t set C<ContentIdentificationType> and
C<ContentRedactionType> in the same request. If you set both, your
request returns a C<BadRequestException>.

For more information, see Redacting or identifying personally
identifiable information
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/pii-redaction.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 ContentRedactionType => Str

Redacts all personally identifiable information (PII) identified in
your transcript.

Content redaction is performed at the segment level; PII specified in
PiiEntityTypes is redacted upon complete transcription of an audio
segment.

You canE<rsquo>t set ContentRedactionType and ContentIdentificationType
in the same request. If you set both, your request returns a
C<BadRequestException>.

For more information, see Redacting or identifying personally
identifiable information
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/pii-redaction.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 EnablePartialResultsStabilization => Bool

Enables partial result stabilization for your transcription. Partial
result stabilization can reduce latency in your output, but may impact
accuracy.

For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/streaming.html#streaming-partial-result-stabilization)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 FilterPartialResults => Bool

If true, C<TranscriptEvents> with C<IsPartial: true> are filtered out
of the insights target.


=head2 IdentifyLanguage => Bool

Turns language identification on or off.


=head2 IdentifyMultipleLanguages => Bool

Turns language identification on or off for multiple languages.

Calls to this API must include a C<LanguageCode>, C<IdentifyLanguage>,
or C<IdentifyMultipleLanguages> parameter. If you include more than one
of those parameters, your transcription job fails.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code that represents the language spoken in your audio.

If you're unsure of the language spoken in your audio, consider using
C<IdentifyLanguage> to enable automatic language identification.

For a list of languages that real-time Call Analytics supports, see the
Supported languages table
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 LanguageModelName => Str

The name of the custom language model that you want to use when
processing your transcription. Note that language model names are case
sensitive.

The language of the specified language model must match the language
code you specify in your transcription request. If the languages don't
match, the custom language model isn't applied. There are no errors or
warnings associated with a language mismatch.

For more information, see Custom language models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-language-models.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 LanguageOptions => Str

The language options for the transcription, such as automatic language
detection.


=head2 PartialResultsStability => Str

The level of stability to use when you enable partial results
stabilization (C<EnablePartialResultsStabilization>).

Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High stability transcribes
faster, but with slightly lower accuracy.

For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/streaming.html#streaming-partial-result-stabilization)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 PiiEntityTypes => Str

The types of personally identifiable information (PII) to redact from a
transcript. You can include as many types as you'd like, or you can
select C<ALL>.

To include C<PiiEntityTypes> in your Call Analytics request, you must
also include C<ContentIdentificationType> or C<ContentRedactionType>,
but you can't include both.

Values must be comma-separated and can include: C<ADDRESS>,
C<BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>, C<BANK_ROUTING>, C<CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV>,
C<CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY>, C<CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER>, C<EMAIL>, C<NAME>,
C<PHONE>, C<PIN>, C<SSN>, or C<ALL>.

If you leave this parameter empty, the default behavior is equivalent
to C<ALL>.


=head2 PreferredLanguage => Str

The preferred language for the transcription.


=head2 ShowSpeakerLabel => Bool

Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcription
output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from individual speakers
in your media file.

For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html) in
the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 VocabularyFilterMethod => Str

The vocabulary filtering method used in your Call Analytics
transcription.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary filter that you specified in your
Call Analytics request.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 200.


=head2 VocabularyFilterNames => Str

The names of the custom vocabulary filter or filters using during
transcription.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary that you specified in your Call
Analytics request.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 200.


=head2 VocabularyNames => Str

The names of the custom vocabulary or vocabularies used during
transcription.
