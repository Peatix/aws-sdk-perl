=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::MediaCapturePipeline

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::MediaCapturePipeline object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChimeSdkMeetingConfiguration => $value, ..., UpdatedTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::MediaCapturePipeline object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChimeSdkMeetingConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A media pipeline object consisting of an ID, source type, source ARN, a
sink type, a sink ARN, and a configuration object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChimeSdkMeetingConfiguration => L<Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::ChimeSdkMeetingConfiguration>

The configuration for a specified media pipeline. C<SourceType> must be
C<ChimeSdkMeeting>.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The time at which the pipeline was created, in ISO 8601 format.


=head2 MediaPipelineArn => Str

The ARN of the media capture pipeline


=head2 MediaPipelineId => Str

The ID of a media pipeline.


=head2 SinkArn => Str

ARN of the destination to which the media artifacts are saved.


=head2 SinkIamRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the sink role to be used with
C<AwsKmsKeyId> in C<SseAwsKeyManagementParams>.


=head2 SinkType => Str

Destination type to which the media artifacts are saved. You must use
an S3 Bucket.


=head2 SourceArn => Str

ARN of the source from which the media artifacts are saved.


=head2 SourceType => Str

Source type from which media artifacts are saved. You must use
C<ChimeMeeting>.


=head2 SseAwsKeyManagementParams => L<Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::SseAwsKeyManagementParams>

An object that contains server side encryption parameters to be used by
media capture pipeline. The parameters can also be used by media
concatenation pipeline taking media capture pipeline as a media source.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the media pipeline.


=head2 UpdatedTimestamp => Str

The time at which the pipeline was updated, in ISO 8601 format.
