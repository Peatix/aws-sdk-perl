=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamSourceRuntimeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamSourceRuntimeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MediaEncoding => $value, ..., Streams => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamSourceRuntimeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MediaEncoding

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The runtime configuration settings for the Kinesis video stream source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MediaEncoding => Str

Specifies the encoding of your input audio. Supported format: PCM (only
signed 16-bit little-endian audio formats, which does not include WAV)

For more information, see Media formats
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-input.html#how-input-audio)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MediaSampleRate => Int

The sample rate of the input audio (in hertz). Low-quality audio, such
as telephone audio, is typically around 8,000 Hz. High-quality audio
typically ranges from 16,000 Hz to 48,000 Hz. Note that the sample rate
you specify must match that of your audio.

Valid Range: Minimum value of 8000. Maximum value of 48000.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Streams => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::StreamConfiguration>]

The streams in the source runtime configuration of a Kinesis video
stream.
