=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::FragmentSelector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::FragmentSelector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FragmentSelectorType => $value, ..., TimestampRange => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::FragmentSelector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FragmentSelectorType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the timestamp range and timestamp origin of a range of
fragments.

Only fragments with a start timestamp greater than or equal to the
given start time and less than or equal to the end time are returned.
For example, say a stream contains fragments with the following start
timestamps:

=over

=item *

00:00:00

=item *

00:00:02

=item *

00:00:04

=item *

00:00:06

=back

A fragment selector range with a start time of 00:00:01 and end time of
00:00:04 would return the fragments with start times of 00:00:02 and
00:00:04.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FragmentSelectorType => Str
