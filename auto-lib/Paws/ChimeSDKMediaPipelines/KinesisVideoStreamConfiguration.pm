=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataRetentionInHours => $value, ..., Region => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::KinesisVideoStreamConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataRetentionInHours

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of an Kinesis video stream.

If a meeting uses an opt-in Region as its MediaRegion
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_CreateMeeting.html#chimesdk-meeting-chime_CreateMeeting-request-MediaRegion),
the KVS stream must be in that same Region. For example, if a meeting
uses the C<af-south-1> Region, the KVS stream must also be in
C<af-south-1>. However, if the meeting uses a Region that AWS turns on
by default, the KVS stream can be in any available Region, including an
opt-in Region. For example, if the meeting uses C<ca-central-1>, the
KVS stream can be in C<eu-west-2>, C<us-east-1>, C<af-south-1>, or any
other Region that the Amazon Chime SDK supports.

To learn which AWS Region a meeting uses, call the GetMeeting
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_GetMeeting.html)
API and use the MediaRegion
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/APIReference/API_meeting-chime_CreateMeeting.html#chimesdk-meeting-chime_CreateMeeting-request-MediaRegion)
parameter from the response.

For more information about opt-in Regions, refer to Available Regions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/sdk-available-regions.html)
in the I<Amazon Chime SDK Developer Guide>, and Specify which AWS
Regions your account can use
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-regions.html#rande-manage-enable.html),
in the I<AWS Account Management Reference Guide>.
