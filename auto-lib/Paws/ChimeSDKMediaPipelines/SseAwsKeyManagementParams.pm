=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::SseAwsKeyManagementParams

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::SseAwsKeyManagementParams object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwsKmsEncryptionContext => $value, ..., AwsKmsKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::SseAwsKeyManagementParams object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwsKmsEncryptionContext

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains server side encryption parameters to be used by media capture
pipeline. The parameters can also be used by media concatenation
pipeline taking media capture pipeline as a media source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AwsKmsEncryptionContext => Str

Base64-encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the
encryption context as non-secret key-value pair known as encryption
context pairs, that provides an added layer of security for your data.
For more information, see KMS encryption context
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encrypt_context.html)
and Asymmetric keys in KMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AwsKmsKeyId => Str

The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your media pipeline output.
Decryption is required for concatenation pipeline. If using a key
located in the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify
your KMS key in one of four ways:

=over

=item *

Use the KMS key ID itself. For example,
C<1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.

=item *

Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, C<alias/ExampleAlias>.

=item *

Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example,
C<arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.

=item *

Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
C<arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias>.

=back

If using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than
the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your KMS key
in one of two ways:

=over

=item *

Use the ARN for the KMS key ID. For example,
C<arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.

=item *

Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example,
C<arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias>.

=back

If you don't specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with
the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3).

Note that the role specified in the C<SinkIamRoleArn> request parameter
must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
