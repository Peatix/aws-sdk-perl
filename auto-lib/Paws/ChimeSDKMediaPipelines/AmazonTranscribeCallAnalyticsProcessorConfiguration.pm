=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeCallAnalyticsProcessorConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeCallAnalyticsProcessorConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CallAnalyticsStreamCategories => $value, ..., VocabularyName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::AmazonTranscribeCallAnalyticsProcessorConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CallAnalyticsStreamCategories

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the configuration settings for an Amazon
Transcribe call analytics processor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CallAnalyticsStreamCategories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

By default, all C<CategoryEvents> are sent to the insights target. If
this parameter is specified, only included categories are sent to the
insights target.


=head2 ContentIdentificationType => Str

Labels all personally identifiable information (PII) identified in your
transcript.

Content identification is performed at the segment level; PII specified
in C<PiiEntityTypes> is flagged upon complete transcription of an audio
segment.

You canE<rsquo>t set C<ContentIdentificationType> and
C<ContentRedactionType> in the same request. If you do, your request
returns a C<BadRequestException>.

For more information, see Redacting or identifying personally
identifiable information
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/pii-redaction.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 ContentRedactionType => Str

Redacts all personally identifiable information (PII) identified in
your transcript.

Content redaction is performed at the segment level; PII specified in
C<PiiEntityTypes> is redacted upon complete transcription of an audio
segment.

You canE<rsquo>t set C<ContentRedactionType> and
C<ContentIdentificationType> in the same request. If you do, your
request returns a C<BadRequestException>.

For more information, see Redacting or identifying personally
identifiable information
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/pii-redaction.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 EnablePartialResultsStabilization => Bool

Enables partial result stabilization for your transcription. Partial
result stabilization can reduce latency in your output, but may impact
accuracy. For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/streaming.html#streaming-partial-result-stabilization)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 FilterPartialResults => Bool

If true, C<UtteranceEvents> with C<IsPartial: true> are filtered out of
the insights target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LanguageCode => Str

The language code in the configuration.


=head2 LanguageModelName => Str

Specifies the name of the custom language model to use when processing
a transcription. Note that language model names are case sensitive.

The language of the specified language model must match the language
code specified in the transcription request. If the languages don't
match, the custom language model isn't applied. Language mismatches
don't generate errors or warnings.

For more information, see Custom language models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-language-models.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 PartialResultsStability => Str

Specifies the level of stability to use when you enable partial results
stabilization (C<EnablePartialResultsStabilization>).

Low stability provides the highest accuracy. High stability transcribes
faster, but with slightly lower accuracy.

For more information, see Partial-result stabilization
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/streaming.html#streaming-partial-result-stabilization)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.


=head2 PiiEntityTypes => Str

Specifies the types of personally identifiable information (PII) to
redact from a transcript. You can include as many types as you'd like,
or you can select C<ALL>.

To include C<PiiEntityTypes> in your Call Analytics request, you must
also include C<ContentIdentificationType> or C<ContentRedactionType>,
but you can't include both.

Values must be comma-separated and can include: C<ADDRESS>,
C<BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER>, C<BANK_ROUTING>, C<CREDIT_DEBIT_CVV>,
C<CREDIT_DEBIT_EXPIRY>, C<CREDIT_DEBIT_NUMBER>, C<EMAIL>, C<NAME>,
C<PHONE>, C<PIN>, C<SSN>, or C<ALL>.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 300.


=head2 PostCallAnalyticsSettings => L<Paws::ChimeSDKMediaPipelines::PostCallAnalyticsSettings>

The settings for a post-call analysis task in an analytics
configuration.


=head2 VocabularyFilterMethod => Str

Specifies how to apply a vocabulary filter to a transcript.

To replace words with B<***>, choose C<mask>.

To delete words, choose C<remove>.

To flag words without changing them, choose C<tag>.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

Specifies the name of the custom vocabulary filter to use when
processing a transcription. Note that vocabulary filter names are case
sensitive.

If the language of the specified custom vocabulary filter doesn't match
the language identified in your media, the vocabulary filter is not
applied to your transcription.

For more information, see Using vocabulary filtering with unwanted
words
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/vocabulary-filtering.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 200.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

Specifies the name of the custom vocabulary to use when processing a
transcription. Note that vocabulary names are case sensitive.

If the language of the specified custom vocabulary doesn't match the
language identified in your media, the custom vocabulary is not applied
to your transcription.

For more information, see Custom vocabularies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/custom-vocabulary.html)
in the I<Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide>.

Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 200.
