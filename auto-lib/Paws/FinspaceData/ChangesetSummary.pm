=head1 NAME

Paws::FinspaceData::ChangesetSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FinspaceData::ChangesetSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveFromTimestamp => $value, ..., UpdatesChangesetId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FinspaceData::ChangesetSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveFromTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Changeset is unit of data in a Dataset.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveFromTimestamp => Int

Beginning time from which the Changeset is active. The value is
determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 ActiveUntilTimestamp => Int

Time until which the Changeset is active. The value is determined as
epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for Monday, November
1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 ChangesetArn => Str

The ARN identifier of the Changeset.


=head2 ChangesetId => Str

The unique identifier for a Changeset.


=head2 ChangeType => Str

Type that indicates how a Changeset is applied to a Dataset.

=over

=item *

C<REPLACE> E<ndash> Changeset is considered as a replacement to all
prior loaded Changesets.

=item *

C<APPEND> E<ndash> Changeset is considered as an addition to the end of
all prior loaded Changesets.

=item *

C<MODIFY> E<ndash> Changeset is considered as a replacement to a
specific prior ingested Changeset.

=back



=head2 CreateTime => Int

The timestamp at which the Changeset was created in FinSpace. The value
is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 DatasetId => Str

The unique identifier for the FinSpace Dataset in which the Changeset
is created.


=head2 ErrorInfo => L<Paws::FinspaceData::ChangesetErrorInfo>

The structure with error messages.


=head2 FormatParams => L<Paws::FinspaceData::FormatParams>

Options that define the structure of the source file(s).


=head2 SourceParams => L<Paws::FinspaceData::SourceParams>

Options that define the location of the data being ingested.


=head2 Status => Str

Status of the Changeset ingestion.

=over

=item *

C<PENDING> E<ndash> Changeset is pending creation.

=item *

C<FAILED> E<ndash> Changeset creation has failed.

=item *

C<SUCCESS> E<ndash> Changeset creation has succeeded.

=item *

C<RUNNING> E<ndash> Changeset creation is running.

=item *

C<STOP_REQUESTED> E<ndash> User requested Changeset creation to stop.

=back



=head2 UpdatedByChangesetId => Str

The unique identifier of the updated Changeset.


=head2 UpdatesChangesetId => Str

The unique identifier of the Changeset that is updated.
