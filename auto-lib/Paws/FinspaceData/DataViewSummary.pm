=head1 NAME

Paws::FinspaceData::DataViewSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FinspaceData::DataViewSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AsOfTimestamp => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FinspaceData::DataViewSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AsOfTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Structure for the summary of a Dataview.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AsOfTimestamp => Int

Time range to use for the Dataview. The value is determined as epoch
time in milliseconds. For example, the value for Monday, November 1,
2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 AutoUpdate => Bool

The flag to indicate Dataview should be updated automatically.


=head2 CreateTime => Int

is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.

=head2 DestinationTypeProperties => L<Paws::FinspaceData::DataViewDestinationTypeParams>

Information about the Dataview destination.


=head2 ErrorInfo => L<Paws::FinspaceData::DataViewErrorInfo>

The structure with error messages.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Int

The last time that a Dataview was modified. The value is determined as
epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for Monday, November
1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.
