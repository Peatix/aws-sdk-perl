=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::OriginGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::OriginGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailoverCriteria => $value, ..., SelectionCriteria => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::OriginGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailoverCriteria

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin and a secondary
origin to failover to) and a failover criteria that you specify. You
create an origin group to support origin failover in CloudFront. When
you create or update a distribution, you can specify the origin group
instead of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover from the
primary origin to the secondary origin under the failover conditions
that you've chosen.

Optionally, you can choose selection criteria for your origin group to
specify how your origins are selected when your distribution routes
viewer requests.
