=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::VpcOriginConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OriginKeepaliveTimeout => $value, ..., VpcOriginId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::VpcOriginConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OriginKeepaliveTimeout

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Amazon CloudFront VPC origin configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OriginKeepaliveTimeout => Int

Specifies how long, in seconds, CloudFront persists its connection to
the origin. The minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60 seconds,
and the default (if you don't specify otherwise) is 5 seconds.

For more information, see Keep-alive timeout (custom origins only)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginKeepaliveTimeout)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.


=head2 OriginReadTimeout => Int

Specifies how long, in seconds, CloudFront waits for a response from
the origin. This is also known as the I<origin response timeout>. The
minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60 seconds, and the default
(if you don't specify otherwise) is 30 seconds.

For more information, see Response timeout (custom origins only)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesOriginResponseTimeout)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VpcOriginId => Str

The VPC origin ID.
