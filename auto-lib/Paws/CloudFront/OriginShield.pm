=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::OriginShield object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., OriginShieldRegion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::OriginShield object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CloudFront Origin Shield.

Using Origin Shield can help reduce the load on your origin. For more
information, see Using Origin Shield
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is enabled.

When it's enabled, CloudFront routes all requests through Origin
Shield, which can help protect your origin. When it's disabled,
CloudFront might send requests directly to your origin from multiple
edge locations or regional edge caches.


=head2 OriginShieldRegion => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region for Origin Shield.

Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that has the lowest latency to
your origin. To specify a region, use the region code, not the region
name. For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region as C<us-east-2>.

When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must specify the Amazon
Web Services Region for Origin Shield. For the list of Amazon Web
Services Regions that you can specify, and for help choosing the best
Region for your origin, see Choosing the Amazon Web Services Region for
Origin Shield
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/origin-shield.html#choose-origin-shield-region)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.
