=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., SigningProtocol => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CloudFront origin access control configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the origin access control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A name to identify the origin access control. You can specify up to 64
characters.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OriginAccessControlOriginType => Str

The type of origin that this origin access control is for.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SigningBehavior => Str

Specifies which requests CloudFront signs (adds authentication
information to). Specify C<always> for the most common use case. For
more information, see origin access control advanced settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html#oac-advanced-settings)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

This field can have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<always> E<ndash> CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwriting
the C<Authorization> header from the viewer request if one exists.

=item *

C<never> E<ndash> CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests. This
value turns off origin access control for all origins in all
distributions that use this origin access control.

=item *

C<no-override> E<ndash> If the viewer request doesn't contain the
C<Authorization> header, then CloudFront signs the origin request. If
the viewer request contains the C<Authorization> header, then
CloudFront doesn't sign the origin request and instead passes along the
C<Authorization> header from the viewer request. B<WARNING: To pass
along the C<Authorization> header from the viewer request, you I<must>
add the C<Authorization> header to a cache policy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/controlling-the-cache-key.html)
for all cache behaviors that use origins associated with this origin
access control.>

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SigningProtocol => Str

The signing protocol of the origin access control, which determines how
CloudFront signs (authenticates) requests. The only valid value is
C<sigv4>.
