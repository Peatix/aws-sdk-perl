=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyCorsConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyCorsConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessControlAllowCredentials => $value, ..., OriginOverride => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyCorsConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessControlAllowCredentials

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A configuration for a set of HTTP response headers that are used for
cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). CloudFront adds these headers to
HTTP responses that it sends for CORS requests that match a cache
behavior associated with this response headers policy.

For more information about CORS, see Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) in the
MDN Web Docs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessControlAllowCredentials => Bool

A Boolean that CloudFront uses as the value for the
C<Access-Control-Allow-Credentials> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Allow-Credentials> HTTP
response header, see Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Credentials)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessControlAllowHeaders => L<Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyAccessControlAllowHeaders>

A list of HTTP header names that CloudFront includes as values for the
C<Access-Control-Allow-Headers> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Allow-Headers> HTTP
response header, see Access-Control-Allow-Headers
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessControlAllowMethods => L<Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyAccessControlAllowMethods>

A list of HTTP methods that CloudFront includes as values for the
C<Access-Control-Allow-Methods> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Allow-Methods> HTTP
response header, see Access-Control-Allow-Methods
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Methods)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessControlAllowOrigins => L<Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyAccessControlAllowOrigins>

A list of origins (domain names) that CloudFront can use as the value
for the C<Access-Control-Allow-Origin> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Allow-Origin> HTTP
response header, see Access-Control-Allow-Origin
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 AccessControlExposeHeaders => L<Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyAccessControlExposeHeaders>

A list of HTTP headers that CloudFront includes as values for the
C<Access-Control-Expose-Headers> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Expose-Headers> HTTP
response header, see Access-Control-Expose-Headers
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Expose-Headers)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 AccessControlMaxAgeSec => Int

A number that CloudFront uses as the value for the
C<Access-Control-Max-Age> HTTP response header.

For more information about the C<Access-Control-Max-Age> HTTP response
header, see Access-Control-Max-Age
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Max-Age)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OriginOverride => Bool

A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront overrides HTTP response
headers received from the origin with the ones specified in this
response headers policy.
