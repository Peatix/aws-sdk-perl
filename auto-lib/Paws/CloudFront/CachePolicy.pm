=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CachePolicyConfig => $value, ..., LastModifiedTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CachePolicyConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A cache policy.

When it's attached to a cache behavior, the cache policy determines the
following:

=over

=item *

The values that CloudFront includes in the cache key. These values can
include HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings. CloudFront uses
the cache key to find an object in its cache that it can return to the
viewer.

=item *

The default, minimum, and maximum time to live (TTL) values that you
want objects to stay in the CloudFront cache.

=back

The headers, cookies, and query strings that are included in the cache
key are also included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
CloudFront sends a request when it can't find a valid object in its
cache that matches the request's cache key. If you want to send values
to the origin but I<not> include them in the cache key, use
C<OriginRequestPolicy>.
