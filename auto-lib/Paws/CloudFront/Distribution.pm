=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::Distribution

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::Distribution object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveTrustedKeyGroups => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::Distribution object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveTrustedKeyGroups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A distribution tells CloudFront where you want content to be delivered
from, and the details about how to track and manage content delivery.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveTrustedKeyGroups => L<Paws::CloudFront::ActiveTrustedKeyGroups>

This field contains a list of key groups and the public keys in each
key group that CloudFront can use to verify the signatures of signed
URLs or signed cookies.


=head2 ActiveTrustedSigners => L<Paws::CloudFront::ActiveTrustedSigners>

We recommend using C<TrustedKeyGroups> instead of C<TrustedSigners>.

This field contains a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs and the
active CloudFront key pairs in each account that CloudFront can use to
verify the signatures of signed URLs or signed cookies.


=head2 AliasICPRecordals => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFront::AliasICPRecordal>]

Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an
Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to serve content
publicly on an alternate domain name, also known as a CNAME, that
they've added to CloudFront. AliasICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal
status for CNAMEs associated with distributions.

For more information about ICP recordals, see Signup, Accounts, and
Credentials
(https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/aws/latest/userguide/accounts-and-credentials.html)
in I<Getting Started with Amazon Web Services services in China>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ARN => Str

The distribution's Amazon Resource Name (ARN).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DistributionConfig => L<Paws::CloudFront::DistributionConfig>

The distribution's configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainName => Str

The distribution's CloudFront domain name. For example:
C<d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The distribution's identifier. For example: C<E1U5RQF7T870K0>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InProgressInvalidationBatches => Int

The number of invalidation batches currently in progress.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time when the distribution was last modified.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The distribution's status. When the status is C<Deployed>, the
distribution's information is fully propagated to all CloudFront edge
locations.
