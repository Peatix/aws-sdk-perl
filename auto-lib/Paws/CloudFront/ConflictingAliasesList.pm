=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::ConflictingAliasesList

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::ConflictingAliasesList object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Items => $value, ..., Quantity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ConflictingAliasesList object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Items

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of aliases (also called CNAMEs) and the CloudFront distributions
and Amazon Web Services accounts that they are associated with. In the
list, the distribution and account IDs are partially hidden, which
allows you to identify the distributions and accounts that you own, but
helps to protect the information of ones that you don't own.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Items => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFront::ConflictingAlias>]

Contains the conflicting aliases in the list.


=head2 MaxItems => Int

The maximum number of conflicting aliases requested.


=head2 NextMarker => Str

If there are more items in the list than are in this response, this
element is present. It contains the value that you should use in the
C<Marker> field of a subsequent request to continue listing conflicting
aliases where you left off.


=head2 Quantity => Int

The number of conflicting aliases returned in the response.
