=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyXSSProtection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyXSSProtection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ModeBlock => $value, ..., ReportUri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyXSSProtection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ModeBlock

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Determines whether CloudFront includes the C<X-XSS-Protection> HTTP
response header and the header's value.

For more information about the C<X-XSS-Protection> HTTP response

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ModeBlock => Bool

A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront includes the C<mode=block>
directive in the C<X-XSS-Protection> header.

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Override => Bool

A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront overrides the
C<X-XSS-Protection> HTTP response header received from the origin with
the one specified in this response headers policy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protection => Bool

A Boolean that determines the value of the C<X-XSS-Protection> HTTP
response header. When this setting is C<true>, the value of the
C<X-XSS-Protection> header is C<1>. When this setting is C<false>, the
value of the C<X-XSS-Protection> header is C<0>.

For more information about these settings, see X-XSS-Protection
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection)
in the MDN Web Docs.


=head2 ReportUri => Str

A reporting URI, which CloudFront uses as the value of the C<report>
directive in the C<X-XSS-Protection> header.

You cannot specify a C<ReportUri> when C<ModeBlock> is C<true>.

For more information about using a reporting URL, see X-XSS-Protection
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection)
in the MDN Web Docs.
