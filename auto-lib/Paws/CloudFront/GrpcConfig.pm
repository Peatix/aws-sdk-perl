=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::GrpcConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::GrpcConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., Enabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::GrpcConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon CloudFront supports gRPC, an open-source remote procedure call
(RPC) framework built on HTTP/2. gRPC offers bi-directional streaming
and binary protocol that buffers payloads, making it suitable for
applications that require low latency communications.

To enable your distribution to handle gRPC requests, you must include
HTTP/2 as one of the supported C<HTTP> versions and allow C<HTTP>
methods, including C<POST>.

For more information, see Using gRPC with CloudFront distributions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-using-grpc.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Enables your CloudFront distribution to receive gRPC requests and to
proxy them directly to your origins.
