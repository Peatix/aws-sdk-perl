=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., SigningProtocol => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::OriginAccessControlSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CloudFront origin access control.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A description of the origin access control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The unique identifier of the origin access control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A unique name that identifies the origin access control.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OriginAccessControlOriginType => Str

The type of origin that this origin access control is for.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SigningBehavior => Str

A value that specifies which requests CloudFront signs (adds
authentication information to). This field can have one of the
following values:

=over

=item *

C<never> E<ndash> CloudFront doesn't sign any origin requests.

=item *

C<always> E<ndash> CloudFront signs all origin requests, overwriting
the C<Authorization> header from the viewer request if necessary.

=item *

C<no-override> E<ndash> If the viewer request doesn't contain the
C<Authorization> header, CloudFront signs the origin request. If the
viewer request contains the C<Authorization> header, CloudFront doesn't
sign the origin request, but instead passes along the C<Authorization>
header that it received in the viewer request.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SigningProtocol => Str

The signing protocol of the origin access control. The signing protocol
determines how CloudFront signs (authenticates) requests. The only
valid value is C<sigv4>.
