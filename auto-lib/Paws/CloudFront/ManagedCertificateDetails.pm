  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateArn => $value, ..., ValidationTokenHost => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ManagedCertificateDetails object:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateArn => Str

The ARN of the CloudFront managed ACM certificate.

Your distribution tenant will be updated with the latest certificate
status. When calling the UpdateDistributionTenant
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDistributionTenant.html)
operation, use the latest value for the C<ETag>.


=head2 ValidationTokenDetails => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudFront::ValidationTokenDetail>]

Contains details about the validation token of the specified CloudFront
managed ACM certificate.


=head2 ValidationTokenHost => Str

Contains details about the validation token host of the specified
CloudFront managed ACM certificate.

=over

=item *

For C<cloudfront>, CloudFront will automatically serve the validation
token. Choose this mode if you can point the domain's DNS to CloudFront
immediately.

=item *

For C<self-hosted>, you serve the validation token from your existing
infrastructure. Choose this mode when you need to maintain current
traffic flow while your certificate is being issued. You can place the
validation token at the well-known path on your existing web server,
wait for ACM to validate and issue the certificate, and then update
your DNS to point to CloudFront.

=back

This setting only affects the initial certificate request. Once the DNS
points to CloudFront, all future certificate renewals are automatically
handled through CloudFront.
