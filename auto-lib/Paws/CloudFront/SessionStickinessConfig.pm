=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::SessionStickinessConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::SessionStickinessConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IdleTTL => $value, ..., MaximumTTL => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::SessionStickinessConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IdleTTL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Session stickiness provides the ability to define multiple requests
from a single viewer as a single session. This prevents the potentially
inconsistent experience of sending some of a given user's requests to
your staging distribution, while others are sent to your primary
distribution. Define the session duration using TTL values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IdleTTL => Int

The amount of time after which you want sessions to cease if no
requests are received. Allowed values are 300E<ndash>3600 seconds
(5E<ndash>60 minutes).

The value must be less than or equal to C<MaximumTTL>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaximumTTL => Int

The maximum amount of time to consider requests from the viewer as
being part of the same session. Allowed values are 300E<ndash>3600
seconds (5E<ndash>60 minutes).

The value must be greater than or equal to C<IdleTTL>.
