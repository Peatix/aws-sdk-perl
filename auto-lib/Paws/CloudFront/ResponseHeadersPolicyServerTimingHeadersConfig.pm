=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyServerTimingHeadersConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyServerTimingHeadersConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., SamplingRate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicyServerTimingHeadersConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A configuration for enabling the C<Server-Timing> header in HTTP
responses sent from CloudFront. CloudFront adds this header to HTTP
responses that it sends in response to requests that match a cache
behavior that's associated with this response headers policy.

You can use the C<Server-Timing> header to view metrics that can help
you gain insights about the behavior and performance of CloudFront. For
example, you can see which cache layer served a cache hit, or the first
byte latency from the origin when there was a cache miss. You can use
the metrics in the C<Server-Timing> header to troubleshoot issues or
test the efficiency of your CloudFront configuration. For more
information, see Server-Timing header
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/understanding-response-headers-policies.html#server-timing-header)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront adds the C<Server-Timing>
header to HTTP responses that it sends in response to requests that
match a cache behavior that's associated with this response headers
policy.


=head2 SamplingRate => Num

A number 0E<ndash>100 (inclusive) that specifies the percentage of
responses that you want CloudFront to add the C<Server-Timing> header
to. When you set the sampling rate to 100, CloudFront adds the
C<Server-Timing> header to the HTTP response for every request that
matches the cache behavior that this response headers policy is
attached to. When you set it to 50, CloudFront adds the header to 50%
of the responses for requests that match the cache behavior. You can
set the sampling rate to any number 0E<ndash>100 with up to four
decimal places.
