=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { QueryStringBehavior => $value, ..., QueryStrings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->QueryStringBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that determines whether any URL query strings in viewer
requests (and if so, which query strings) are included in the cache key
and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> QueryStringBehavior => Str

Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are
included in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the
origin. Valid values are:

=over

=item *

C<none> E<ndash> No query strings in viewer requests are included in
the cache key or in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even
when this field is set to C<none>, any query strings that are listed in
an C<OriginRequestPolicy> I<are> included in origin requests.

=item *

C<whitelist> E<ndash> Only the query strings in viewer requests that
are listed in the C<QueryStringNames> type are included in the cache
key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

=item *

C<allExcept> E<ndash> All query strings in viewer requests are included
in the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin,
I< B<except> > those that are listed in the C<QueryStringNames> type,
which are not included.

=item *

C<all> E<ndash> All query strings in viewer requests are included in
the cache key and in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

=back



=head2 QueryStrings => L<Paws::CloudFront::QueryStringNames>

Contains the specific query strings in viewer requests that either I<
B<are> > or I< B<are not> > included in the cache key and in requests
that CloudFront sends to the origin. The behavior depends on whether
the C<QueryStringBehavior> field in the
C<CachePolicyQueryStringsConfig> type is set to C<whitelist> (the
listed query strings I< B<are> > included) or C<allExcept> (the listed
query strings I< B<are not> > included, but all other query strings
are).
