=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::DistributionConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::DistributionConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Aliases => $value, ..., WebACLId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::DistributionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Aliases

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A distribution configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Aliases => L<Paws::CloudFront::Aliases>

A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate domain
names), if any, for this distribution.


=head2 AnycastIpListId => Str

ID of the Anycast static IP list that is associated with the
distribution.


=head2 CacheBehaviors => L<Paws::CloudFront::CacheBehaviors>

A complex type that contains zero or more C<CacheBehavior> elements.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CallerReference => Str

A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the
request can't be replayed.

If the value of C<CallerReference> is new (regardless of the content of
the C<DistributionConfig> object), CloudFront creates a new
distribution.

If C<CallerReference> is a value that you already sent in a previous
request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a
C<DistributionAlreadyExists> error.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Comment => Str

A comment to describe the distribution. The comment cannot be longer
than 128 characters.


=head2 ConnectionMode => Str

The connection mode to filter distributions by.


=head2 ContinuousDeploymentPolicyId => Str

The identifier of a continuous deployment policy. For more information,
see C<CreateContinuousDeploymentPolicy>.


=head2 CustomErrorResponses => L<Paws::CloudFront::CustomErrorResponses>

A complex type that controls the following:

=over

=item *

Whether CloudFront replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range
with custom error messages before returning the response to the viewer.

=item *

How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and 5xx range.

=back

For more information about custom error pages, see Customizing Error
Responses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/custom-error-pages.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultCacheBehavior => L<Paws::CloudFront::DefaultCacheBehavior>

A complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you don't
specify a C<CacheBehavior> element or if files don't match any of the
values of C<PathPattern> in C<CacheBehavior> elements. You must create
exactly one default cache behavior.


=head2 DefaultRootObject => Str

When a viewer requests the root URL for your distribution, the default
root object is the object that you want CloudFront to request from your
origin. For example, if your root URL is C<https://www.example.com>,
you can specify CloudFront to return the C<index.html> file as the
default root object. You can specify a default root object so that
viewers see a specific file or object, instead of another object in
your distribution (for example,
C<https://www.example.com/product-description.html>). A default root
object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

You can specify the object name or a path to the object name (for
example, C<index.html> or C<exampleFolderName/index.html>). Your string
can't begin with a forward slash (C</>). Only specify the object name
or the path to the object.

If you don't want to specify a default root object when you create a
distribution, include an empty C<DefaultRootObject> element.

To delete the default root object from an existing distribution, update
the distribution configuration and include an empty
C<DefaultRootObject> element.

To replace the default root object, update the distribution
configuration and specify the new object.

For more information about the default root object, see Specify a
default root object
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DefaultRootObject.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

From this field, you can enable or disable the selected distribution.


=head2 HttpVersion => Str

(Optional) Specify the HTTP version(s) that you want viewers to use to
communicate with CloudFront. The default value for new web
distributions is C<http2>. Viewers that don't support HTTP/2
automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must support TLSv1.2
or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI).

For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/3, viewers must support TLSv1.3
and Server Name Indication (SNI). CloudFront supports HTTP/3 connection
migration to allow the viewer to switch networks without losing
connection. For more information about connection migration, see
Connection Migration
(https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-connection-migration)
at RFC 9000. For more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see
Supported protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/secure-connections-supported-viewer-protocols-ciphers.html).


=head2 IsIPV6Enabled => Bool

If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an IPv6
address for your distribution, specify C<true>. If you specify
C<false>, CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the DNS
response code C<NOERROR> and with no IP addresses. This allows viewers
to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your distribution.

In general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6 networks
who want to access your content. However, if you're using signed URLs
or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're
using a custom policy that includes the C<IpAddress> parameter to
restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable
IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and
not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP
address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see
Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-creating-signed-url-custom-policy.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.

If you're using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration alias
resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront distribution,
you need to create a second alias resource record set when both of the
following are true:

=over

=item *

You enable IPv6 for the distribution

=item *

You're using alternate domain names in the URLs for your objects

=back

For more information, see Routing Traffic to an Amazon CloudFront Web
Distribution by Using Your Domain Name
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html)
in the I<Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide>.

If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53 Amazon
Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you don't need to
make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your
distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.


=head2 Logging => L<Paws::CloudFront::LoggingConfig>

A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for the
distribution.

For more information about logging, see Access Logs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/AccessLogs.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.


=head2 OriginGroups => L<Paws::CloudFront::OriginGroups>

A complex type that contains information about origin groups for this
distribution.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Origins => L<Paws::CloudFront::Origins>

A complex type that contains information about origins for this
distribution.


=head2 PriceClass => Str

The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you want
to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify C<PriceClass_All>,
CloudFront responds to requests for your objects from all CloudFront
edge locations.

If you specify a price class other than C<PriceClass_All>, CloudFront
serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that has the
lowest latency among the edge locations in your price class. Viewers
who are in or near regions that are excluded from your specified price
class may encounter slower performance.

For more information about price classes, see Choosing the Price Class
for a CloudFront Distribution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PriceClass.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>. For information about
CloudFront pricing, including how price classes (such as Price Class
100) map to CloudFront regions, see Amazon CloudFront Pricing
(http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/).


=head2 Restrictions => L<Paws::CloudFront::Restrictions>

A complex type that identifies ways in which you want to restrict
distribution of your content.


=head2 Staging => Bool

A Boolean that indicates whether this is a staging distribution. When
this value is C<true>, this is a staging distribution. When this value
is C<false>, this is not a staging distribution.


=head2 TenantConfig => L<Paws::CloudFront::TenantConfig>

A distribution tenant configuration.


=head2 ViewerCertificate => L<Paws::CloudFront::ViewerCertificate>

A complex type that determines the distribution's SSL/TLS configuration
for communicating with viewers.


=head2 WebACLId => Str

A unique identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to
associate with this distribution. To specify a web ACL created using
the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example
C<arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWebACL/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111>.
To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for
example C<a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111>.

WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and
HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control
access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as
the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query
strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested
content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also
configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is
blocked. For more information about WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html).
