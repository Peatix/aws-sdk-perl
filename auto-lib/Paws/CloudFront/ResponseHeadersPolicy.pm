=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Id => $value, ..., ResponseHeadersPolicyConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudFront::ResponseHeadersPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A response headers policy.

A response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP
response headers.

After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID to
attach it to one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution.
When it's attached to a cache behavior, the response headers policy
affects the HTTP headers that CloudFront includes in HTTP responses to
requests that match the cache behavior. CloudFront adds or removes
response headers according to the configuration of the response headers
policy.

For more information, see Adding or removing HTTP headers in CloudFront
responses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/modifying-response-headers.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide>.
