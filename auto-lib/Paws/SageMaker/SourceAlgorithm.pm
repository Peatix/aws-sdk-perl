=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::SourceAlgorithm

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::SourceAlgorithm object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlgorithmName => $value, ..., ModelDataUrl => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::SourceAlgorithm object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlgorithmName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies an algorithm that was used to create the model package. The
algorithm must be either an algorithm resource in your SageMaker
account or an algorithm in Amazon Web Services Marketplace that you are
subscribed to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AlgorithmName => Str

The name of an algorithm that was used to create the model package. The
algorithm must be either an algorithm resource in your SageMaker
account or an algorithm in Amazon Web Services Marketplace that you are
subscribed to.


=head2 ModelDataETag => Str

The ETag associated with Model Data URL.


=head2 ModelDataSource => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelDataSource>

Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy during endpoint
creation.


=head2 ModelDataUrl => Str

The Amazon S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model
training, are stored. This path must point to a single C<gzip>
compressed tar archive (C<.tar.gz> suffix).

The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in the same Amazon
Web Services region as the algorithm.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
