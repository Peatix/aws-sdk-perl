=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentRollingUpdatePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentRollingUpdatePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumBatchSize => $value, ..., WaitIntervalInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentRollingUpdatePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumBatchSize

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a rolling deployment strategy for updating a SageMaker AI
inference component.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaximumBatchSize => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentCapacitySize>

The batch size for each rolling step in the deployment process. For
each step, SageMaker AI provisions capacity on the new endpoint fleet,
routes traffic to that fleet, and terminates capacity on the old
endpoint fleet. The value must be between 5% to 50% of the copy count
of the inference component.


=head2 MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds => Int

The time limit for the total deployment. Exceeding this limit causes a
timeout.


=head2 RollbackMaximumBatchSize => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentCapacitySize>

The batch size for a rollback to the old endpoint fleet. If this field
is absent, the value is set to the default, which is 100% of the total
capacity. When the default is used, SageMaker AI provisions the entire
capacity of the old fleet at once during rollback.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WaitIntervalInSeconds => Int

The length of the baking period, during which SageMaker AI monitors
alarms for each batch on the new fleet.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
