=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::Stairs

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::Stairs object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DurationInSeconds => $value, ..., UsersPerStep => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::Stairs object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DurationInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the stairs traffic pattern for an Inference Recommender load
test. This pattern type consists of multiple steps where the number of
users increases at each step.

Specify either the stairs or phases traffic pattern.

=head2 DurationInSeconds => Int

Defines how long each traffic step should be.


=head2 NumberOfSteps => Int

Specifies how many steps to perform during traffic.


=head2 UsersPerStep => Int
