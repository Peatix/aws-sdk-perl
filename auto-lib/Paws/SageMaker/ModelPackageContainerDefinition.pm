=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageContainerDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageContainerDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalS3DataSource => $value, ..., ProductId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageContainerDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalS3DataSource

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the Docker container for the model package.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalS3DataSource => L<Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalS3DataSource>

The additional data source that is used during inference in the Docker
container for your model package.


=head2 ContainerHostname => Str

The DNS host name for the Docker container.


=head2 Environment => L<Paws::SageMaker::EnvironmentMap>

The environment variables to set in the Docker container. Each key and
value in the C<Environment> string to string map can have length of up
to 1024. We support up to 16 entries in the map.


=head2 Framework => Str

The machine learning framework of the model package container image.


=head2 FrameworkVersion => Str

The framework version of the Model Package Container Image.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Image => Str

The Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) path where inference
code is stored.

If you are using your own custom algorithm instead of an algorithm
provided by SageMaker, the inference code must meet SageMaker
requirements. SageMaker supports both C<registry/repository[:tag]> and
C<registry/repository[@digest]> image path formats. For more
information, see Using Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms.html).


=head2 ImageDigest => Str

An MD5 hash of the training algorithm that identifies the Docker image
used for training.


=head2 ModelDataETag => Str

The ETag associated with Model Data URL.


=head2 ModelDataSource => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelDataSource>

Specifies the location of ML model data to deploy during endpoint
creation.


=head2 ModelDataUrl => Str

The Amazon S3 path where the model artifacts, which result from model
training, are stored. This path must point to a single C<gzip>
compressed tar archive (C<.tar.gz> suffix).

The model artifacts must be in an S3 bucket that is in the same region
as the model package.


=head2 ModelInput => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelInput>

A structure with Model Input details.


=head2 NearestModelName => Str

The name of a pre-trained machine learning benchmarked by Amazon
SageMaker Inference Recommender model that matches your model. You can
find a list of benchmarked models by calling C<ListModelMetadata>.


=head2 ProductId => Str

The Amazon Web Services Marketplace product ID of the model package.



=head1 SEE ALSO
