=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesForecastingSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AmazonForecastRoleArn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesForecastingSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AmazonForecastRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Time series forecast settings for the SageMaker Canvas application.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AmazonForecastRoleArn => Str

The IAM role that Canvas passes to Amazon Forecast for time series
forecasting. By default, Canvas uses the execution role specified in
the C<UserProfile> that launches the Canvas application. If an
execution role is not specified in the C<UserProfile>, Canvas uses the
execution role specified in the Domain that owns the C<UserProfile>. To
allow time series forecasting, this IAM role should have the
AmazonSageMakerCanvasForecastAccess
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam-awsmanpol-canvas.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmazonSageMakerCanvasForecastAccess)
policy attached and C<forecast.amazonaws.com> added in the trust
relationship as a service principal.


=head2 Status => Str

Describes whether time series forecasting is enabled or disabled in the
Canvas application.
