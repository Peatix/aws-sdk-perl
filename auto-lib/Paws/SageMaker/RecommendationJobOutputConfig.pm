=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobOutputConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobOutputConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompiledOutputConfig => $value, ..., KmsKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobOutputConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompiledOutputConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the output configuration for the compiled
model.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompiledOutputConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobCompiledOutputConfig>

Provides information about the output configuration for the compiled
model.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Amazon Web Services Key Management
Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to
encrypt your output artifacts with Amazon S3 server-side encryption.
The SageMaker execution role must have C<kms:GenerateDataKey>
permission.

The C<KmsKeyId> can be any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:E<lt>regionE<gt>:E<lt>accountE<gt>:key/E<lt>key-id-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890abE<gt>">
