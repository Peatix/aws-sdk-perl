=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ModelAccessConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ModelAccessConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceptEula => $value, ..., AcceptEula => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ModelAccessConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceptEula

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The access configuration file to control access to the ML model. You
can explicitly accept the model end-user license agreement (EULA)
within the C<ModelAccessConfig>.

section for more details on accepting the EULA.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AcceptEula => Bool

Specifies agreement to the model end-user license agreement (EULA). The
C<AcceptEula> value must be explicitly defined as C<True> in order to

reviewing and complying with any applicable license terms and making
sure they are acceptable for your use case before downloading or using
a model.
