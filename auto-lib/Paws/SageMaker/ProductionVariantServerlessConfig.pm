=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantServerlessConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantServerlessConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxConcurrency => $value, ..., ProvisionedConcurrency => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantServerlessConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxConcurrency

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the serverless configuration for an endpoint variant.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxConcurrency => Int

The maximum number of concurrent invocations your serverless endpoint
can process.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MemorySizeInMB => Int

The memory size of your serverless endpoint. Valid values are in 1 GB
increments: 1024 MB, 2048 MB, 3072 MB, 4096 MB, 5120 MB, or 6144 MB.


=head2 ProvisionedConcurrency => Int

The amount of provisioned concurrency to allocate for the serverless
endpoint. Should be less than or equal to C<MaxConcurrency>.

This field is not supported for serverless endpoint recommendations for
Inference Recommender jobs. For more information about creating an
Inference Recommender job, see CreateInferenceRecommendationsJobs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateInferenceRecommendationsJob.html).
