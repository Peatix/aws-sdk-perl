Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageModelCard object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ModelCardContent => $value, ..., ModelCardStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageModelCard object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ModelCardContent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The model card associated with the model package. Since
C<ModelPackageModelCard> is tied to a model package, it is a specific
usage of a model card and its schema is simplified compared to the
schema of C<ModelCard>. The C<ModelPackageModelCard> schema does not
include C<model_package_details>, and C<model_overview> is composed of
the C<model_creator> and C<model_artifact> properties. For more
information about the model package model card schema, see Model
package model card schema
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html#model-card-schema).
For more information about the model card associated with the model
package, see View the Details of a Model Version
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-registry-details.html).
