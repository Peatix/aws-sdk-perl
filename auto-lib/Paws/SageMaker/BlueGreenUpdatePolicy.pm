=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::BlueGreenUpdatePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::BlueGreenUpdatePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds => $value, ..., TrafficRoutingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::BlueGreenUpdatePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Update policy for a blue/green deployment. If this update policy is
specified, SageMaker creates a new fleet during the deployment while
maintaining the old fleet. SageMaker flips traffic to the new fleet
according to the specified traffic routing configuration. Only one
update policy should be used in the deployment configuration. If no
update policy is specified, SageMaker uses a blue/green deployment
strategy with all at once traffic shifting by default.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds => Int

Maximum execution timeout for the deployment. Note that the timeout
value should be larger than the total waiting time specified in
C<TerminationWaitInSeconds> and C<WaitIntervalInSeconds>.


=head2 TerminationWaitInSeconds => Int

Additional waiting time in seconds after the completion of an endpoint
deployment before terminating the old endpoint fleet. Default is 0.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrafficRoutingConfiguration => L<Paws::SageMaker::TrafficRoutingConfig>

Defines the traffic routing strategy to shift traffic from the old
fleet to the new fleet during an endpoint deployment.
