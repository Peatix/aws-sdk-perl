=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::IamPolicyConstraints

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::IamPolicyConstraints object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SourceIp => $value, ..., VpcSourceIp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::IamPolicyConstraints object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SourceIp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this parameter to specify a supported global condition key that is
added to the IAM policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SourceIp => Str

When C<SourceIp> is C<Enabled> the worker's IP address when a task is
rendered in the worker portal is added to the IAM policy as a
C<Condition> used to generate the Amazon S3 presigned URL. This IP
address is checked by Amazon S3 and must match in order for the Amazon
S3 resource to be rendered in the worker portal.


=head2 VpcSourceIp => Str

When C<VpcSourceIp> is C<Enabled> the worker's IP address when a task
is rendered in private worker portal inside the VPC is added to the IAM
policy as a C<Condition> used to generate the Amazon S3 presigned URL.
To render the task successfully Amazon S3 checks that the presigned URL
is being accessed over an Amazon S3 VPC Endpoint, and that the worker's
IP address matches the IP address in the IAM policy. To learn more
about configuring private worker portal, see Use Amazon VPC mode from a
private worker portal
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/samurai-vpc-worker-portal.html).
