=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobChannel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobChannel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelType => $value, ..., DataSource => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobChannel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A channel is a named input source that training algorithms can consume.
This channel is used for AutoML jobs V2 (jobs created by calling
CreateAutoMLJobV2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJobV2.html)).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelType => Str

The type of channel. Defines whether the data are used for training or
validation. The default value is C<training>. Channels for C<training>
and C<validation> must share the same C<ContentType>

The type of channel defaults to C<training> for the time-series
forecasting problem type.


=head2 CompressionType => Str

The allowed compression types depend on the input format and problem
type. We allow the compression type C<Gzip> for C<S3Prefix> inputs on
tabular data only. For all other inputs, the compression type should be
C<None>. If no compression type is provided, we default to C<None>.


=head2 ContentType => Str

The content type of the data from the input source. The following are
the allowed content types for different problems:

=over

=item *

For tabular problem types: C<text/csv;header=present> or
C<x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet>. The default value is
C<text/csv;header=present>.

=item *

For image classification: C<image/png>, C<image/jpeg>, or C<image/*>.
The default value is C<image/*>.

=item *

For text classification: C<text/csv;header=present> or
C<x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet>. The default value is
C<text/csv;header=present>.

=item *

For time-series forecasting: C<text/csv;header=present> or
C<x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet>. The default value is
C<text/csv;header=present>.

=item *

For text generation (LLMs fine-tuning): C<text/csv;header=present> or
C<x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet>. The default value is
C<text/csv;header=present>.

=back



=head2 DataSource => L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLDataSource>

The data source for an AutoML channel (Required).
