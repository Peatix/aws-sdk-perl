=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RollingUpdatePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RollingUpdatePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumBatchSize => $value, ..., WaitIntervalInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RollingUpdatePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumBatchSize

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a rolling deployment strategy for updating a SageMaker
endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaximumBatchSize => L<Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize>

Batch size for each rolling step to provision capacity and turn on
traffic on the new endpoint fleet, and terminate capacity on the old
endpoint fleet. Value must be between 5% to 50% of the variant's total
instance count.


=head2 MaximumExecutionTimeoutInSeconds => Int

The time limit for the total deployment. Exceeding this limit causes a
timeout.


=head2 RollbackMaximumBatchSize => L<Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize>

Batch size for rollback to the old endpoint fleet. Each rolling step to
provision capacity and turn on traffic on the old endpoint fleet, and
terminate capacity on the new endpoint fleet. If this field is absent,
the default value will be set to 100% of total capacity which means to
bring up the whole capacity of the old fleet at once during rollback.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WaitIntervalInSeconds => Int

The length of the baking period, during which SageMaker monitors alarms
for each batch on the new fleet.



=head1 SEE ALSO
