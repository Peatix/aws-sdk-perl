=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TransformResources

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TransformResources object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceCount => $value, ..., VolumeKmsKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TransformResources object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the resources, including ML instance types and ML instance
count, to use for transform job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceCount => Int

The number of ML compute instances to use in the transform job. The
default value is C<1>, and the maximum is C<100>. For distributed
transform jobs, specify a value greater than C<1>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The ML compute instance type for the transform job. If you are using
built-in algorithms to transform moderately sized datasets, we
recommend using ml.m4.xlarge or C<ml.m5.large>instance types.


=head2 TransformAmiVersion => Str

Specifies an option from a collection of preconfigured Amazon Machine
Image (AMI) images. Each image is configured by Amazon Web Services
with a set of software and driver versions.

=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt model data on the
storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the
batch transform job.

Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on the
instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware
module on the instance. You can't request a C<VolumeKmsKeyId> when
using an instance type with local storage.

For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, see
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).

For more information about local instance storage encryption, see SSD
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html).

The C<VolumeKmsKeyId> can be any of the following formats:
