=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TrafficRoutingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TrafficRoutingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CanarySize => $value, ..., WaitIntervalInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TrafficRoutingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CanarySize

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the traffic routing strategy during an endpoint deployment to
shift traffic from the old fleet to the new fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CanarySize => L<Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize>

Batch size for the first step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint
fleet. C<Value> must be less than or equal to 50% of the variant's
total instance count.


=head2 LinearStepSize => L<Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize>

Batch size for each step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet.
C<Value> must be 10-50% of the variant's total instance count.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

Traffic routing strategy type.

=over

=item *

C<ALL_AT_ONCE>: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in a single
step.

=item *

C<CANARY>: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in two steps. The
first step is the canary, which is a small portion of the traffic. The
second step is the remainder of the traffic.

=item *

C<LINEAR>: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in n steps of a
configurable size.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> WaitIntervalInSeconds => Int

The waiting time (in seconds) between incremental steps to turn on
traffic on the new endpoint fleet.
