=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ModelInfrastructureConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ModelInfrastructureConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InfrastructureType => $value, ..., RealTimeInferenceConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ModelInfrastructureConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InfrastructureType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the infrastructure that the model will be
deployed to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InfrastructureType => Str

The inference option to which to deploy your model. Possible values are
the following:

=over

=item *

C<RealTime>: Deploy to real-time inference.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RealTimeInferenceConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::RealTimeInferenceConfig>

The infrastructure configuration for deploying the model to real-time
inference.



=head1 SEE ALSO
