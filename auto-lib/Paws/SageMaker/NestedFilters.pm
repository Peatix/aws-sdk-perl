=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::NestedFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::NestedFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filters => $value, ..., NestedPropertyName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::NestedFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of nested Filter
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Filter.html)
objects. A resource must satisfy the conditions of all filters to be
included in the results returned from the Search
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Search.html)
API.

For example, to filter on a training job's C<InputDataConfig> property
with a specific channel name and C<S3Uri> prefix, define the following
filters:

=over

=item *

C<'{Name:"InputDataConfig.ChannelName", "Operator":"Equals",
"Value":"train"}',>

=item *

C<'{Name:"InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri",
"Operator":"Contains", "Value":"mybucket/catdata"}'>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::Filter>]

A list of filters. Each filter acts on a property. Filters must contain
at least one C<Filters> value. For example, a C<NestedFilters> call
might include a filter on the C<PropertyName> parameter of the
C<InputDataConfig> property:
C<InputDataConfig.DataSource.S3DataSource.S3Uri>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NestedPropertyName => Str

The name of the property to use in the nested filters. The value must
match a listed property name, such as C<InputDataConfig>.
