=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::SpaceSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::SpaceSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppType => $value, ..., SpaceStorageSettings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::SpaceSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of space settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AppType => Str

The type of app created within the space.

If using the UpdateSpace
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSpace.html)
API, you can't change the app type of your space by specifying a
different value for this field.


=head2 CodeEditorAppSettings => L<Paws::SageMaker::SpaceCodeEditorAppSettings>

The Code Editor application settings.


=head2 CustomFileSystems => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::CustomFileSystem>]

A file system, created by you, that you assign to a space for an Amazon
SageMaker AI Domain. Permitted users can access this file system in
Amazon SageMaker AI Studio.


=head2 JupyterLabAppSettings => L<Paws::SageMaker::SpaceJupyterLabAppSettings>

The settings for the JupyterLab application.


=head2 JupyterServerAppSettings => L<Paws::SageMaker::JupyterServerAppSettings>




=head2 KernelGatewayAppSettings => L<Paws::SageMaker::KernelGatewayAppSettings>




=head2 SpaceManagedResources => Str

If you enable this option, SageMaker AI creates the following resources
on your behalf when you create the space:

=over

=item *

The user profile that possesses the space.

=item *

The app that the space contains.

=back



=head2 SpaceStorageSettings => L<Paws::SageMaker::SpaceStorageSettings>

The storage settings for a space.



=head1 SEE ALSO
