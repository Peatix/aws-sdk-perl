=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationMetrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationMetrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CostPerHour => $value, ..., ModelSetupTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationMetrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CostPerHour

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metrics of recommendations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CostPerHour => Num

Defines the cost per hour for the instance.


=head2 CostPerInference => Num

Defines the cost per inference for the instance .


=head2 CpuUtilization => Num

The expected CPU utilization at maximum invocations per minute for the
instance.

C<NaN> indicates that the value is not available.


=head2 MaxInvocations => Int

The expected maximum number of requests per minute for the instance.


=head2 MemoryUtilization => Num

The expected memory utilization at maximum invocations per minute for
the instance.

C<NaN> indicates that the value is not available.


=head2 ModelLatency => Int

The expected model latency at maximum invocation per minute for the
instance.


=head2 ModelSetupTime => Int

The time it takes to launch new compute resources for a serverless
endpoint. The time can vary depending on the model size, how long it
takes to download the model, and the start-up time of the container.

C<NaN> indicates that the value is not available.
