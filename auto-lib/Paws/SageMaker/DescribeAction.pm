=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $DescribeActionResponse = $api . sagemaker->DescribeAction(
      ActionName => 'MyExperimentEntityNameOrArn',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ActionArn          = $DescribeActionResponse->ActionArn;
    my $ActionName         = $DescribeActionResponse->ActionName;
    my $ActionType         = $DescribeActionResponse->ActionType;
    my $CreatedBy          = $DescribeActionResponse->CreatedBy;
    my $CreationTime       = $DescribeActionResponse->CreationTime;
    my $Description        = $DescribeActionResponse->Description;
    my $LastModifiedBy     = $DescribeActionResponse->LastModifiedBy;
    my $LastModifiedTime   = $DescribeActionResponse->LastModifiedTime;
    my $LineageGroupArn    = $DescribeActionResponse->LineageGroupArn;
    my $MetadataProperties = $DescribeActionResponse->MetadataProperties;
    my $Properties         = $DescribeActionResponse->Properties;
    my $Source             = $DescribeActionResponse->Source;
    my $Status             = $DescribeActionResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::DescribeActionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
