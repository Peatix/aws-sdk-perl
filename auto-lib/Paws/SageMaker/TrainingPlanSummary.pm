=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TrainingPlanSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TrainingPlanSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailableInstanceCount => $value, ..., UpfrontFee => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TrainingPlanSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailableInstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details of the training plan.

For more information about how to reserve GPU capacity for your
SageMaker HyperPod clusters using Amazon SageMaker Training Plan, see
C< CreateTrainingPlan
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrainingPlan.html)
>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailableInstanceCount => Int

The number of instances currently available for use in this training
plan.


=head2 CurrencyCode => Str

The currency code for the upfront fee (e.g., USD).


=head2 DurationHours => Int

The number of whole hours in the total duration for this training plan.


=head2 DurationMinutes => Int

The additional minutes beyond whole hours in the total duration for
this training plan.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The end time of the training plan.


=head2 InUseInstanceCount => Int

The number of instances currently in use from this training plan.


=head2 ReservedCapacitySummaries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ReservedCapacitySummary>]

A list of reserved capacities associated with this training plan,
including details such as instance types, counts, and availability
zones.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The start time of the training plan.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The current status of the training plan (e.g., Pending, Active,
Expired). To see the complete list of status values available for a
training plan, refer to the C<Status> attribute within the C<
TrainingPlanSummary
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_TrainingPlanSummary.html)
> object.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A message providing additional information about the current status of
the training plan.


=head2 TargetResources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The target resources (e.g., training jobs, HyperPod clusters) that can
use this training plan.

Training plans are specific to their target resource.

=over

=item *

A training plan designed for SageMaker training jobs can only be used
to schedule and run training jobs.

=item *

A training plan for HyperPod clusters can be used exclusively to
provide compute resources to a cluster's instance group.

=back



=head2 TotalInstanceCount => Int

The total number of instances reserved in this training plan.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrainingPlanArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN); of the training plan.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrainingPlanName => Str

The name of the training plan.


=head2 UpfrontFee => Str

The upfront fee for the training plan.
