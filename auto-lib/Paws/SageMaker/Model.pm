=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::Model

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::Model object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Containers => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::Model object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Containers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The properties of a model as returned by the Search
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Search.html)
API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Containers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ContainerDefinition>]

The containers in the inference pipeline.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A timestamp that indicates when the model was created.


=head2 DeploymentRecommendation => L<Paws::SageMaker::DeploymentRecommendation>

A set of recommended deployment configurations for the model.


=head2 EnableNetworkIsolation => Bool

Isolates the model container. No inbound or outbound network calls can
be made to or from the model container.


=head2 ExecutionRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that you specified for
the model.


=head2 InferenceExecutionConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceExecutionConfig>




=head2 ModelArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model.


=head2 ModelName => Str

The name of the model.


=head2 PrimaryContainer => L<Paws::SageMaker::ContainerDefinition>




=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::Tag>]

A list of key-value pairs associated with the model. For more
information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide>.


=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::VpcConfig>
