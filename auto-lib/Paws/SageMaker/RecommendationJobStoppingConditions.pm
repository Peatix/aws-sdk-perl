=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobStoppingConditions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobStoppingConditions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FlatInvocations => $value, ..., ModelLatencyThresholds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobStoppingConditions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FlatInvocations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies conditions for stopping a job. When a job reaches a stopping
condition limit, SageMaker ends the job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FlatInvocations => Str

Stops a load test when the number of invocations (TPS) peaks and
flattens, which means that the instance has reached capacity. The
default value is C<Stop>. If you want the load test to continue after
invocations have flattened, set the value to C<Continue>.


=head2 MaxInvocations => Int

The maximum number of requests per minute expected for the endpoint.


=head2 ModelLatencyThresholds => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelLatencyThreshold>]

The interval of time taken by a model to respond as viewed from
SageMaker. The interval includes the local communication time taken to
send the request and to fetch the response from the container of a
model and the time taken to complete the inference in the container.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
