=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $DescribeArtifactResponse = $api . sagemaker->DescribeArtifact(
      ArtifactArn => 'MyArtifactArn',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ArtifactArn        = $DescribeArtifactResponse->ArtifactArn;
    my $ArtifactName       = $DescribeArtifactResponse->ArtifactName;
    my $ArtifactType       = $DescribeArtifactResponse->ArtifactType;
    my $CreatedBy          = $DescribeArtifactResponse->CreatedBy;
    my $CreationTime       = $DescribeArtifactResponse->CreationTime;
    my $LastModifiedBy     = $DescribeArtifactResponse->LastModifiedBy;
    my $LastModifiedTime   = $DescribeArtifactResponse->LastModifiedTime;
    my $LineageGroupArn    = $DescribeArtifactResponse->LineageGroupArn;
    my $MetadataProperties = $DescribeArtifactResponse->MetadataProperties;
    my $Properties         = $DescribeArtifactResponse->Properties;
    my $Source             = $DescribeArtifactResponse->Source;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::DescribeArtifactResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
