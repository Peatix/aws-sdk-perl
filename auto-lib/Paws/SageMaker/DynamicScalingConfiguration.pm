=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::DynamicScalingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::DynamicScalingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacity => $value, ..., ScalingPolicies => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::DynamicScalingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object with the recommended values for you to specify when creating
an autoscaling policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Int

The recommended maximum capacity to specify for your autoscaling
policy.


=head2 MinCapacity => Int

The recommended minimum capacity to specify for your autoscaling
policy.


=head2 ScaleInCooldown => Int

The recommended scale in cooldown time for your autoscaling policy.


=head2 ScaleOutCooldown => Int

The recommended scale out cooldown time for your autoscaling policy.


=head2 ScalingPolicies => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ScalingPolicy>]

An object of the scaling policies for each metric.
