=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobModelSourceS3

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobModelSourceS3 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ModelAccessConfig => $value, ..., S3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobModelSourceS3 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ModelAccessConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Amazon S3 location of a source model to optimize with an
optimization job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ModelAccessConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationModelAccessConfig>

The access configuration settings for the source ML model for an
optimization job, where you can accept the model end-user license
agreement (EULA).


=head2 S3Uri => Str

An Amazon S3 URI that locates a source model to optimize with an
optimization job.



=head1 SEE ALSO
