=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ShadowModeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ShadowModeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ShadowModelVariants => $value, ..., SourceModelVariantName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ShadowModeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ShadowModelVariants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of C<ShadowMode> inference experiment type, which
specifies a production variant to take all the inference requests, and
a shadow variant to which Amazon SageMaker replicates a percentage of
the inference requests. For the shadow variant it also specifies the
percentage of requests that Amazon SageMaker replicates.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ShadowModelVariants => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ShadowModelVariantConfig>]

List of shadow variant configurations.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceModelVariantName => Str

The name of the production variant, which takes all the inference
requests.
