=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::KernelGatewayAppSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::KernelGatewayAppSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomImages => $value, ..., LifecycleConfigArns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::KernelGatewayAppSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomImages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The KernelGateway app settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomImages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::CustomImage>]

=head2 DefaultResourceSpec => L<Paws::SageMaker::ResourceSpec>

The default instance type and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
default SageMaker AI image used by the KernelGateway app.

The Amazon SageMaker AI Studio UI does not use the default instance
type value set here. The default instance type set here is used when
Apps are created using the CLI or CloudFormation and the instance type
parameter value is not passed.


=head2 LifecycleConfigArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lifecycle Configurations attached
to the the user profile or domain.

To remove a Lifecycle Config, you must set C<LifecycleConfigArns> to an
empty list.
