=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::InferenceMetrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::InferenceMetrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxInvocations => $value, ..., ModelLatency => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::InferenceMetrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxInvocations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metrics for an existing endpoint compared in an Inference
Recommender job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxInvocations => Int

The expected maximum number of requests per minute for the instance.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelLatency => Int

The expected model latency at maximum invocations per minute for the
instance.
