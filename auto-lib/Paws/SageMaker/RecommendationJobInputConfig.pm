=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobInputConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobInputConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerConfig => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobInputConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input configuration of the recommendation job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobContainerConfig>

Specifies mandatory fields for running an Inference Recommender job.
The fields specified in C<ContainerConfig> override the corresponding
fields in the model package.


=head2 EndpointConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::EndpointInputConfiguration>]

Specifies the endpoint configuration to use for a job.


=head2 Endpoints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::EndpointInfo>]

Existing customer endpoints on which to run an Inference Recommender
job.


=head2 JobDurationInSeconds => Int

Specifies the maximum duration of the job, in seconds. The maximum
value is 18,000 seconds.


=head2 ModelName => Str

The name of the created model.


=head2 ModelPackageVersionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a versioned model package.


=head2 ResourceLimit => L<Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobResourceLimit>

Defines the resource limit of the job.


=head2 TrafficPattern => L<Paws::SageMaker::TrafficPattern>

Specifies the traffic pattern of the job.


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Amazon Web Services Key Management
Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to
encrypt data on the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance
that hosts the endpoint. This key will be passed to SageMaker Hosting
for endpoint creation.

The SageMaker execution role must have C<kms:CreateGrant> permission in
order to encrypt data on the storage volume of the endpoints created
for inference recommendation. The inference recommendation job will
fail asynchronously during endpoint configuration creation if the role
passed does not have C<kms:CreateGrant> permission.

The C<KmsKeyId> can be any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:E<lt>regionE<gt>:E<lt>accountE<gt>:key/E<lt>key-id-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890abE<gt>">

=item *

// KMS Key Alias

C<"alias/ExampleAlias">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias

C<"arn:aws:kms:E<lt>regionE<gt>:E<lt>accountE<gt>:alias/E<lt>ExampleAliasE<gt>">

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id-key-id)
in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
KMS) documentation.


=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobVpcConfig>

Inference Recommender provisions SageMaker endpoints with access to VPC
in the inference recommendation job.
