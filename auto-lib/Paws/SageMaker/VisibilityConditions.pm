Paws::SageMaker::VisibilityConditions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::VisibilityConditions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::VisibilityConditions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The list of key-value pairs used to filter your search results. If a
search result contains a key from your list, it is included in the

result is excluded from the search response. Any resources that don't
have a key from the list that you've provided will also be included in
the search response.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

results. It must be in the following format: C<Tags.E<lt>keyE<gt>>.
