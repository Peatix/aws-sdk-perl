=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::MetricDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::MetricDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Regex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::MetricDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a metric that the training algorithm writes to C<stderr> or
C<stdout>. You can view these logs to understand how your training job
performs and check for any errors encountered during training.
SageMaker hyperparameter tuning captures all defined metrics. Specify
one of the defined metrics to use as an objective metric using the
TuningObjective
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition.html#sagemaker-Type-HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition-TuningObjective)
parameter in the C<HyperParameterTrainingJobDefinition> API to evaluate
job performance during hyperparameter tuning.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the metric.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Regex => Str

A regular expression that searches the output of a training job and
gets the value of the metric. For more information about using regular
expressions to define metrics, see Defining metrics and environment
variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-define-metrics-variables.html).
