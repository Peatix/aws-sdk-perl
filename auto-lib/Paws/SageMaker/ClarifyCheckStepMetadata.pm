=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyCheckStepMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyCheckStepMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaselineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints => $value, ..., ViolationReport => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyCheckStepMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaselineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The container for the metadata for the ClarifyCheck step. For more
information, see the topic on ClarifyCheck step
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/build-and-manage-steps.html#step-type-clarify-check)
in the I<Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaselineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints => Str

The Amazon S3 URI of baseline constraints file to be used for the drift
check.


=head2 CalculatedBaselineConstraints => Str

The Amazon S3 URI of the newly calculated baseline constraints file.


=head2 CheckJobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the check processing job that was run
by this step's execution.


=head2 CheckType => Str

The type of the Clarify Check step


=head2 ModelPackageGroupName => Str

The model package group name.


=head2 RegisterNewBaseline => Bool

This flag indicates if a newly calculated baseline can be accessed
through step properties C<BaselineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints> and
C<BaselineUsedForDriftCheckStatistics>. If it is set to C<False>, the
previous baseline of the configured check type must also be available.
These can be accessed through the
C<BaselineUsedForDriftCheckConstraints> property.


=head2 SkipCheck => Bool

This flag indicates if the drift check against the previous baseline
will be skipped or not. If it is set to C<False>, the previous baseline
of the configured check type must be available.


=head2 ViolationReport => Str

The Amazon S3 URI of the violation report if violations are detected.
