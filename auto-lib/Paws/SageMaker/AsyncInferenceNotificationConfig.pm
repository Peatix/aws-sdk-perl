=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceNotificationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceNotificationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorTopic => $value, ..., SuccessTopic => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceNotificationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorTopic

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration for notifications of inference results for
asynchronous inference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorTopic => Str

Amazon SNS topic to post a notification to when inference fails. If no
topic is provided, no notification is sent on failure.


=head2 IncludeInferenceResponseIn => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon SNS topics where you want the inference response to be
included.

The inference response is included only if the response size is less
than or equal to 128 KB.


=head2 SuccessTopic => Str

Amazon SNS topic to post a notification to when inference completes
successfully. If no topic is provided, no notification is sent on
success.
