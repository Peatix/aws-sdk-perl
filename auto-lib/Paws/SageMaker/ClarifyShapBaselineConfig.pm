=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapBaselineConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapBaselineConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MimeType => $value, ..., ShapBaselineUri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapBaselineConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MimeType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the SHAP baseline
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-feature-attribute-shap-baselines.html)
(also called the background or reference dataset) of the Kernal SHAP
algorithm.

=over

=item *

The number of records in the baseline data determines the size of the
synthetic dataset, which has an impact on latency of explainability
requests. For more information, see the B<Synthetic data> of Configure
and create an endpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-online-explainability-create-endpoint.html).

=item *

C<ShapBaseline> and C<ShapBaselineUri> are mutually exclusive
parameters. One or the either is required to configure a SHAP baseline.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MimeType => Str

The MIME type of the baseline data. Choose from C<'text/csv'> or
C<'application/jsonlines'>. Defaults to C<'text/csv'>.


=head2 ShapBaseline => Str

The inline SHAP baseline data in string format. C<ShapBaseline> can
have one or multiple records to be used as the baseline dataset. The
format of the SHAP baseline file should be the same format as the
training dataset. For example, if the training dataset is in CSV format
and each record contains four features, and all features are numerical,
then the format of the baseline data should also share these
characteristics. For natural language processing (NLP) of text columns,
the baseline value should be the value used to replace the unit of text
specified by the C<Granularity> of the C<TextConfig> parameter. The
size limit for C<ShapBasline> is 4 KB. Use the C<ShapBaselineUri>
parameter if you want to provide more than 4 KB of baseline data.


=head2 ShapBaselineUri => Str

The uniform resource identifier (URI) of the S3 bucket where the SHAP
baseline file is stored. The format of the SHAP baseline file should be
the same format as the format of the training dataset. For example, if
the training dataset is in CSV format, and each record in the training
dataset has four features, and all features are numerical, then the
baseline file should also have this same format. Each record should
contain only the features. If you are using a virtual private cloud
(VPC), the C<ShapBaselineUri> should be accessible to the VPC. For more
information about setting up endpoints with Amazon Virtual Private
Cloud, see Give SageMaker access to Resources in your Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/infrastructure-give-access.html).
