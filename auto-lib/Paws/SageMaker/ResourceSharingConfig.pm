=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ResourceSharingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ResourceSharingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BorrowLimit => $value, ..., Strategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ResourceSharingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BorrowLimit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Resource sharing configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BorrowLimit => Int

The limit on how much idle compute can be borrowed.The values can be 1
- 500 percent of idle compute that the team is allowed to borrow.

Default is C<50>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Strategy => Str

The strategy of how idle compute is shared within the cluster. The
following are the options of strategies.

=over

=item *

C<DontLend>: entities do not lend idle compute.

=item *

C<Lend>: entities can lend idle compute to entities that can borrow.

=item *

C<LendandBorrow>: entities can lend idle compute and borrow idle
compute from other entities.

=back

Default is C<LendandBorrow>.
