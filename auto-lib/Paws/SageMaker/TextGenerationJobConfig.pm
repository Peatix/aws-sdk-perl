=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TextGenerationJobConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TextGenerationJobConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseModelName => $value, ..., TextGenerationHyperParameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TextGenerationJobConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseModelName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The collection of settings used by an AutoML job V2 for the text
generation problem type.

The text generation models that support fine-tuning in Autopilot are
currently accessible exclusively in regions supported by Canvas. Refer
to the documentation of Canvas for the full list of its supported
Regions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaseModelName => Str

The name of the base model to fine-tune. Autopilot supports fine-tuning
a variety of large language models. For information on the list of
supported models, see Text generation models supporting fine-tuning in
Autopilot
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-llms-finetuning-models.html#autopilot-llms-finetuning-supported-llms).
If no C<BaseModelName> is provided, the default model used is
B<Falcon7BInstruct>.


=head2 CompletionCriteria => L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria>

How long a fine-tuning job is allowed to run. For
C<TextGenerationJobConfig> problem types, the
C<MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds> attribute of
C<AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria> defaults to 72h (259200s).


=head2 ModelAccessConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelAccessConfig>




=head2 TextGenerationHyperParameters => L<Paws::SageMaker::TextGenerationHyperParameters>

The hyperparameters used to configure and optimize the learning process
of the base model. You can set any combination of the following
hyperparameters for all base models. For more information on each
supported hyperparameter, see Optimize the learning process of your
text generation models with hyperparameters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-llms-finetuning-set-hyperparameters.html).

=item *

C<"epochCount">: The number of times the model goes through the entire
training dataset. Its value should be a string containing an integer
value within the range of "1" to "10".

=item *

C<"batchSize">: The number of data samples used in each iteration of
training. Its value should be a string containing an integer value
within the range of "1" to "64".

=item *

C<"learningRate">: The step size at which a model's parameters are
updated during training. Its value should be a string containing a
floating-point value within the range of "0" to "1".

=item *

C<"learningRateWarmupSteps">: The number of training steps during which
the learning rate gradually increases before reaching its target or
maximum value. Its value should be a string containing an integer value
within the range of "0" to "250".

=back

Here is an example where all four hyperparameters are configured.

C<{ "epochCount":"5", "learningRate":"0.5", "batchSize": "32",
"learningRateWarmupSteps": "10" }>
