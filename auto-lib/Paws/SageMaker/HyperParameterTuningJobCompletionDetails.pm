=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobCompletionDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobCompletionDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConvergenceDetectedTime => $value, ..., NumberOfTrainingJobsObjectiveNotImproving => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobCompletionDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConvergenceDetectedTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains runtime information about both current and
completed hyperparameter tuning jobs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConvergenceDetectedTime => Str

The time in timestamp format that AMT detected model convergence, as
defined by a lack of significant improvement over time based on
criteria developed over a wide range of diverse benchmarking tests.


=head2 NumberOfTrainingJobsObjectiveNotImproving => Int

The number of training jobs launched by a tuning job that are not
improving (1% or less) as measured by model performance evaluated
against an objective function.
