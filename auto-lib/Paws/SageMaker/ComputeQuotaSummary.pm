=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivationState => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivationState

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary of the compute allocation definition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActivationState => Str

The state of the compute allocation being described. Use to enable or
disable compute allocation.

Default is C<Enabled>.


=head2 ClusterArn => Str

ARN of the cluster.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComputeQuotaArn => Str

ARN of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 ComputeQuotaConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaConfig>

Configuration of the compute allocation definition. This includes the
resource sharing option, and the setting to preempt low priority tasks.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComputeQuotaId => Str

ID of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComputeQuotaTarget => L<Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaTarget>

The target entity to allocate compute resources to.


=head2 ComputeQuotaVersion => Int

Version of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

Creation time of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

Last modified time of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

Name of the compute allocation definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Status of the compute allocation definition.



=head1 SEE ALSO
