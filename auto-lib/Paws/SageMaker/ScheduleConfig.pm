=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ScheduleConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ScheduleConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataAnalysisEndTime => $value, ..., ScheduleExpression => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ScheduleConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataAnalysisEndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration details about the monitoring schedule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataAnalysisEndTime => Str

Sets the end time for a monitoring job window. Express this time as an
offset to the times that you schedule your monitoring jobs to run. You
schedule monitoring jobs with the C<ScheduleExpression> parameter.
Specify this offset in ISO 8601 duration format. For example, if you
want to end the window one hour before the start of each monitoring
job, you would specify: C<"-PT1H">.

The end time that you specify must not follow the start time that you
specify by more than 24 hours. You specify the start time with the
C<DataAnalysisStartTime> parameter.

If you set C<ScheduleExpression> to C<NOW>, this parameter is required.


=head2 DataAnalysisStartTime => Str

Sets the start time for a monitoring job window. Express this time as
an offset to the times that you schedule your monitoring jobs to run.
You schedule monitoring jobs with the C<ScheduleExpression> parameter.
Specify this offset in ISO 8601 duration format. For example, if you
want to monitor the five hours of data in your dataset that precede the
start of each monitoring job, you would specify: C<"-PT5H">.

The start time that you specify must not precede the end time that you
specify by more than 24 hours. You specify the end time with the
C<DataAnalysisEndTime> parameter.

If you set C<ScheduleExpression> to C<NOW>, this parameter is required.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduleExpression => Str

A cron expression that describes details about the monitoring schedule.

The supported cron expressions are:

=over

=item *

If you want to set the job to start every hour, use the following:

C<Hourly: cron(0 * ? * * *)>

=item *

If you want to start the job daily:

C<cron(0 [00-23] ? * * *)>

=item *

If you want to run the job one time, immediately, use the following
keyword:

C<NOW>

=back

For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

=over

=item *

Daily at noon UTC: C<cron(0 12 ? * * *)>

=item *

Daily at midnight UTC: C<cron(0 0 ? * * *)>

=back

To support running every 6, 12 hours, the following are also supported:

C<cron(0 [00-23]/[01-24] ? * * *)>

For example, the following are valid cron expressions:

=over

=item *

Every 12 hours, starting at 5pm UTC: C<cron(0 17/12 ? * * *)>

=item *

Every two hours starting at midnight: C<cron(0 0/2 ? * * *)>

=back

=over

=item *

Even though the cron expression is set to start at 5PM UTC, note that
there could be a delay of 0-20 minutes from the actual requested time
to run the execution.

=item *

We recommend that if you would like a daily schedule, you do not
provide this parameter. Amazon SageMaker AI will pick a time for
running every day.

=back

You can also specify the keyword C<NOW> to run the monitoring job
immediately, one time, without recurring.
