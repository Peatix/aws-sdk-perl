=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $CreateWorkteamResponse = $api . sagemaker->CreateWorkteam(
      Description       => 'MyString200',
      MemberDefinitions => [
        {
          CognitoMemberDefinition => {
            ClientId  => 'MyClientId',            # min: 1, max: 1024
            UserGroup => 'MyCognitoUserGroup',    # min: 1, max: 128
            UserPool  => 'MyCognitoUserPool',     # min: 1, max: 55

          },    # OPTIONAL
          OidcMemberDefinition => {
            Groups => [
              'MyGroup', ...    # min: 1, max: 63
            ],    # min: 1, max: 10; OPTIONAL
          },    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],
      WorkteamName              => 'MyWorkteamName',
      NotificationConfiguration => {
        NotificationTopicArn => 'MyNotificationTopicArn',    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      WorkerAccessConfiguration => {
        S3Presign => {
          IamPolicyConstraints => {
            SourceIp    => 'Enabled',    # values: Enabled, Disabled; OPTIONAL

    );

    # Results:
    my $WorkteamArn = $CreateWorkteamResponse->WorkteamArn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::CreateWorkteamResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A description of the work team.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MemberDefinitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::MemberDefinition>]

A list of C<MemberDefinition> objects that contains objects that
identify the workers that make up the work team.

Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC
Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon
Cognito use C<CognitoMemberDefinition>. For workforces created using
your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use C<OidcMemberDefinition>. Do
not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request.

For workforces created using Amazon Cognito, private work teams
correspond to Amazon Cognito I<user groups> within the user pool used
to create a workforce. All of the C<CognitoMemberDefinition> objects
that make up the member definition must have the same C<ClientId> and
C<UserPool> values. To add a Amazon Cognito user group to an existing
worker pool, see Adding groups to a User Pool. For more information
about user pools, see Amazon Cognito User Pools
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html).

For workforces created using your own OIDC IdP, specify the user groups
that you want to include in your private work team in
C<OidcMemberDefinition> by listing those groups in C<Groups>.



=head2 NotificationConfiguration => L<Paws::SageMaker::NotificationConfiguration>

Configures notification of workers regarding available or expiring work
items.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::Tag>]

An array of key-value pairs.

For more information, see Resource Tag
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
and Using Cost Allocation Tags
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html#allocation-what)
in the I< Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide>.



=head2 WorkerAccessConfiguration => L<Paws::SageMaker::WorkerAccessConfiguration>

Use this optional parameter to constrain access to an Amazon S3
resource based on the IP address using supported IAM global condition
keys. The Amazon S3 resource is accessed in the worker portal using a
Amazon S3 presigned URL.



=head2 WorkforceName => Str

The name of the workforce.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkteamName => Str

The name of the work team. Use this name to identify the work team.
