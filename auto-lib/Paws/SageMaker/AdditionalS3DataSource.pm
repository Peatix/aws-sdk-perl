=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalS3DataSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalS3DataSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompressionType => $value, ..., S3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalS3DataSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompressionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A data source used for training or inference that is in addition to the
input dataset or model data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompressionType => Str

The type of compression used for an additional data source used in
inference or training. Specify C<None> if your additional data source
is not compressed.


=head2 ETag => Str

The ETag associated with S3 URI.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3DataType => Str

The data type of the additional data source that you specify for use in
inference or training.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The uniform resource identifier (URI) used to identify an additional
data source used in inference or training.
