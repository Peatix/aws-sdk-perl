=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricSpecification => $value, ..., TargetValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricSpecification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A target tracking scaling policy. Includes support for predefined or
customized metrics.

When using the PutScalingPolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_PutScalingPolicy.html)
API, this parameter is required when you are creating a policy with the
policy type C<TargetTrackingScaling>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricSpecification => L<Paws::SageMaker::MetricSpecification>

An object containing information about a metric.


=head2 TargetValue => Num

The recommended target value to specify for the metric when creating a
scaling policy.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
