=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::BatchTransformInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::BatchTransformInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataCapturedDestinationS3Uri => $value, ..., StartTimeOffset => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::BatchTransformInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataCapturedDestinationS3Uri

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Input object for the batch transform job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataCapturedDestinationS3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 location being used to capture the data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetFormat => L<Paws::SageMaker::MonitoringDatasetFormat>

The dataset format for your batch transform job.


=head2 EndTimeOffset => Str

If specified, monitoring jobs subtract this time from the end time. For
information about using offsets for scheduling monitoring jobs, see
Schedule Model Quality Monitoring Jobs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-model-quality-schedule.html).


=head2 ExcludeFeaturesAttribute => Str

The attributes of the input data to exclude from the analysis.


=head2 FeaturesAttribute => Str

The attributes of the input data that are the input features.


=head2 InferenceAttribute => Str

The attribute of the input data that represents the ground truth label.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LocalPath => Str

Path to the filesystem where the batch transform data is available to
the container.


=head2 ProbabilityAttribute => Str

In a classification problem, the attribute that represents the class
probability.


=head2 ProbabilityThresholdAttribute => Num

The threshold for the class probability to be evaluated as a positive
result.


=head2 S3DataDistributionType => Str

Whether input data distributed in Amazon S3 is fully replicated or
sharded by an S3 key. Defaults to C<FullyReplicated>


=head2 S3InputMode => Str

Whether the C<Pipe> or C<File> is used as the input mode for
transferring data for the monitoring job. C<Pipe> mode is recommended
for large datasets. C<File> mode is useful for small files that fit in
memory. Defaults to C<File>.


=head2 StartTimeOffset => Str

If specified, monitoring jobs substract this time from the start time.
For information about using offsets for scheduling monitoring jobs, see
Schedule Model Quality Monitoring Jobs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor-model-quality-schedule.html).
