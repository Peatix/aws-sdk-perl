=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentSpecificationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentSpecificationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseInferenceComponentName => $value, ..., StartupParameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentSpecificationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseInferenceComponentName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about the resources that are deployed with this inference
component.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaseInferenceComponentName => Str

The name of the base inference component that contains this inference
component.


=head2 ComputeResourceRequirements => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentComputeResourceRequirements>

The compute resources allocated to run the model, plus any adapter
models, that you assign to the inference component.


=head2 Container => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentContainerSpecificationSummary>

Details about the container that provides the runtime environment for
the model that is deployed with the inference component.


=head2 ModelName => Str

The name of the SageMaker AI model object that is deployed with the
inference component.


=head2 StartupParameters => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentStartupParameters>

Settings that take effect while the model container starts up.



=head1 SEE ALSO
