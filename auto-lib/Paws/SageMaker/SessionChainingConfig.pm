=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::SessionChainingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::SessionChainingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableSessionTagChaining => $value, ..., EnableSessionTagChaining => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::SessionChainingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableSessionTagChaining

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about attribute-based access control (ABAC) for a
training job. The session chaining configuration uses Amazon Security
Token Service (STS) for your training job to request temporary,
limited-privilege credentials to tenants. For more information, see
Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for multi-tenancy training
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-access-training-data.html#model-access-training-data-abac).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnableSessionTagChaining => Bool

Set to C<True> to allow SageMaker to extract session tags from a
training job creation role and reuse these tags when assuming the
training job execution role.
