=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::SchedulerConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::SchedulerConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FairShare => $value, ..., PriorityClasses => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::SchedulerConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FairShare

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cluster policy configuration. This policy is used for task
prioritization and fair-share allocation. This helps prioritize
critical workloads and distributes idle compute across entities.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FairShare => Str

When enabled, entities borrow idle compute based on their assigned
C<FairShareWeight>.

When disabled, entities borrow idle compute based on a first-come
first-serve basis.

Default is C<Enabled>.


=head2 PriorityClasses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::PriorityClass>]

List of the priority classes, C<PriorityClass>, of the cluster policy.
When specified, these class configurations define how tasks are queued.
