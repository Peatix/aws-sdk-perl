=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CurrentInstanceCount => $value, ..., VariantStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CurrentInstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes weight and capacities for a production variant associated
with an endpoint. If you sent a request to the
C<UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities> API and the endpoint status is
C<Updating>, you get different desired and current values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CurrentInstanceCount => Int

The number of instances associated with the variant.


=head2 CurrentServerlessConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantServerlessConfig>

The serverless configuration for the endpoint.


=head2 CurrentWeight => Num

The weight associated with the variant.


=head2 DeployedImages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::DeployedImage>]

An array of C<DeployedImage> objects that specify the Amazon EC2
Container Registry paths of the inference images deployed on instances
of this C<ProductionVariant>.


=head2 DesiredInstanceCount => Int

The number of instances requested in the
C<UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities> request.


=head2 DesiredServerlessConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantServerlessConfig>

The serverless configuration requested for the endpoint update.


=head2 DesiredWeight => Num

The requested weight, as specified in the
C<UpdateEndpointWeightsAndCapacities> request.


=head2 ManagedInstanceScaling => L<Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantManagedInstanceScaling>

Settings that control the range in the number of instances that the
endpoint provisions as it scales up or down to accommodate traffic.


=head2 RoutingConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantRoutingConfig>

Settings that control how the endpoint routes incoming traffic to the
instances that the endpoint hosts.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VariantName => Str

The name of the variant.


=head2 VariantStatus => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ProductionVariantStatus>]

The endpoint variant status which describes the current deployment
stage status or operational status.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
