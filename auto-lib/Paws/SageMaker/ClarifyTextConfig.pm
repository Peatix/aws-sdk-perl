=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyTextConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyTextConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Granularity => $value, ..., Language => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyTextConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Granularity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A parameter used to configure the SageMaker Clarify explainer to treat
text features as text so that explanations are provided for individual
units of text. Required only for natural language processing (NLP)
explainability.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Granularity => Str

The unit of granularity for the analysis of text features. For example,
if the unit is C<'token'>, then each token (like a word in English) of
the text is treated as a feature. SHAP values are computed for each
unit/feature.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Language => Str

Specifies the language of the text features in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-3
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) code of a supported language.

For a mix of multiple languages, use code C<'xx'>.
