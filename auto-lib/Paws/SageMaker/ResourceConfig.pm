=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceCount => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ResourceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the resources, including machine learning (ML) compute
instances and ML storage volumes, to use for model training.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstanceCount => Int

The number of ML compute instances to use. For distributed training,
provide a value greater than 1.


=head2 InstanceGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::InstanceGroup>]

The configuration of a heterogeneous cluster in JSON format.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The ML compute instance type.

SageMaker Training on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) P4de instances
is in preview release starting December 9th, 2022.

Amazon EC2 P4de instances
(http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p4/) (currently in preview)
are powered by 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 80GB high-performance HBM2e GPU
memory, which accelerate the speed of training ML models that need to
be trained on large datasets of high-resolution data. In this preview
release, Amazon SageMaker supports ML training jobs on P4de instances
(C<ml.p4de.24xlarge>) to reduce model training time. The
C<ml.p4de.24xlarge> instances are available in the following Amazon Web
Services Regions.

=over

=item *

US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

=item *

US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

=back

To request quota limit increase and start using P4de instances, contact
the SageMaker Training service team through your account team.


=head2 KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds => Int

The duration of time in seconds to retain configured resources in a
warm pool for subsequent training jobs.


=head2 TrainingPlanArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN); of the training plan to use for this
resource configuration.


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key that SageMaker uses to encrypt data on
the storage volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the
training job.

Certain Nitro-based instances include local storage, dependent on the
instance type. Local storage volumes are encrypted using a hardware
module on the instance. You can't request a C<VolumeKmsKeyId> when
using an instance type with local storage.

For a list of instance types that support local instance storage, see
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#instance-store-volumes).

For more information about local instance storage encryption, see SSD
Instance Store Volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html).

The C<VolumeKmsKeyId> can be in any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The size of the ML storage volume that you want to provision.

ML storage volumes store model artifacts and incremental states.
Training algorithms might also use the ML storage volume for scratch
space. If you want to store the training data in the ML storage volume,
choose C<File> as the C<TrainingInputMode> in the algorithm
specification.

When using an ML instance with NVMe SSD volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html#nvme-ssd-volumes),
SageMaker doesn't provision Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2)
storage. Available storage is fixed to the NVMe-type instance's storage
capacity. SageMaker configures storage paths for training datasets,
checkpoints, model artifacts, and outputs to use the entire capacity of
the instance storage. For example, ML instance families with the
NVMe-type instance storage include C<ml.p4d>, C<ml.g4dn>, and C<ml.g5>.

When using an ML instance with the EBS-only storage option and without
instance storage, you must define the size of EBS volume through
C<VolumeSizeInGB> in the C<ResourceConfig> API. For example, ML
instance families that use EBS volumes include C<ml.c5> and C<ml.p2>.

To look up instance types and their instance storage types and volumes,
see Amazon EC2 Instance Types
(http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

To find the default local paths defined by the SageMaker training
platform, see Amazon SageMaker Training Storage Folders for Training
Datasets, Checkpoints, Model Artifacts, and Outputs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-train-storage.html).
