=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::OutputDataConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::OutputDataConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompressionType => $value, ..., S3OutputPath => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::OutputDataConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompressionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about how to store model training results (model
artifacts).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompressionType => Str

The model output compression type. Select C<None> to output an
uncompressed model, recommended for large model outputs. Defaults to
gzip.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
KMS) key that SageMaker uses to encrypt the model artifacts at rest
using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. The C<KmsKeyId> can be any of
the following formats:

=over

=item *

// KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

// KMS Key Alias

C<"alias/ExampleAlias">

=item *

// Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key Alias

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias">

=back

If you use a KMS key ID or an alias of your KMS key, the SageMaker
execution role must include permissions to call C<kms:Encrypt>. If you
don't provide a KMS key ID, SageMaker uses the default KMS key for
Amazon S3 for your role's account. For more information, see
KMS-Managed Encryption Keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingKMSEncryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide>. If the output
data is stored in Amazon S3 Express One Zone, it is encrypted with
server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). KMS key is
not supported for Amazon S3 Express One Zone

The KMS key policy must grant permission to the IAM role that you
specify in your C<CreateTrainingJob>, C<CreateTransformJob>, or
C<CreateHyperParameterTuningJob> requests. For more information, see
Using Key Policies in Amazon Web Services KMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3OutputPath => Str

Identifies the S3 path where you want SageMaker to store the model
artifacts. For example, C<s3://bucket-name/key-name-prefix>.
