=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::DescribePipelineExecution - Arguments for method DescribePipelineExecution on L<Paws::SageMaker>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribePipelineExecution on the
L<Amazon SageMaker Service|Paws::SageMaker> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribePipelineExecution.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribePipelineExecution.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse =
      $api . sagemaker->DescribePipelineExecution(
      PipelineExecutionArn => 'MyPipelineExecutionArn',

      );

    # Results:
    my $CreatedBy        = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->CreatedBy;
    my $CreationTime     = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->CreationTime;
    my $FailureReason    = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->FailureReason;
    my $LastModifiedBy   = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->LastModifiedBy;
    my $LastModifiedTime = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->LastModifiedTime;
    my $ParallelismConfiguration =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->ParallelismConfiguration;
    my $PipelineArn = $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineArn;
    my $PipelineExecutionArn =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineExecutionArn;
    my $PipelineExecutionDescription =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineExecutionDescription;
    my $PipelineExecutionDisplayName =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineExecutionDisplayName;
    my $PipelineExecutionStatus =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineExecutionStatus;
    my $PipelineExperimentConfig =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->PipelineExperimentConfig;
    my $SelectiveExecutionConfig =
      $DescribePipelineExecutionResponse->SelectiveExecutionConfig;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::DescribePipelineExecutionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/api.sagemaker/DescribePipelineExecution>
