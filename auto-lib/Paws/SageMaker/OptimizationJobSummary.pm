=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., OptimizationTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::OptimizationJobSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summarizes an optimization job by providing some of its key properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The time when you created the optimization job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentInstanceType => Str

The type of instance that hosts the optimized model that you create
with the optimization job.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The time when the optimization job was last updated.


=head2 OptimizationEndTime => Str

The time when the optimization job finished processing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OptimizationJobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the optimization job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OptimizationJobName => Str

The name that you assigned to the optimization job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OptimizationJobStatus => Str

The current status of the optimization job.


=head2 OptimizationStartTime => Str

The time when the optimization job started.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OptimizationTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The optimization techniques that are applied by the optimization job.
