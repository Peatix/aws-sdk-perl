=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of resources, including compute instances and storage
volumes for use in training jobs launched by hyperparameter tuning
jobs. C<HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig> is similar to
C<ResourceConfig>, but has the additional C<InstanceConfigs> and
C<AllocationStrategy> fields to allow for flexible instance management.
Specify one or more instance types, count, and the allocation strategy
for instance selection.

C<HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig> supports the capabilities of
C<ResourceConfig> with the exception of C<KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds>.
Hyperparameter tuning jobs use warm pools by default, which reuse
clusters between training jobs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

The strategy that determines the order of preference for resources
specified in C<InstanceConfigs> used in hyperparameter optimization.


=head2 InstanceConfigs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningInstanceConfig>]

A list containing the configuration(s) for one or more resources for
processing hyperparameter jobs. These resources include compute
instances and storage volumes to use in model training jobs launched by
hyperparameter tuning jobs. The C<AllocationStrategy> controls the
order in which multiple configurations provided in C<InstanceConfigs>
are used.

If you only want to use a single instance configuration inside the
C<HyperParameterTuningResourceConfig> API, do not provide a value for
C<InstanceConfigs>. Instead, use C<InstanceType>, C<VolumeSizeInGB> and
C<InstanceCount>. If you use C<InstanceConfigs>, do not provide values
for C<InstanceType>, C<VolumeSizeInGB> or C<InstanceCount>.


=head2 InstanceCount => Int

The number of compute instances of type C<InstanceType> to use. For
distributed training
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel-use-api.html),
select a value greater than 1.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type used to run hyperparameter optimization tuning jobs.
See descriptions of instance types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-available-instance-types.html)
for more information.


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

A key used by Amazon Web Services Key Management Service to encrypt
data on the storage volume attached to the compute instances used to
run the training job. You can use either of the following formats to
specify a key.

KMS Key ID:

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS key:

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

Some instances use local storage, which use a hardware module to
encrypt
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssd-instance-store.html)
storage volumes. If you choose one of these instance types, you cannot
request a C<VolumeKmsKeyId>. For a list of instance types that use
local storage, see instance store volumes
(http://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/host-instance-storage-volumes-table/).
For more information about Amazon Web Services Key Management Service,
see KMS encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-security-kms-permissions.html)
for more information.


=head2 VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The volume size in GB for the storage volume to be used in processing
hyperparameter optimization jobs (optional). These volumes store model
artifacts, incremental states and optionally, scratch space for
training algorithms. Do not provide a value for this parameter if a
value for C<InstanceConfigs> is also specified.

Some instance types have a fixed total local storage size. If you
select one of these instances for training, C<VolumeSizeInGB> cannot be
greater than this total size. For a list of instance types with local
instance storage and their sizes, see instance store volumes
(http://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/host-instance-storage-volumes-table/).

SageMaker supports only the General Purpose SSD (gp2)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volume-types.html)
storage volume type.
