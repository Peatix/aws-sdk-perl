=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TuningJobCompletionCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TuningJobCompletionCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BestObjectiveNotImproving => $value, ..., TargetObjectiveMetricValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TuningJobCompletionCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BestObjectiveNotImproving

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The job completion criteria.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BestObjectiveNotImproving => L<Paws::SageMaker::BestObjectiveNotImproving>

A flag to stop your hyperparameter tuning job if model performance
fails to improve as evaluated against an objective function.


=head2 ConvergenceDetected => L<Paws::SageMaker::ConvergenceDetected>

A flag to top your hyperparameter tuning job if automatic model tuning
(AMT) has detected that your model has converged as evaluated against
your objective function.


=head2 TargetObjectiveMetricValue => Num

The value of the objective metric.
