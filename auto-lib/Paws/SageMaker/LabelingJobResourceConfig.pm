=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::LabelingJobResourceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::LabelingJobResourceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { VolumeKmsKeyId => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::LabelingJobResourceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->VolumeKmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configure encryption on the storage volume attached to the ML compute
instance used to run automated data labeling model training and
inference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 VolumeKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services
KMS) key that Amazon SageMaker uses to encrypt data on the storage
volume attached to the ML compute instance(s) that run the training and
inference jobs used for automated data labeling.

You can only specify a C<VolumeKmsKeyId> when you create a labeling job
with automated data labeling enabled using the API operation
C<CreateLabelingJob>. You cannot specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key
to encrypt the storage volume used for automated data labeling model
training and inference when you create a labeling job using the
console. To learn more, see Output Data and Storage Volume Encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-security.html).

The C<VolumeKmsKeyId> can be any of the following formats:

=over

=item *

KMS Key ID

C<"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">

=item *

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a KMS Key

C<"arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab">
