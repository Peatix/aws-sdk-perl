=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::WarmPoolStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::WarmPoolStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::WarmPoolStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Status and billing information about the warm pool.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds => Int

The billable time in seconds used by the warm pool. Billable time
refers to the absolute wall-clock time.

Multiply C<ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds> by the number of
instances (C<InstanceCount>) in your training cluster to get the total
compute time SageMaker bills you if you run warm pool training. The
formula is as follows: C<ResourceRetainedBillableTimeInSeconds *
InstanceCount>.


=head2 ReusedByJob => Str

The name of the matching training job that reused the warm pool.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of the warm pool.

=over

=item *

C<InUse>: The warm pool is in use for the training job.

=item *

C<Available>: The warm pool is available to reuse for a matching
training job.

=item *

C<Reused>: The warm pool moved to a matching training job for reuse.

=item *

C<Terminated>: The warm pool is no longer available. Warm pools are
unavailable if they are terminated by a user, terminated for a patch
update, or terminated for exceeding the specified
C<KeepAlivePeriodInSeconds>.
