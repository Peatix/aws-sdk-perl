=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeQuotaResources => $value, ..., ResourceSharingConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeQuotaResources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration of the compute allocation definition for an entity. This
includes the resource sharing option and the setting to preempt low
priority tasks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeQuotaResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaResourceConfig>]

Allocate compute resources by instance types.


=head2 PreemptTeamTasks => Str

Allows workloads from within an entity to preempt same-team workloads.
When set to C<LowerPriority>, the entity's lower priority tasks are
preempted by their own higher priority tasks.

Default is C<LowerPriority>.


=head2 ResourceSharingConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ResourceSharingConfig>

Resource sharing configuration. This defines how an entity can lend and
borrow idle compute with other entities within the cluster.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
