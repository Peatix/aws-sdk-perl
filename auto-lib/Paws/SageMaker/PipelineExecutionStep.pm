=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStep

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStep object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttemptCount => $value, ..., StepStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStep object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttemptCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An execution of a step in a pipeline.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttemptCount => Int

The current attempt of the execution step. For more information, see
Retry Policy for SageMaker Pipelines steps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-retry-policy.html).


=head2 CacheHitResult => L<Paws::SageMaker::CacheHitResult>

If this pipeline execution step was cached, details on the cache hit.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The time that the step stopped executing.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

The reason why the step failed execution. This is only returned if the
step failed its execution.


=head2 Metadata => L<Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStepMetadata>

Metadata to run the pipeline step.


=head2 SelectiveExecutionResult => L<Paws::SageMaker::SelectiveExecutionResult>

The ARN from an execution of the current pipeline from which results
are reused for this step.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The time that the step started executing.


=head2 StepDescription => Str

The description of the step.


=head2 StepDisplayName => Str

The display name of the step.


=head2 StepName => Str

The name of the step that is executed.


=head2 StepStatus => Str

The status of the step execution.
