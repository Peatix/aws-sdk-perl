=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NumberOfSamples => $value, ..., UseLogit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->NumberOfSamples

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for SHAP analysis using SageMaker Clarify Explainer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 NumberOfSamples => Int

The number of samples to be used for analysis by the Kernal SHAP
algorithm.

The number of samples determines the size of the synthetic dataset,
which has an impact on latency of explainability requests. For more
information, see the B<Synthetic data> of Configure and create an
endpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/clarify-online-explainability-create-endpoint.html).


=head2 Seed => Int

The starting value used to initialize the random number generator in
the explainer. Provide a value for this parameter to obtain a
deterministic SHAP result.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ShapBaselineConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyShapBaselineConfig>

The configuration for the SHAP baseline of the Kernal SHAP algorithm.


=head2 TextConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyTextConfig>

A parameter that indicates if text features are treated as text and
explanations are provided for individual units of text. Required for
natural language processing (NLP) explainability only.


=head2 UseLogit => Bool

A Boolean toggle to indicate if you want to use the logit function
(true) or log-odds units (false) for model predictions. Defaults to
false.
