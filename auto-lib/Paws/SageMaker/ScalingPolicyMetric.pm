=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ScalingPolicyMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ScalingPolicyMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InvocationsPerInstance => $value, ..., ModelLatency => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ScalingPolicyMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InvocationsPerInstance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metric for a scaling policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InvocationsPerInstance => Int

The number of invocations sent to a model, normalized by
C<InstanceCount> in each ProductionVariant. C<1/numberOfInstances> is
sent as the value on each request, where C<numberOfInstances> is the
number of active instances for the ProductionVariant behind the
endpoint at the time of the request.


=head2 ModelLatency => Int

The interval of time taken by a model to respond as viewed from
SageMaker. This interval includes the local communication times taken
to send the request and to fetch the response from the container of a
model and the time taken to complete the inference in the container.
