=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds => $value, ..., MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

How long a job is allowed to run, or how many candidates a job is
allowed to generate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxAutoMLJobRuntimeInSeconds => Int

The maximum runtime, in seconds, an AutoML job has to complete.

If an AutoML job exceeds the maximum runtime, the job is stopped
automatically and its processing is ended gracefully. The AutoML job
identifies the best model whose training was completed and marks it as
the best-performing model. Any unfinished steps of the job, such as
automatic one-click Autopilot model deployment, are not completed.


=head2 MaxCandidates => Int

The maximum number of times a training job is allowed to run.

For text and image classification, time-series forecasting, as well as
text generation (LLMs fine-tuning) problem types, the supported value
is 1. For tabular problem types, the maximum value is 750.


=head2 MaxRuntimePerTrainingJobInSeconds => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that each training job executed inside
hyperparameter tuning is allowed to run as part of a hyperparameter
tuning job. For more information, see the StoppingCondition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_StoppingCondition.html)
used by the CreateHyperParameterTuningJob
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateHyperParameterTuningJob.html)
action.

For job V2s (jobs created by calling C<CreateAutoMLJobV2>), this field
controls the runtime of the job candidate.

For TextGenerationJobConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_TextClassificationJobConfig.html)
problem types, the maximum time defaults to 72 hours (259200 seconds).
