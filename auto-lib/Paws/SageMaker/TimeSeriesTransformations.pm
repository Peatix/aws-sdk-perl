=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesTransformations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesTransformations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Aggregation => $value, ..., Filling => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesTransformations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Aggregation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Transformations allowed on the dataset. Supported transformations are
C<Filling> and C<Aggregation>. C<Filling> specifies how to add values
to missing values in the dataset. C<Aggregation> defines how to
aggregate data that does not align with forecast frequency.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Aggregation => L<Paws::SageMaker::AggregationTransformations>

A key value pair defining the aggregation method for a column, where
the key is the column name and the value is the aggregation method.

The supported aggregation methods are C<sum> (default), C<avg>,
C<first>, C<min>, C<max>.

Aggregation is only supported for the target column.


=head2 Filling => L<Paws::SageMaker::FillingTransformations>

A key value pair defining the filling method for a column, where the
key is the column name and the value is an object which defines the
filling logic. You can specify multiple filling methods for a single
column.

The supported filling methods and their corresponding options are:

=over

=item *

C<frontfill>: C<none> (Supported only for target column)

=item *

C<middlefill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<backfill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=item *

C<futurefill>: C<zero>, C<value>, C<median>, C<mean>, C<min>, C<max>

=back

To set a filling method to a specific value, set the fill parameter to
the chosen filling method value (for example C<"backfill" : "value">),
and define the filling value in an additional parameter prefixed with
"_value". For example, to set C<backfill> to a value of C<2>, you must
include two parameters: C<"backfill": "value"> and
C<"backfill_value":"2">.
