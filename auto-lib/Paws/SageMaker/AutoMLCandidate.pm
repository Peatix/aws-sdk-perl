=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLCandidate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLCandidate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CandidateName => $value, ..., ObjectiveStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLCandidate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CandidateName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a candidate produced by an AutoML training job,
including its status, steps, and other properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CandidateName => Str

The name of the candidate.


=head2 CandidateProperties => L<Paws::SageMaker::CandidateProperties>

The properties of an AutoML candidate job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CandidateStatus => Str

The candidate's status.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CandidateSteps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLCandidateStep>]

Information about the candidate's steps.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The creation time.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The end time.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

The failure reason.


=head2 FinalAutoMLJobObjectiveMetric => L<Paws::SageMaker::FinalAutoMLJobObjectiveMetric>




=head2 InferenceContainerDefinitions => L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLInferenceContainerDefinitions>

The mapping of all supported processing unit (CPU, GPU, etc...) to
inference container definitions for the candidate. This field is
populated for the AutoML jobs V2 (for example, for jobs created by
calling C<CreateAutoMLJobV2>) related to image or text classification
problem types only.


=head2 InferenceContainers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLContainerDefinition>]

Information about the recommended inference container definitions.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastModifiedTime => Str

The last modified time.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ObjectiveStatus => Str

The objective's status.
