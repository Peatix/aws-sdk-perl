=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ClusterLifeCycleConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ClusterLifeCycleConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OnCreate => $value, ..., SourceS3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ClusterLifeCycleConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OnCreate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The lifecycle configuration for a SageMaker HyperPod cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OnCreate => Str

The file name of the entrypoint script of lifecycle scripts under
C<SourceS3Uri>. This entrypoint script runs during cluster creation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceS3Uri => Str

An Amazon S3 bucket path where your lifecycle scripts are stored.

Make sure that the S3 bucket path starts with C<s3://sagemaker->. The
IAM role for SageMaker HyperPod
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites.html#sagemaker-hyperpod-prerequisites-iam-role-for-hyperpod)
has the managed C<AmazonSageMakerClusterInstanceRolePolicy>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/security-iam-awsmanpol-cluster.html)
attached, which allows access to S3 buckets with the specific prefix
C<sagemaker->.
