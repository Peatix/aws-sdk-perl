=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLProblemTypeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLProblemTypeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImageClassificationJobConfig => $value, ..., TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLProblemTypeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImageClassificationJobConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of settings specific to the problem type used to configure
an AutoML job V2. There must be one and only one config of the
following type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ImageClassificationJobConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ImageClassificationJobConfig>

Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the image
classification problem type.


=head2 TabularJobConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::TabularJobConfig>

Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the tabular problem
type (regression, classification).


=head2 TextClassificationJobConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::TextClassificationJobConfig>

Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the text classification
problem type.


=head2 TextGenerationJobConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::TextGenerationJobConfig>

Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the text generation
(LLMs fine-tuning) problem type.

The text generation models that support fine-tuning in Autopilot are
currently accessible exclusively in regions supported by Canvas. Refer
to the documentation of Canvas for the full list of its supported
Regions (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/canvas.html).


=head2 TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig>

Settings used to configure an AutoML job V2 for the time-series
forecasting problem type.
