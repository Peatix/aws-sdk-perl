=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits => $value, ..., ThroughputMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The new throughput configuration for the feature group. You can switch
between on-demand and provisioned modes or update the read / write
capacity of provisioned feature groups. You can switch a feature group
to on-demand only once in a 24 hour period.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits => Int

For provisioned feature groups with online store enabled, this
indicates the read throughput you are billed for and can consume
without throttling.


=head2 ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits => Int

For provisioned feature groups, this indicates the write throughput you
are billed for and can consume without throttling.


=head2 ThroughputMode => Str

Target throughput mode of the feature group. Throughput update is an
asynchronous operation, and the outcome should be monitored by polling
C<LastUpdateStatus> field in C<DescribeFeatureGroup> response. You
cannot update a feature group's throughput while another update is in
progress.
