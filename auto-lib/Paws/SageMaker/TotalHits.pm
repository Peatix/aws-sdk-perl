=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TotalHits

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TotalHits object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Relation => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TotalHits object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Relation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the total number of matching results and indicates how
accurate that count is.

The C<Value> field provides the count, which may be exact or estimated.
The C<Relation> field indicates whether it's an exact figure or a lower
bound. This helps understand the full scope of search results,
especially when dealing with large result sets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Relation => Str

Indicates the relationship between the returned C<Value> and the actual
total number of matching results. Possible values are:

=over

=item *

C<EqualTo>: The C<Value> is the exact count of matching results.

=item *

C<GreaterThanOrEqualTo>: The C<Value> is a lower bound of the actual
count of matching results.

=back



=head2 Value => Int

The total number of matching results. This value may be exact or an
estimate, depending on the C<Relation> field.
