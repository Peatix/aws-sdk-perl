=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalInferenceSpecificationDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalInferenceSpecificationDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Containers => $value, ..., SupportedTransformInstanceTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalInferenceSpecificationDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Containers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure of additional Inference Specification. Additional Inference
Specification specifies details about inference jobs that can be run
with models based on this model package

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Containers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageContainerDefinition>]

The Amazon ECR registry path of the Docker image that contains the
inference code.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the additional Inference specification


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A unique name to identify the additional inference specification. The
name must be unique within the list of your additional inference
specifications for a particular model package.


=head2 SupportedContentTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The supported MIME types for the input data.


=head2 SupportedRealtimeInferenceInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the instance types that are used to generate inferences in
real-time.


=head2 SupportedResponseMIMETypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The supported MIME types for the output data.


=head2 SupportedTransformInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the instance types on which a transformation job can be run
or on which an endpoint can be deployed.



=head1 SEE ALSO
