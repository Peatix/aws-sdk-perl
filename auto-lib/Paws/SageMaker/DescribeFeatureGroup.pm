=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::DescribeFeatureGroup - Arguments for method DescribeFeatureGroup on L<Paws::SageMaker>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeFeatureGroup on the
L<Amazon SageMaker Service|Paws::SageMaker> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeFeatureGroup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeFeatureGroup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse = $api . sagemaker->DescribeFeatureGroup(
      FeatureGroupName => 'MyFeatureGroupNameOrArn',
      NextToken        => 'MyNextToken',               # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CreationTime = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->CreationTime;
    my $Description  = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->Description;
    my $EventTimeFeatureName =
      $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->EventTimeFeatureName;
    my $FailureReason      = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->FailureReason;
    my $FeatureDefinitions = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->FeatureDefinitions;
    my $FeatureGroupArn    = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->FeatureGroupArn;
    my $FeatureGroupName   = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->FeatureGroupName;
    my $FeatureGroupStatus = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->FeatureGroupStatus;
    my $LastModifiedTime   = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->LastModifiedTime;
    my $LastUpdateStatus   = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->LastUpdateStatus;
    my $NextToken          = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->NextToken;
    my $OfflineStoreConfig = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->OfflineStoreConfig;
    my $OfflineStoreStatus = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->OfflineStoreStatus;
    my $OnlineStoreConfig  = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->OnlineStoreConfig;
    my $OnlineStoreTotalSizeBytes =
      $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->OnlineStoreTotalSizeBytes;
    my $RecordIdentifierFeatureName =
      $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->RecordIdentifierFeatureName;
    my $RoleArn          = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->RoleArn;
    my $ThroughputConfig = $DescribeFeatureGroupResponse->ThroughputConfig;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::DescribeFeatureGroupResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
