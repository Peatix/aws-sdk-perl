=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningInstanceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningInstanceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceCount => $value, ..., VolumeSizeInGB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningInstanceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for hyperparameter tuning resources for use in
training jobs launched by the tuning job. These resources include
compute instances and storage volumes. Specify one or more compute
instance configurations and allocation strategies to select resources
(optional).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceCount => Int

The number of instances of the type specified by C<InstanceType>.
Choose an instance count larger than 1 for distributed training
algorithms. See Step 2: Launch a SageMaker Distributed Training Job
Using the SageMaker Python SDK
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/data-parallel-use-api.html)
for more information.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The instance type used for processing of hyperparameter optimization
jobs. Choose from general purpose (no GPUs) instance types:
ml.m5.xlarge, ml.m5.2xlarge, and ml.m5.4xlarge or compute optimized (no
GPUs) instance types: ml.c5.xlarge and ml.c5.2xlarge. For more
information about instance types, see instance type descriptions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-available-instance-types.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeSizeInGB => Int

The volume size in GB of the data to be processed for hyperparameter
optimization (optional).
