=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientConfig => $value, ..., OutputConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies configuration for how an endpoint performs asynchronous
inference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceClientConfig>

Configures the behavior of the client used by SageMaker to interact
with the model container during asynchronous inference.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::AsyncInferenceOutputConfig>

Specifies the configuration for asynchronous inference invocation
outputs.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
