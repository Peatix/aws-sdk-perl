=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLComputeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLComputeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EmrServerlessComputeConfig => $value, ..., EmrServerlessComputeConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLComputeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EmrServerlessComputeConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is intended for use exclusively by SageMaker Canvas and
cannot be used in other contexts at the moment.

Specifies the compute configuration for an AutoML job V2.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EmrServerlessComputeConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::EmrServerlessComputeConfig>

The configuration for using EMR Serverless
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/emr-serverless.html)
to run the AutoML job V2.

To allow your AutoML job V2 to automatically initiate a remote job on
EMR Serverless when additional compute resources are needed to process
large datasets, you need to provide an C<EmrServerlessComputeConfig>
object, which includes an C<ExecutionRoleARN> attribute, to the
C<AutoMLComputeConfig> of the AutoML job V2 input request.

By seamlessly transitioning to EMR Serverless when required, the AutoML
job can handle datasets that would otherwise exceed the initially
provisioned resources, without any manual intervention from you.

EMR Serverless is available for the tabular and time series problem
types. We recommend setting up this option for tabular datasets larger
than 5 GB and time series datasets larger than 30 GB.
