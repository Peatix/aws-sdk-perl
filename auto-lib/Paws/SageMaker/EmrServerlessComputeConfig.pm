=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::EmrServerlessComputeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::EmrServerlessComputeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExecutionRoleARN => $value, ..., ExecutionRoleARN => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::EmrServerlessComputeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExecutionRoleARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is intended for use exclusively by SageMaker Canvas and
cannot be used in other contexts at the moment.

Specifies the compute configuration for the EMR Serverless job.
