=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLChannel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLChannel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelType => $value, ..., TargetAttributeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLChannel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A channel is a named input source that training algorithms can consume.
The validation dataset size is limited to less than 2 GB. The training
dataset size must be less than 100 GB. For more information, see
Channel
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_Channel.html).

A validation dataset must contain the same headers as the training
dataset.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelType => Str

The channel type (optional) is an C<enum> string. The default value is
C<training>. Channels for training and validation must share the same
C<ContentType> and C<TargetAttributeName>. For information on
specifying training and validation channel types, see How to specify
training and validation datasets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-datasets-problem-types.html#autopilot-data-sources-training-or-validation).


=head2 CompressionType => Str

You can use C<Gzip> or C<None>. The default value is C<None>.


=head2 ContentType => Str

The content type of the data from the input source. You can use
C<text/csv;header=present> or C<x-application/vnd.amazon+parquet>. The
default value is C<text/csv;header=present>.


=head2 DataSource => L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLDataSource>

The data source for an AutoML channel.


=head2 SampleWeightAttributeName => Str

If specified, this column name indicates which column of the dataset
should be treated as sample weights for use by the objective metric
during the training, evaluation, and the selection of the best model.
This column is not considered as a predictive feature. For more
information on Autopilot metrics, see Metrics and validation
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-metrics-validation.html).

Sample weights should be numeric, non-negative, with larger values
indicating which rows are more important than others. Data points that
have invalid or no weight value are excluded.

Support for sample weights is available in Ensembling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLAlgorithmConfig.html)
mode only.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetAttributeName => Str

The name of the target variable in supervised learning, usually
represented by 'y'.
