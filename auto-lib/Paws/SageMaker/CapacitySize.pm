=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::CapacitySize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the type and size of the endpoint capacity to activate for a
blue/green deployment, a rolling deployment, or a rollback strategy.
You can specify your batches as either instance count or the overall
percentage or your fleet.

For a rollback strategy, if you don't specify the fields in this
object, or if you set the C<Value> to 100%, then SageMaker uses a
blue/green rollback strategy and rolls all traffic back to the blue
fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

instances.

C<CAPACITY_PERCENT>: The endpoint activates based on the specified
percentage of capacity.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Int
