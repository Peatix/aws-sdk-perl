=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLDataSplitConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLDataSplitConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ValidationFraction => $value, ..., ValidationFraction => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLDataSplitConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ValidationFraction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure specifies how to split the data into train and
validation datasets.

The validation and training datasets must contain the same headers. For
jobs created by calling C<CreateAutoMLJob>, the validation dataset must
be less than 2 GB in size.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ValidationFraction => Num

The validation fraction (optional) is a float that specifies the
portion of the training dataset to be used for validation. The default
value is 0.2, and values must be greater than 0 and less than 1. We
recommend setting this value to be less than 0.5.
