=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentCapacitySize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentCapacitySize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::InferenceComponentCapacitySize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the type and size of the endpoint capacity to activate for a
rolling deployment or a rollback strategy. You can specify your batches
as either of the following:

=over

=item *

A count of inference component copies

=item *

The overall percentage or your fleet

=back

For a rollback strategy, if you don't specify the fields in this
object, or if you set the C<Value> parameter to 100%, then SageMaker AI
uses a blue/green rollback strategy and rolls all traffic back to the
blue fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

Specifies the endpoint capacity type.

=over

=item COPY_COUNT

The endpoint activates based on the number of inference component
copies.

=item CAPACITY_PERCENT

The endpoint activates based on the specified percentage of capacity.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Int

Defines the capacity size, either as a number of inference component
copies or a capacity percentage.
