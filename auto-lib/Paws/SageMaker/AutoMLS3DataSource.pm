=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLS3DataSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLS3DataSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { S3DataType => $value, ..., S3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLS3DataSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->S3DataType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the Amazon S3 data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3DataType => Str

The data type.

=over

=item *

If you choose C<S3Prefix>, C<S3Uri> identifies a key name prefix.
SageMaker AI uses all objects that match the specified key name prefix
for model training.

The C<S3Prefix> should have the following format:

C<s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER-OR-FILE>

=item *

If you choose C<ManifestFile>, C<S3Uri> identifies an object that is a
manifest file containing a list of object keys that you want SageMaker
AI to use for model training.

A C<ManifestFile> should have the format shown below:

C<[ {"prefix":
"s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DOC-EXAMPLE-PREFIX/"},>

C<"DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-1",>

C<"DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-2",>

C<... "DOC-EXAMPLE-RELATIVE-PATH/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/DATA-N" ]>

=item *

If you choose C<AugmentedManifestFile>, C<S3Uri> identifies an object
that is an augmented manifest file in JSON lines format. This file
contains the data you want to use for model training.
C<AugmentedManifestFile> is available for V2 API jobs only (for
example, for jobs created by calling C<CreateAutoMLJobV2>).

Here is a minimal, single-record example of an
C<AugmentedManifestFile>:

C<{"source-ref":
"s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/DOC-EXAMPLE-FOLDER/cats/cat.jpg",>

C<"label-metadata": {"class-name": "cat"> }

For more information on C<AugmentedManifestFile>, see Provide Dataset
Metadata to Training Jobs with an Augmented Manifest File
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/augmented-manifest.html).

=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The URL to the Amazon S3 data source. The Uri refers to the Amazon S3
prefix or ManifestFile depending on the data type.
