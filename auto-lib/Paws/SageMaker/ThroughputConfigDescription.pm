=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits => $value, ..., ThroughputMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ThroughputConfigDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Active throughput configuration of the feature group. There are two
modes: C<ON_DEMAND> and C<PROVISIONED>. With on-demand mode, you are
charged for data reads and writes that your application performs on
your feature group. You do not need to specify read and write
throughput because Feature Store accommodates your workloads as they
ramp up and down. You can switch a feature group to on-demand only once
in a 24 hour period. With provisioned throughput mode, you specify the
read and write capacity per second that you expect your application to
require, and you are billed based on those limits. Exceeding
provisioned throughput will result in your requests being throttled.

Note: C<PROVISIONED> throughput mode is supported only for feature
groups that are offline-only, or use the C<Standard>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_OnlineStoreConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-OnlineStoreConfig-StorageType)
tier online store.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ProvisionedReadCapacityUnits => Int

For provisioned feature groups with online store enabled, this
indicates the read throughput you are billed for and can consume
without throttling.

This field is not applicable for on-demand feature groups.


=head2 ProvisionedWriteCapacityUnits => Int

For provisioned feature groups, this indicates the write throughput you
are billed for and can consume without throttling.

This field is not applicable for on-demand feature groups.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ThroughputMode => Str

The mode used for your feature group throughput: C<ON_DEMAND> or
C<PROVISIONED>.
