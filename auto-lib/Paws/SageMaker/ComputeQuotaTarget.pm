=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FairShareWeight => $value, ..., TeamName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ComputeQuotaTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FairShareWeight

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The target entity to allocate compute resources to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FairShareWeight => Int

Assigned entity fair-share weight. Idle compute will be shared across
entities based on these assigned weights. This weight is only used when
C<FairShare> is enabled.

A weight of 0 is the lowest priority and 100 is the highest. Weight 0
is the default.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TeamName => Str

Name of the team to allocate compute resources to.
