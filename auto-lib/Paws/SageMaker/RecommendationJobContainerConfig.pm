=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobContainerConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobContainerConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataInputConfig => $value, ..., Task => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobContainerConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataInputConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies mandatory fields for running an Inference Recommender job
directly in the CreateInferenceRecommendationsJob
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateInferenceRecommendationsJob.html)
API. The fields specified in C<ContainerConfig> override the
corresponding fields in the model package. Use C<ContainerConfig> if
you want to specify these fields for the recommendation job but don't
want to edit them in your model package.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataInputConfig => Str

Specifies the name and shape of the expected data inputs for your
trained model with a JSON dictionary form. This field is used for
optimizing your model using SageMaker Neo. For more information, see
DataInputConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_InputConfig.html#sagemaker-Type-InputConfig-DataInputConfig).


=head2 Domain => Str

The machine learning domain of the model and its components.

Valid Values: C<COMPUTER_VISION | NATURAL_LANGUAGE_PROCESSING |
MACHINE_LEARNING>


=head2 Framework => Str

The machine learning framework of the container image.

Valid Values: C<TENSORFLOW | PYTORCH | XGBOOST |
SAGEMAKER-SCIKIT-LEARN>


=head2 FrameworkVersion => Str

The framework version of the container image.


=head2 NearestModelName => Str

The name of a pre-trained machine learning model benchmarked by Amazon
SageMaker Inference Recommender that matches your model.

Valid Values: C<efficientnetb7 | unet | xgboost | faster-rcnn-resnet101
| nasnetlarge | vgg16 | inception-v3 | mask-rcnn |
sagemaker-scikit-learn | densenet201-gluon | resnet18v2-gluon |
xception | densenet201 | yolov4 | resnet152 | bert-base-cased |
xceptionV1-keras | resnet50 | retinanet>


=head2 PayloadConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::RecommendationJobPayloadConfig>

Specifies the C<SamplePayloadUrl> and all other sample payload-related
fields.


=head2 SupportedEndpointType => Str

The endpoint type to receive recommendations for. By default this is
null, and the results of the inference recommendation job return a
combined list of both real-time and serverless benchmarks. By
specifying a value for this field, you can receive a longer list of
benchmarks for the desired endpoint type.


=head2 SupportedInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the instance types that are used to generate inferences in
real-time.


=head2 SupportedResponseMIMETypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The supported MIME types for the output data.


=head2 Task => Str

The machine learning task that the model accomplishes.

Valid Values: C<IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION | OBJECT_DETECTION |
TEXT_GENERATION | IMAGE_SEGMENTATION | FILL_MASK | CLASSIFICATION |
REGRESSION | OTHER>
