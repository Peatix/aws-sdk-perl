=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::DescribeDevice - Arguments for method DescribeDevice on L<Paws::SageMaker>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeDevice on the
L<Amazon SageMaker Service|Paws::SageMaker> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeDevice.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeDevice.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.sagemaker = Paws->service('SageMaker');
    my $DescribeDeviceResponse = $api . sagemaker->DescribeDevice(
      DeviceFleetName => 'MyEntityName',
      DeviceName      => 'MyEntityName',
      NextToken       => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AgentVersion     = $DescribeDeviceResponse->AgentVersion;
    my $Description      = $DescribeDeviceResponse->Description;
    my $DeviceArn        = $DescribeDeviceResponse->DeviceArn;
    my $DeviceFleetName  = $DescribeDeviceResponse->DeviceFleetName;
    my $DeviceName       = $DescribeDeviceResponse->DeviceName;
    my $IotThingName     = $DescribeDeviceResponse->IotThingName;
    my $LatestHeartbeat  = $DescribeDeviceResponse->LatestHeartbeat;
    my $MaxModels        = $DescribeDeviceResponse->MaxModels;
    my $Models           = $DescribeDeviceResponse->Models;
    my $NextToken        = $DescribeDeviceResponse->NextToken;
    my $RegistrationTime = $DescribeDeviceResponse->RegistrationTime;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SageMaker::DescribeDeviceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
