=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::QueryFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::QueryFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAfter => $value, ..., Types => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::QueryFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAfter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of filters to narrow the set of lineage entities connected to the
C<StartArn>(s) returned by the C<QueryLineage> API action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAfter => Str

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) after the
create date.


=head2 CreatedBefore => Str

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) by created
date.


=head2 LineageTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) by the type
of the lineage entity.


=head2 ModifiedAfter => Str

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) after the
last modified date.


=head2 ModifiedBefore => Str

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) before the
last modified date.


=head2 Properties => L<Paws::SageMaker::QueryProperties>

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn>(s) by a set if
property key value pairs. If multiple pairs are provided, an entity is
included in the results if it matches any of the provided pairs.


=head2 Types => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Filter the lineage entities connected to the C<StartArn> by type. For
example: C<DataSet>, C<Model>, C<Endpoint>, or C<ModelDeployment>.
