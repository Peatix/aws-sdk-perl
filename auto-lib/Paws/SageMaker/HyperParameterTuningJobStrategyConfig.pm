=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobStrategyConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobStrategyConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HyperbandStrategyConfig => $value, ..., HyperbandStrategyConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::HyperParameterTuningJobStrategyConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HyperbandStrategyConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for a training job launched by a hyperparameter
tuning job. Choose C<Bayesian> for Bayesian optimization, and C<Random>
for random search optimization. For more advanced use cases, use
C<Hyperband>, which evaluates objective metrics for training jobs after
every epoch. For more information about strategies, see How
Hyperparameter Tuning Works
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning-how-it-works.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HyperbandStrategyConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::HyperbandStrategyConfig>

The configuration for the object that specifies the C<Hyperband>
strategy. This parameter is only supported for the C<Hyperband>
selection for C<Strategy> within the C<HyperParameterTuningJobConfig>
API.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMaker>
