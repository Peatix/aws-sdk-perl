=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::EmrSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::EmrSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssumableRoleArns => $value, ..., ExecutionRoleArns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::EmrSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssumableRoleArns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration parameters that specify the IAM roles assumed by the
execution role of SageMaker (assumable roles) and the cluster instances
or job execution environments (execution roles or runtime roles) to
manage and access resources required for running Amazon EMR clusters or
Amazon EMR Serverless applications.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssumableRoleArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM roles that the
execution role of SageMaker can assume for performing operations or
tasks related to Amazon EMR clusters or Amazon EMR Serverless
applications. These roles define the permissions and access policies
required when performing Amazon EMR-related operations, such as
listing, connecting to, or terminating Amazon EMR clusters or Amazon
EMR Serverless applications. They are typically used in cross-account
access scenarios, where the Amazon EMR resources (clusters or
serverless applications) are located in a different Amazon Web Services
account than the SageMaker domain.


=head2 ExecutionRoleArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM roles used by the
Amazon EMR cluster instances or job execution environments to access
other Amazon Web Services services and resources needed during the
runtime of your Amazon EMR or Amazon EMR Serverless workloads, such as
Amazon S3 for data access, Amazon CloudWatch for logging, or other
Amazon Web Services services based on the particular workload
requirements.
