=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStepMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStepMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoMLJob => $value, ..., TuningJob => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::PipelineExecutionStepMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoMLJob

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metadata for a step execution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

pipeline generated token, and a list of output parameters.


=head2 ClarifyCheck => L<Paws::SageMaker::ClarifyCheckStepMetadata>

Container for the metadata for a Clarify check step. The configurations
and outcomes of the check step execution. This includes:

used for the drift check.

=item *

The Amazon S3 URIs of newly calculated baseline constraints and
statistics.

=item *

The model package group name provided.

=item *

The Amazon S3 URI of the violation report if violations detected.

=item *

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of check processing job initiated by the
step execution.

=item *

The boolean flags indicating if the drift check is skipped.

=item *

If step property C<BaselineUsedForDriftCheck> is set the same as
C<CalculatedBaseline>.
