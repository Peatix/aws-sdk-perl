=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::FeatureDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::FeatureDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CollectionConfig => $value, ..., FeatureType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::FeatureDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CollectionConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of features. You must include C<FeatureName> and C<FeatureType>.
Valid feature C<FeatureType>s are C<Integral>, C<Fractional> and
C<String>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CollectionConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::CollectionConfig>

Configuration for your collection.


=head2 CollectionType => Str

A grouping of elements where each element within the collection must
have the same feature type (C<String>, C<Integral>, or C<Fractional>).

=over

=item *

C<List>: An ordered collection of elements.

=item *

C<Set>: An unordered collection of unique elements.

=item *

C<Vector>: A specialized list that represents a fixed-size array of
elements. The vector dimension is determined by you. Must have elements
with fractional feature types.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FeatureName => Str

The name of a feature. The type must be a string. C<FeatureName> cannot
be any of the following: C<is_deleted>, C<write_time>,
C<api_invocation_time>.

The name:

=over

=item *

Must start with an alphanumeric character.

=item *

Can only include alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.
Spaces are not allowed.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FeatureType => Str

The value type of a feature. Valid values are Integral, Fractional, or
String.
