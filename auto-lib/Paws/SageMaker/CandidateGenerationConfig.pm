=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::CandidateGenerationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::CandidateGenerationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlgorithmsConfig => $value, ..., AlgorithmsConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::CandidateGenerationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlgorithmsConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stores the configuration information for how model candidates are
generated using an AutoML job V2.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlgorithmsConfig => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLAlgorithmConfig>]

Your Autopilot job trains a default set of algorithms on your dataset.
For tabular and time-series data, you can customize the algorithm list
by selecting a subset of algorithms for your problem type.

C<AlgorithmsConfig> stores the customized selection of algorithms to
train on your data.

=over

=item *

B<For the tabular problem type C<TabularJobConfig>,> the list of
available algorithms to choose from depends on the training mode set in
C<AutoMLJobConfig.Mode>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLJobConfig.html).

=over

=item *

C<AlgorithmsConfig> should not be set when the training mode
C<AutoMLJobConfig.Mode> is set to C<AUTO>.

=item *

When C<AlgorithmsConfig> is provided, one C<AutoMLAlgorithms> attribute
must be set and one only.

If the list of algorithms provided as values for C<AutoMLAlgorithms> is
empty, C<CandidateGenerationConfig> uses the full set of algorithms for
the given training mode.

=item *

When C<AlgorithmsConfig> is not provided, C<CandidateGenerationConfig>
uses the full set of algorithms for the given training mode.

=back

For the list of all algorithms per training mode, see AlgorithmConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLAlgorithmConfig.html).

For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithm support
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-model-support-validation.html#autopilot-algorithm-support)
section in the Autopilot developer guide.

=item *

B<For the time-series forecasting problem type
C<TimeSeriesForecastingJobConfig>,> choose your algorithms from the
list provided in AlgorithmConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLAlgorithmConfig.html).

For more information on each algorithm, see the Algorithms support for
time-series forecasting
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/timeseries-forecasting-algorithms.html)
section in the Autopilot developer guide.

When C<AlgorithmsConfig> is provided, one C<AutoMLAlgorithms> attribute

time-series forecasting.
