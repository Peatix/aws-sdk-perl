=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::TabularJobConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::TabularJobConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CandidateGenerationConfig => $value, ..., TargetAttributeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::TabularJobConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CandidateGenerationConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The collection of settings used by an AutoML job V2 for the tabular
problem type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CandidateGenerationConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::CandidateGenerationConfig>

The configuration information of how model candidates are generated.


=head2 CompletionCriteria => L<Paws::SageMaker::AutoMLJobCompletionCriteria>




=head2 FeatureSpecificationS3Uri => Str

A URL to the Amazon S3 data source containing selected features from
the input data source to run an Autopilot job V2. You can input
C<FeatureAttributeNames> (optional) in JSON format as shown below:

C<{ "FeatureAttributeNames":["col1", "col2", ...] }>.

You can also specify the data type of the feature (optional) in the
format shown below:

C<{ "FeatureDataTypes":{"col1":"numeric", "col2":"categorical" ... } }>

These column keys may not include the target column.

In ensembling mode, Autopilot only supports the following data types:
C<numeric>, C<categorical>, C<text>, and C<datetime>. In HPO mode,
Autopilot can support C<numeric>, C<categorical>, C<text>, C<datetime>,
and C<sequence>.

If only C<FeatureDataTypes> is provided, the column keys (C<col1>,
C<col2>,..) should be a subset of the column names in the input data.

If both C<FeatureDataTypes> and C<FeatureAttributeNames> are provided,
then the column keys should be a subset of the column names provided in
C<FeatureAttributeNames>.

The key name C<FeatureAttributeNames> is fixed. The values listed in
C<["col1", "col2", ...]> are case sensitive and should be a list of
strings containing unique values that are a subset of the column names
in the input data. The list of columns provided must not include the
target column.


=head2 GenerateCandidateDefinitionsOnly => Bool

Generates possible candidates without training the models. A model
candidate is a combination of data preprocessors, algorithms, and
algorithm parameter settings.


=head2 Mode => Str

The method that Autopilot uses to train the data. You can either
specify the mode manually or let Autopilot choose for you based on the
dataset size by selecting C<AUTO>. In C<AUTO> mode, Autopilot chooses
C<ENSEMBLING> for datasets smaller than 100 MB, and
C<HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING> for larger ones.

The C<ENSEMBLING> mode uses a multi-stack ensemble model to predict
classification and regression tasks directly from your dataset. This
machine learning mode combines several base models to produce an
optimal predictive model. It then uses a stacking ensemble method to
combine predictions from contributing members. A multi-stack ensemble
model can provide better performance over a single model by combining
the predictive capabilities of multiple models. See Autopilot algorithm
support
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-model-support-validation.html#autopilot-algorithm-support)
for a list of algorithms supported by C<ENSEMBLING> mode.

The C<HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING> (HPO) mode uses the best hyperparameters
to train the best version of a model. HPO automatically selects an
algorithm for the type of problem you want to solve. Then HPO finds the
best hyperparameters according to your objective metric. See Autopilot
algorithm support
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-model-support-validation.html#autopilot-algorithm-support)
for a list of algorithms supported by C<HYPERPARAMETER_TUNING> mode.


=head2 ProblemType => Str

The type of supervised learning problem available for the model
candidates of the AutoML job V2. For more information, see SageMaker
Autopilot problem types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-datasets-problem-types.html#autopilot-problem-types).

You must either specify the type of supervised learning problem in
C<ProblemType> and provide the AutoMLJobObjective
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAutoMLJobV2.html#sagemaker-CreateAutoMLJobV2-request-AutoMLJobObjective)
metric, or none at all.


=head2 SampleWeightAttributeName => Str

If specified, this column name indicates which column of the dataset
should be treated as sample weights for use by the objective metric
during the training, evaluation, and the selection of the best model.
This column is not considered as a predictive feature. For more
information on Autopilot metrics, see Metrics and validation
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/autopilot-metrics-validation.html).

Sample weights should be numeric, non-negative, with larger values
indicating which rows are more important than others. Data points that
have invalid or no weight value are excluded.

Support for sample weights is available in Ensembling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AutoMLAlgorithmConfig.html)
mode only.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetAttributeName => Str

The name of the target variable in supervised learning, usually
represented by 'y'.
