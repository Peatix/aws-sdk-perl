=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalInferenceSpecifications => $value, ..., ValidationSpecification => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalInferenceSpecifications

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A container for your trained model that can be deployed for SageMaker
inference. This can include inference code, artifacts, and metadata.
The model package type can be one of the following.

=over

=item *

Versioned model: A part of a model package group in Model Registry.

=item *

Unversioned model: Not part of a model package group and used in Amazon
Web Services Marketplace.

=back

For more information, see C<CreateModelPackage>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateModelPackage.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalInferenceSpecifications => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::AdditionalInferenceSpecificationDefinition>]

An array of additional Inference Specification objects.


=head2 ApprovalDescription => Str

A description provided when the model approval is set.


=head2 CertifyForMarketplace => Bool

Whether the model package is to be certified to be listed on Amazon Web
Services Marketplace. For information about listing model packages on
Amazon Web Services Marketplace, see List Your Algorithm or Model
Package on Amazon Web Services Marketplace
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sagemaker-mkt-list.html).


=head2 CreatedBy => L<Paws::SageMaker::UserContext>

Information about the user who created or modified an experiment,
trial, trial component, lineage group, or project.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The time that the model package was created.


=head2 CustomerMetadataProperties => L<Paws::SageMaker::CustomerMetadataMap>

The metadata properties for the model package.


=head2 Domain => Str

The machine learning domain of your model package and its components.
Common machine learning domains include computer vision and natural
language processing.


=head2 DriftCheckBaselines => L<Paws::SageMaker::DriftCheckBaselines>

Represents the drift check baselines that can be used when the model
monitor is set using the model package.


=head2 InferenceSpecification => L<Paws::SageMaker::InferenceSpecification>

Defines how to perform inference generation after a training job is
run.


=head2 LastModifiedBy => L<Paws::SageMaker::UserContext>

Information about the user who created or modified an experiment,
trial, trial component, lineage group, or project.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The last time the model package was modified.


=head2 MetadataProperties => L<Paws::SageMaker::MetadataProperties>

Metadata properties of the tracking entity, trial, or trial component.


=head2 ModelApprovalStatus => Str

The approval status of the model. This can be one of the following
values.

=over

=item *

C<APPROVED> - The model is approved

=item *

C<REJECTED> - The model is rejected.

=item *

C<PENDING_MANUAL_APPROVAL> - The model is waiting for manual approval.

=back



=head2 ModelCard => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageModelCard>




=head2 ModelLifeCycle => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelLifeCycle>

A structure describing the current state of the model in its life
cycle.


=head2 ModelMetrics => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelMetrics>

Metrics for the model.


=head2 ModelPackageArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model package.


=head2 ModelPackageDescription => Str

The description of the model package.


=head2 ModelPackageGroupName => Str

The model group to which the model belongs.


=head2 ModelPackageName => Str

The name of the model package. The name can be as follows:

=over

=item *

For a versioned model, the name is automatically generated by SageMaker
Model Registry and follows the format
'C<ModelPackageGroupName/ModelPackageVersion>'.

=item *

For an unversioned model, you must provide the name.

=back



=head2 ModelPackageStatus => Str

The status of the model package. This can be one of the following
values.

=over

=item *

C<PENDING> - The model package is pending being created.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> - The model package is in the process of being created.

=item *

C<COMPLETED> - The model package was successfully created.

=item *

C<FAILED> - The model package failed.

=item *

C<DELETING> - The model package is in the process of being deleted.

=back



=head2 ModelPackageStatusDetails => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageStatusDetails>

Specifies the validation and image scan statuses of the model package.


=head2 ModelPackageVersion => Int

The version number of a versioned model.


=head2 SamplePayloadUrl => Str

The Amazon Simple Storage Service path where the sample payload are
stored. This path must point to a single gzip compressed tar archive
(.tar.gz suffix).


=head2 SecurityConfig => L<Paws::SageMaker::ModelPackageSecurityConfig>




=head2 SkipModelValidation => Str

Indicates if you want to skip model validation.


=head2 SourceAlgorithmSpecification => L<Paws::SageMaker::SourceAlgorithmSpecification>

=head2 SourceUri => Str

The URI of the source for the model package.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::Tag>]

A list of the tags associated with the model package. For more
information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide>.


=head2 Task => Str

The machine learning task your model package accomplishes. Common
