=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMaker::SelectiveExecutionConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMaker::SelectiveExecutionConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SelectedSteps => $value, ..., SourcePipelineExecutionArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMaker::SelectiveExecutionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SelectedSteps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The selective execution configuration applied to the pipeline run.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SelectedSteps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SageMaker::SelectedStep>]

A list of pipeline steps to run. All step(s) in all path(s) between two
selected steps should be included.


=head2 SourcePipelineExecutionArn => Str

The ARN from a reference execution of the current pipeline. Used to
copy input collaterals needed for the selected steps to run. The
execution status of the pipeline can be either C<Failed> or C<Success>.

This field is required if the steps you specify for C<SelectedSteps>
depend on output collaterals from any non-specified pipeline steps. For
more information, see Selective Execution for Pipeline Steps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-selective-ex.html).
