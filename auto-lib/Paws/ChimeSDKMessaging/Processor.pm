=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKMessaging::Processor

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKMessaging::Processor object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Configuration => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKMessaging::Processor object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The information about a processor in a channel flow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Configuration => L<Paws::ChimeSDKMessaging::ProcessorConfiguration>

The information about the type of processor and its identifier.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExecutionOrder => Int

The sequence in which processors run. If you have multiple processors
in a channel flow, message processing goes through each processor in
the sequence. The value determines the sequence. At this point, we
support only 1 processor within a flow.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FallbackAction => Str

Determines whether to continue with message processing or stop it in
cases where communication with a processor fails. If a processor has a
fallback action of C<ABORT> and communication with it fails, the
processor sets the message status to C<FAILED> and does not send the
message to any recipients. Note that if the last processor in the
channel flow sequence has a fallback action of C<CONTINUE> and
communication with the processor fails, then the message is considered
processed and sent to recipients of the channel.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the channel flow.
