=head1 NAME

Paws::STS::AssumeRoleWithSAMLResponse

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssumedRoleUser => L<Paws::STS::AssumedRoleUser>

The identifiers for the temporary security credentials that the
operation returns.


=head2 Audience => Str

The value of the C<Recipient> attribute of the
C<SubjectConfirmationData> element of the SAML assertion.


=head2 Credentials => L<Paws::STS::Credentials>

The temporary security credentials, which include an access key ID, a
secret access key, and a security (or session) token.

The size of the security token that STS API operations return is not
fixed. We strongly recommend that you make no assumptions about the
maximum size.


=head2 Issuer => Str

The value of the C<Issuer> element of the SAML assertion.


=head2 NameQualifier => Str

A hash value based on the concatenation of the following:

=over

=item *

The C<Issuer> response value.

=item *

The Amazon Web Services account ID.

=item *

The friendly name (the last part of the ARN) of the SAML provider in
IAM.

=back

The combination of C<NameQualifier> and C<Subject> can be used to
uniquely identify a user.

The following pseudocode shows how the hash value is calculated:

C<BASE64 ( SHA1 ( "https://example.com/saml" + "123456789012" +
"/MySAMLIdP" ) )>


=head2 PackedPolicySize => Int

A percentage value that indicates the packed size of the session
policies and session tags combined passed in the request. The request
fails if the packed size is greater than 100 percent, which means the
policies and tags exceeded the allowed space.


=head2 SourceIdentity => Str

The value in the C<SourceIdentity> attribute in the SAML assertion. The
source identity value persists across chained role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#iam-term-role-chaining)
sessions.

You can require users to set a source identity value when they assume a
role. You do this by using the C<sts:SourceIdentity> condition key in a
role trust policy. That way, actions that are taken with the role are
associated with that user. After the source identity is set, the value
cannot be changed. It is present in the request for all actions that
are taken by the role and persists across chained role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#id_roles_terms-and-concepts)
sessions. You can configure your SAML identity provider to use an
attribute associated with your users, like user name or email, as the
source identity when calling C<AssumeRoleWithSAML>. You do this by
adding an attribute to the SAML assertion. For more information about
using source identity, see Monitor and control actions taken with
assumed roles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_monitor.html)
in the I<IAM User Guide>.

The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no
spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following
characters: =,.@-


=head2 Subject => Str

The value of the C<NameID> element in the C<Subject> element of the
SAML assertion.


=head2 SubjectType => Str

The format of the name ID, as defined by the C<Format> attribute in the
C<NameID> element of the SAML assertion. Typical examples of the format
are C<transient> or C<persistent>.

If the format includes the prefix
C<urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format>, that prefix is removed.
For example, C<urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient> is
returned as C<transient>. If the format includes any other prefix, the
format is returned with no modifications.


=head2 _request_id => Str
