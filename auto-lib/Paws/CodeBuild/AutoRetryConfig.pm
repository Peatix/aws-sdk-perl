=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::AutoRetryConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::AutoRetryConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoRetryLimit => $value, ..., PreviousAutoRetry => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::AutoRetryConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoRetryLimit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the auto-retry configuration for the build.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoRetryLimit => Int

The maximum number of additional automatic retries after a failed
build. For example, if the auto-retry limit is set to 2, CodeBuild will
call the C<RetryBuild> API to automatically retry your build for up to
2 additional times.


=head2 AutoRetryNumber => Int

The number of times that the build has been retried. The initial build
will have an auto-retry number of 0.


=head2 NextAutoRetry => Str

The build ARN of the auto-retried build triggered by the current build.
The next auto-retry will be C<null> for builds that don't trigger an
auto-retry.


=head2 PreviousAutoRetry => Str

The build ARN of the build that triggered the current auto-retry build.
The previous auto-retry will be C<null> for the initial build.
