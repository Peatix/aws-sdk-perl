=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::EnvironmentVariable

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::EnvironmentVariable object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::EnvironmentVariable object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an environment variable for a build project or a
build.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name or key of the environment variable.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of environment variable. Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<PARAMETER_STORE>: An environment variable stored in Systems Manager
Parameter Store. For environment variables of this type, specify the
name of the parameter as the C<value> of the EnvironmentVariable. The
parameter value will be substituted for the name at runtime. You can
also define Parameter Store environment variables in the buildspec. To
learn how to do so, see env/parameter-store
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.parameter-store)
in the I<CodeBuild User Guide>.

=item *

C<PLAINTEXT>: An environment variable in plain text format. This is the
default value.

=item *

C<SECRETS_MANAGER>: An environment variable stored in Secrets Manager.
For environment variables of this type, specify the name of the secret
as the C<value> of the EnvironmentVariable. The secret value will be
substituted for the name at runtime. You can also define Secrets
Manager environment variables in the buildspec. To learn how to do so,
see env/secrets-manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec.env.secrets-manager)
in the I<CodeBuild User Guide>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Str

The value of the environment variable.

We strongly discourage the use of C<PLAINTEXT> environment variables to
store sensitive values, especially Amazon Web Services secret key IDs.
C<PLAINTEXT> environment variables can be displayed in plain text using
the CodeBuild console and the CLI. For sensitive values, we recommend
you use an environment variable of type C<PARAMETER_STORE> or
C<SECRETS_MANAGER>.
