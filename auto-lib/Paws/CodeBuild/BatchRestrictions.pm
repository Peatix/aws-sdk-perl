=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::BatchRestrictions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::BatchRestrictions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeTypesAllowed => $value, ..., MaximumBuildsAllowed => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::BatchRestrictions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeTypesAllowed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies restrictions for the batch build.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeTypesAllowed => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of strings that specify the compute types that are allowed for
the batch build. See Build environment compute types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-compute-types.html)
in the I<CodeBuild User Guide> for these values.


=head2 FleetsAllowed => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of strings that specify the fleets that are allowed for the
batch build. See Run builds on reserved capacity fleets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/fleets.html) in
the I<CodeBuild User Guide> for more information.


=head2 MaximumBuildsAllowed => Int

Specifies the maximum number of builds allowed.
