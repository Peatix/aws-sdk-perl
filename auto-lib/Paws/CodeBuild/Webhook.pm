=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeBuild::Webhook

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeBuild::Webhook object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BranchFilter => $value, ..., Url => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeBuild::Webhook object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BranchFilter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a webhook that connects repository events to a build
project in CodeBuild.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BranchFilter => Str

A regular expression used to determine which repository branches are
built when a webhook is triggered. If the name of a branch matches the
regular expression, then it is built. If C<branchFilter> is empty, then
all branches are built.

It is recommended that you use C<filterGroups> instead of
C<branchFilter>.


=head2 BuildType => Str

Specifies the type of build this webhook will trigger.

C<RUNNER_BUILDKITE_BUILD> is only available for C<NO_SOURCE> source
type projects configured for Buildkite runner builds. For more
information about CodeBuild-hosted Buildkite runner builds, see
Tutorial: Configure a CodeBuild-hosted Buildkite runner
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-runner-buildkite.html)
in the I<CodeBuild user guide>.


=head2 FilterGroups => ArrayRef[L<ArrayRef[Paws::CodeBuild::WebhookFilter]>]

An array of arrays of C<WebhookFilter> objects used to determine which
webhooks are triggered. At least one C<WebhookFilter> in the array must
specify C<EVENT> as its C<type>.

For a build to be triggered, at least one filter group in the
C<filterGroups> array must pass. For a filter group to pass, each of
its filters must pass.


=head2 LastModifiedSecret => Str

A timestamp that indicates the last time a repository's secret token
was modified.


=head2 ManualCreation => Bool

If manualCreation is true, CodeBuild doesn't create a webhook in GitHub
and instead returns C<payloadUrl> and C<secret> values for the webhook.
The C<payloadUrl> and C<secret> values in the output can be used to
manually create a webhook within GitHub.

manualCreation is only available for GitHub webhooks.


=head2 PayloadUrl => Str

The CodeBuild endpoint where webhook events are sent.


=head2 ScopeConfiguration => L<Paws::CodeBuild::ScopeConfiguration>

The scope configuration for global or organization webhooks.

Global or organization webhooks are only available for GitHub and
Github Enterprise webhooks.


=head2 Secret => Str

The secret token of the associated repository.

A Bitbucket webhook does not support C<secret>.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the webhook. Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<CREATING>: The webhook is being created.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED>: The webhook has failed to create.

=item *

C<ACTIVE>: The webhook has succeeded and is active.

=item *

C<DELETING>: The webhook is being deleted.

=back



=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A message associated with the status of a webhook.


=head2 Url => Str

The URL to the webhook.
