=head1 NAME

Paws::PersonalizeEvents::ActionInteraction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PersonalizeEvents::ActionInteraction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionId => $value, ..., UserId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PersonalizeEvents::ActionInteraction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents an action interaction event sent using the
C<PutActionInteractions> API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActionId => Str

The ID of the action the user interacted with. This corresponds to the
C<ACTION_ID> field of the Action interaction schema.


=head2 EventId => Str

An ID associated with the event. If an event ID is not provided, Amazon
Personalize generates a unique ID for the event. An event ID is not
used as an input to the model. Amazon Personalize uses the event ID to
distinguish unique events. Any subsequent events after the first with
the same event ID are not used in model training.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventType => Str

The type of action interaction event. You can specify C<Viewed>,
C<Taken>, and C<Not Taken> event types. For more information about
action interaction event type data, see Event type data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/action-interaction-event-type-data.html).


=head2 Impression => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of action IDs that represents the sequence of actions you have
shown the user. For example, C<["actionId1", "actionId2",
"actionId3"]>. Amazon Personalize doesn't use impressions data from
action interaction events. Instead, record multiple events for each
action and use the C<Viewed> event type.


=head2 Properties => Str

A string map of event-specific data that you might choose to record.
For example, if a user takes an action, other than the action ID, you
might also send the number of actions taken by the user.

Each item in the map consists of a key-value pair. For example,

C<{"numberOfActions": "12"}>

The keys use camel case names that match the fields in the Action
interactions schema. In the above example, the C<numberOfActions> would
match the 'NUMBER_OF_ACTIONS' field defined in the Action interactions
schema.

The following can't be included as a keyword for properties (case
insensitive).

=head2 RecommendationId => Str

The ID of the list of recommendations that contains the action the user
interacted with.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SessionId => Str

The ID associated with the user's visit. Your application generates a
unique C<sessionId> when a user first visits your website or uses your
application.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Timestamp => Str

The timestamp for when the action interaction event occurred.
Timestamps must be in Unix epoch time format, in seconds.


=head2 UserId => Str

The ID of the user who interacted with the action. This corresponds to
the C<USER_ID> field of the Action interaction schema.
