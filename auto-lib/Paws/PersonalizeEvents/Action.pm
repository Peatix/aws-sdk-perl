=head1 NAME

Paws::PersonalizeEvents::Action

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PersonalizeEvents::Action object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionId => $value, ..., Properties => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PersonalizeEvents::Action object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents action metadata added to an Action dataset using the
C<PutActions> API. For more information see Importing actions
individually
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/importing-actions.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActionId => Str

The ID associated with the action.


=head2 Properties => Str

A string map of action-specific metadata. Each element in the map
consists of a key-value pair. For example, C<{"value": "100"}>.

The keys use camel case names that match the fields in the schema for
the Actions dataset. In the previous example, the C<value> matches the
'VALUE' field defined in the Actions schema. For categorical string
data, to include multiple categories for a single action, separate each
category with a pipe separator (C<|>). For example,
C<\"Deluxe|Premium\">.
