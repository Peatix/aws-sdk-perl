=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendedOptionProjectedMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ProjectedMetrics => $value, ..., RecommendedInstanceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ProjectedMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a projected utilization metric of a recommendation option.

The C<Cpu> and C<Memory> metrics are the only projected utilization
metrics returned when you run the GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics
action. Additionally, the C<Memory> metric is returned only for
resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them. For
more information, see Enabling Memory Utilization with the CloudWatch
Agent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ProjectedMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ProjectedMetric>]

An array of objects that describe a projected utilization metric.


=head2 Rank => Int

The rank of the recommendation option projected metric.

The top recommendation option is ranked as C<1>.

The projected metric rank correlates to the recommendation option rank.
For example, the projected metric ranked as C<1> is related to the
recommendation option that is also ranked as C<1> in the same response.


=head2 RecommendedInstanceType => Str

The recommended instance type.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer>
