=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ProjectedMetrics => $value, ..., RecommendedMemorySize => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ProjectedMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the projected metrics of an Amazon ECS service recommendation
option.

To determine the performance difference between your current Amazon ECS
service and the recommended option, compare the metric data of your
service against its projected metric data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ProjectedMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceProjectedMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the projected metric.


=head2 RecommendedCpuUnits => Int

The recommended CPU size for the Amazon ECS service.


=head2 RecommendedMemorySize => Int

The recommended memory size for the Amazon ECS service.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer>
