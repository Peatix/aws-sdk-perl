=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EstimatedMonthlySavings => $value, ..., SavingsOpportunityPercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EstimatedMonthlySavings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the savings opportunity for recommendations of a given
resource type or for the recommendation option of an individual
resource.

Savings opportunity represents the estimated monthly savings you can
achieve by implementing a given Compute Optimizer recommendation.

Savings opportunity data requires that you opt in to Cost Explorer, as
well as activate B<Receive Amazon EC2 resource recommendations> in the
Cost Explorer preferences page. That creates a connection between Cost
Explorer and Compute Optimizer. With this connection, Cost Explorer
generates savings estimates considering the price of existing
resources, the price of recommended resources, and historical usage
data. Estimated monthly savings reflects the projected dollar savings
associated with each of the recommendations generated. For more
information, see Enabling Cost Explorer
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-enable.html)
and Optimizing your cost with Rightsizing Recommendations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/ce-rightsizing.html)
in the I<Cost Management User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

by adopting Compute Optimizer recommendations for a given resource.
This is based on the On-Demand instance pricing..


=head2 SavingsOpportunityPercentage => Num
