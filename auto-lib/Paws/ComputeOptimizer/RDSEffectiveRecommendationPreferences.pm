=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSEffectiveRecommendationPreferences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSEffectiveRecommendationPreferences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CpuVendorArchitectures => $value, ..., SavingsEstimationMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSEffectiveRecommendationPreferences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CpuVendorArchitectures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the effective recommendation preferences for Amazon RDS.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CpuVendorArchitectures => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Describes the CPU vendor and architecture for Amazon RDS
recommendations.


=head2 EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics => Str

Describes the activation status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics
preference.

A status of C<Active> confirms that the preference is applied in the
latest recommendation refresh, and a status of C<Inactive> confirms
that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.


=head2 LookBackPeriod => Str

The number of days the utilization metrics of the Amazon RDS are
analyzed.


=head2 SavingsEstimationMode => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSSavingsEstimationMode>

Describes the savings estimation mode preference applied for
calculating savings opportunity for Amazon RDS.
