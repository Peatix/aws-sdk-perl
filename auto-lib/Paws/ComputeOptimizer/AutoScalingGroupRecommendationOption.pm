=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Configuration => $value, ..., SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupRecommendationOption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a recommendation option for an Auto Scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Configuration => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupConfiguration>

An array of objects that describe an Auto Scaling group configuration.


=head2 InstanceGpuInfo => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::GpuInfo>

Describes the GPU accelerator settings for the recommended instance
type of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 MigrationEffort => Str

The level of effort required to migrate from the current instance type
to the recommended instance type.

For example, the migration effort is C<Low> if Amazon EMR is the
inferred workload type and an Amazon Web Services Graviton instance
type is recommended. The migration effort is C<Medium> if a workload
type couldn't be inferred but an Amazon Web Services Graviton instance
type is recommended. The migration effort is C<VeryLow> if both the
current and recommended instance types are of the same CPU
architecture.


=head2 PerformanceRisk => Num

The performance risk of the Auto Scaling group configuration
recommendation.

Performance risk indicates the likelihood of the recommended instance
type not meeting the resource needs of your workload. Compute Optimizer
calculates an individual performance risk score for each specification
of the recommended instance, including CPU, memory, EBS throughput, EBS
IOPS, disk throughput, disk IOPS, network throughput, and network PPS.
The performance risk of the recommended instance is calculated as the
maximum performance risk score across the analyzed resource
specifications.

The value ranges from C<0> - C<4>, with C<0> meaning that the
recommended resource is predicted to always provide enough hardware
capability. The higher the performance risk is, the more likely you
should validate whether the recommendation will meet the performance
requirements of your workload before migrating your resource.


=head2 ProjectedUtilizationMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the projected utilization metrics of
the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.

The C<Cpu> and C<Memory> metrics are the only projected utilization
metrics returned. Additionally, the C<Memory> metric is returned only
for resources that have the unified CloudWatch agent installed on them.
For more information, see Enabling Memory Utilization with the
CloudWatch Agent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/metrics.html#cw-agent).


=head2 Rank => Int

The rank of the Auto Scaling group recommendation option.

The top recommendation option is ranked as C<1>.


=head2 SavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>

An object that describes the savings opportunity for the Auto Scaling
group recommendation option. Savings opportunity includes the estimated
monthly savings amount and percentage.


=head2 SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupSavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts>

An object that describes the savings opportunity for the Auto Scaling
group recommendation option that includes Savings Plans and Reserved
Instances discounts. Savings opportunity includes the estimated monthly
savings and percentage.
