=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDatabaseRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDatabaseRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ProjectedMetrics => $value, ..., RecommendedDBInstanceClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDatabaseRecommendedOptionProjectedMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ProjectedMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the projected metrics of an Amazon RDS recommendation option.

To determine the performance difference between your current Amazon RDS
and the recommended option, compare the metric data of your service
against its projected metric data.
