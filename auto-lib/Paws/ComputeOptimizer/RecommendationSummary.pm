=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., Summaries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of a recommendation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID of the recommendation summary.


=head2 AggregatedSavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>




=head2 CurrentPerformanceRiskRatings => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CurrentPerformanceRiskRatings>

An object that describes the performance risk ratings for a given
resource type.


=head2 IdleSavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>




=head2 IdleSummaries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::IdleSummary>]

Describes the findings summary of the idle resources.


=head2 InferredWorkloadSavings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::InferredWorkloadSaving>]

An array of objects that describes the estimated monthly saving amounts
for the instances running on the specified C<inferredWorkloadTypes>.
The array contains the top five savings opportunites for the instances
that run inferred workload types.


=head2 RecommendationResourceType => Str

The resource type that the recommendation summary applies to.


=head2 SavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>

An object that describes the savings opportunity for a given resource
type. Savings opportunity includes the estimated monthly savings amount
and percentage.


=head2 Summaries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Summary>]

An array of objects that describe a recommendation summary.
