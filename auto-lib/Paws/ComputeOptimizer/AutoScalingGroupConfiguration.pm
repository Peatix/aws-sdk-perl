=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::AutoScalingGroupConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration of an EC2 Auto Scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

Describes the allocation strategy that the EC2 Auto Scaling group uses.
This field is only available for EC2 Auto Scaling groups with mixed
instance types.


=head2 DesiredCapacity => Int

The desired capacity, or number of instances, for the EC2 Auto Scaling
group.


=head2 EstimatedInstanceHourReductionPercentage => Num

Describes the projected percentage reduction in instance hours after
adopting the recommended configuration. This field is only available
for EC2 Auto Scaling groups with scaling policies.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type for the EC2 Auto Scaling group.


=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum size, or maximum number of instances, for the EC2 Auto
Scaling group.


=head2 MinSize => Int

The minimum size, or minimum number of instances, for the EC2 Auto
Scaling group.


=head2 MixedInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

List the instance types within an EC2 Auto Scaling group that has mixed
instance types.


=head2 Type => Str

Describes whether the EC2 Auto Scaling group has a single instance type
or a mixed instance type configuration.
