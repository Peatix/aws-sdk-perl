=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CpuVendorArchitectures => $value, ..., CpuVendorArchitectures => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CpuVendorArchitectures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the recommendation preferences to return in the response of a
GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations, GetEC2InstanceRecommendations,
GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics, GetRDSDatabaseRecommendations,
and GetRDSDatabaseRecommendationProjectedMetrics request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CpuVendorArchitectures => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the CPU vendor and architecture for Amazon EC2 instance and
Auto Scaling group recommendations.

For example, when you specify C<AWS_ARM64> with:

=over

=item *

A GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
request, Compute Optimizer returns recommendations that consist of
Graviton instance types only.

=item *

A GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Optimizer
returns projected utilization metrics for Graviton instance type
recommendations only.

=item *

A ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations or
ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer
exports recommendations that consist of Graviton instance types only.
