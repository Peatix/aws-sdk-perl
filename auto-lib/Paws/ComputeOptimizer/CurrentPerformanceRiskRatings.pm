=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CurrentPerformanceRiskRatings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CurrentPerformanceRiskRatings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { High => $value, ..., VeryLow => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CurrentPerformanceRiskRatings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->High

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the performance risk ratings for a given resource type.

Resources with a C<high> or C<medium> rating are at risk of not meeting
the performance needs of their workloads, while resources with a C<low>
rating are performing well in their workloads.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 High => Int

rating.


=head2 Medium => Int

A count of the applicable resource types with a medium performance risk
rating.


=head2 VeryLow => Int
