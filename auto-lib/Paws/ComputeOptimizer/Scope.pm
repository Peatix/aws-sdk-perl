=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Scope

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Scope object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Scope object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the scope of a recommendation preference.

Recommendation preferences can be created at the organization level
(for management accounts of an organization only), account level, and
resource level. For more information, see Activating enhanced
infrastructure metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.

You cannot create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups at
the organization and account levels. You can create recommendation
preferences for Auto Scaling groups only at the resource level by
specifying a scope name of C<ResourceArn> and a scope value of the Auto
Scaling group Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This will configure the
preference for all instances that are part of the specified Auto
Scaling group. You also cannot create recommendation preferences at the
resource level for instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group.
You can create recommendation preferences at the resource level only
for standalone instances.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the scope.

The following scopes are possible:

=over

=item *

C<Organization> - Specifies that the recommendation preference applies
at the organization level, for all member accounts of an organization.

=item *

C<AccountId> - Specifies that the recommendation preference applies at
the account level, for all resources of a given resource type in an
account.

=item *

C<ResourceArn> - Specifies that the recommendation preference applies
at the individual resource level.

=back



=head2 Value => Str

The value of the scope.

If you specified the C<name> of the scope as:

=over

=item *

C<Organization> - The C<value> must be C<ALL_ACCOUNTS>.

=item *

C<AccountId> - The C<value> must be a 12-digit Amazon Web Services
account ID.

=item *

C<ResourceArn> - The C<value> must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

=back

Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently supported.
