=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon RDS
recommendations. Use this filter with the GetECSServiceRecommendations
action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the filter.

Specify C<Finding> to return recommendations with a specific finding
classification.

You can filter your Amazon RDS recommendations by C<tag:key> and
C<tag-key> tags.

A C<tag:key> is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to your
Amazon RDS recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter name and the
tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all Amazon RDS
service recommendations that have a tag with the key of C<Owner> and
the value of C<TeamA>, specify C<tag:Owner> for the filter name and
C<TeamA> for the filter value.

A C<tag-key> is the key of a tag assigned to your Amazon RDS
recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your Amazon RDS
recommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This
doesnE<rsquo>t consider the tag value. For example, you can find your
Amazon RDS service recommendations with a tag key value of C<Owner> or
without any tag keys assigned.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The value of the filter.
