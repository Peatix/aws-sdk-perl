=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CustomizableMetricParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CustomizableMetricParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Headroom => $value, ..., Threshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CustomizableMetricParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Headroom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the various metric parameters that can be customized, such as
threshold and headroom.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Headroom => Str

The headroom value in percentage used for the specified metric
parameter.

The following lists the valid values for CPU and memory utilization.

=over

=item *

CPU utilization: C<PERCENT_30 | PERCENT_20 | PERCENT_0>

=item *

Memory utilization: C<PERCENT_30 | PERCENT_20 | PERCENT_10>

=back



=head2 Threshold => Str

The threshold value used for the specified metric parameter.

You can only specify the threshold value for CPU utilization.
