=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::InferredWorkloadSaving

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::InferredWorkloadSaving object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EstimatedMonthlySavings => $value, ..., InferredWorkloadTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::InferredWorkloadSaving object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EstimatedMonthlySavings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The estimated monthly savings after you adjust the configurations of
your instances running on the inferred workload types to the
recommended configurations. If the C<inferredWorkloadTypes> list
contains multiple entries, then the savings are the sum of the monthly
savings from instances that run the exact combination of the inferred
workload types.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EstimatedMonthlySavings => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EstimatedMonthlySavings>

An object that describes the estimated monthly savings amount possible
by adopting Compute Optimizer recommendations for a given resource.
This is based on the On-Demand instance pricing.


=head2 InferredWorkloadTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The applications that might be running on the instance as inferred by
Compute Optimizer.

Compute Optimizer can infer if one of the following applications might
be running on the instance:

=over

=item *

C<AmazonEmr> - Infers that Amazon EMR might be running on the instance.

=item *

C<ApacheCassandra> - Infers that Apache Cassandra might be running on
the instance.

=item *

C<ApacheHadoop> - Infers that Apache Hadoop might be running on the
instance.

=item *

C<Memcached> - Infers that Memcached might be running on the instance.

=item *

C<NGINX> - Infers that NGINX might be running on the instance.

=item *

C<PostgreSql> - Infers that PostgreSQL might be running on the
instance.

=item *

C<Redis> - Infers that Redis might be running on the instance.

=item *

C<Kafka> - Infers that Kafka might be running on the instance.

=item *

C<SQLServer> - Infers that SQLServer might be running on the instance.
