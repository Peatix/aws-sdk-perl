=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationPreference

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationPreference object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricName => $value, ..., MetricParameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationPreference object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The preference to control the resourceE<rsquo>s CPU utilization
threshold, CPU utilization headroom, and memory utilization headroom.

This preference is only available for the Amazon EC2 instance resource
type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricName => Str

The name of the resource utilization metric name to customize.


=head2 MetricParameters => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::CustomizableMetricParameters>

The parameters to set when customizing the resource utilization
thresholds.
