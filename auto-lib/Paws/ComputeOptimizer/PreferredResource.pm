=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::PreferredResource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::PreferredResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExcludeList => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::PreferredResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExcludeList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The preference to control which resource type values are considered
when generating rightsizing recommendations. You can specify this
preference as a combination of include and exclude lists. You must
specify either an C<includeList> or C<excludeList>. If the preference
is an empty set of resource type values, an error occurs. For more
information, see Rightsizing recommendation preferences
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/rightsizing-preferences.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.
