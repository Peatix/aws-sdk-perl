=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EffectiveRecommendationPreferences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EffectiveRecommendationPreferences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CpuVendorArchitectures => $value, ..., UtilizationPreferences => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EffectiveRecommendationPreferences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CpuVendorArchitectures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the effective recommendation preferences for a resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CpuVendorArchitectures => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Describes the CPU vendor and architecture for an instance or Auto
Scaling group recommendations.

For example, when you specify C<AWS_ARM64> with:

=over

=item *

A GetEC2InstanceRecommendations or GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
request, Compute Optimizer returns recommendations that consist of
Graviton instance types only.

=item *

A GetEC2RecommendationProjectedMetrics request, Compute Optimizer
returns projected utilization metrics for Graviton instance type
recommendations only.

=item *

A ExportEC2InstanceRecommendations or
ExportAutoScalingGroupRecommendations request, Compute Optimizer
exports recommendations that consist of Graviton instance types only.

=back



=head2 EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics => Str

Describes the activation status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics
preference.

A status of C<Active> confirms that the preference is applied in the
latest recommendation refresh, and a status of C<Inactive> confirms
that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.


=head2 ExternalMetricsPreference => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ExternalMetricsPreference>

An object that describes the external metrics recommendation
preference.

If the preference is applied in the latest recommendation refresh, an
object with a valid C<source> value appears in the response. If the
preference isn't applied to the recommendations already, then this
object doesn't appear in the response.


=head2 InferredWorkloadTypes => Str

Describes the activation status of the inferred workload types
preference.

A status of C<Active> confirms that the preference is applied in the
latest recommendation refresh. A status of C<Inactive> confirms that
it's not yet applied to recommendations.


=head2 LookBackPeriod => Str

The number of days the utilization metrics of the Amazon Web Services
resource are analyzed.


=head2 PreferredResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EffectivePreferredResource>]

The resource type values that are considered as candidates when
generating rightsizing recommendations.


=head2 SavingsEstimationMode => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::InstanceSavingsEstimationMode>

Describes the savings estimation mode applied for calculating savings
opportunity for a resource.


=head2 UtilizationPreferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationPreference>]

The resourceE<rsquo>s CPU and memory utilization preferences, such as
threshold and headroom, that are used to generate rightsizing
recommendations.

This preference is only available for the Amazon EC2 instance resource
type.
