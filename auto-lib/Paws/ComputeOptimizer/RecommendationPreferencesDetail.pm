=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferencesDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferencesDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics => $value, ..., UtilizationPreferences => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RecommendationPreferencesDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a recommendation preference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics => Str

The status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics recommendation
preference.

When the recommendations page is refreshed, a status of C<Active>
confirms that the preference is applied to the recommendations, and a
status of C<Inactive> confirms that the preference isn't yet applied to
recommendations.

For more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.


=head2 ExternalMetricsPreference => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ExternalMetricsPreference>

An object that describes the external metrics recommendation
preference.

If the preference is applied in the latest recommendation refresh, an
object with a valid C<source> value appears in the response. If the
preference isn't applied to the recommendations already, then this
object doesn't appear in the response.


=head2 InferredWorkloadTypes => Str

The status of the inferred workload types recommendation preference.

When the recommendations page is refreshed, a status of C<Active>
confirms that the preference is applied to the recommendations, and a
status of C<Inactive> confirms that the preference isn't yet applied to
recommendations.


=head2 LookBackPeriod => Str

The preference to control the number of days the utilization metrics of
the Amazon Web Services resource are analyzed. If the preference
isnE<rsquo>t set, this object is null.


=head2 PreferredResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EffectivePreferredResource>]

The preference to control which resource type values are considered
when generating rightsizing recommendations. This object resolves any
wildcard expressions and returns the effective list of candidate
resource type values. If the preference isnE<rsquo>t set, this object
is null.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The target resource type of the recommendation preference to create.

The C<Ec2Instance> option encompasses standalone instances and
instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The C<AutoScalingGroup>
option encompasses only instances that are part of an Auto Scaling
group.


=head2 SavingsEstimationMode => Str

Describes the savings estimation mode used for calculating savings
opportunity.

Only the account manager or delegated administrator of your
organization can activate this preference.


=head2 Scope => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Scope>

An object that describes the scope of the recommendation preference.

Recommendation preferences can be created at the organization level
(for management accounts of an organization only), account level, and
resource level. For more information, see Activating enhanced
infrastructure metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/enhanced-infrastructure-metrics.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>.


=head2 UtilizationPreferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::UtilizationPreference>]

The preference to control the resourceE<rsquo>s CPU utilization
threshold, CPU utilization headroom, and memory utilization headroom.
If the preference isnE<rsquo>t set, this object is null.

This preference is only available for the Amazon EC2 instance resource
type.
