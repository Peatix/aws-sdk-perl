=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon ECS
service recommendations. Use this filter with the
GetECSServiceRecommendations action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the filter.

Specify C<Finding> to return recommendations with a specific finding
classification.

Specify C<FindingReasonCode> to return recommendations with a specific
finding reason code.

You can filter your Amazon ECS service recommendations by C<tag:key>
and C<tag-key> tags.

A C<tag:key> is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to your
Amazon ECS service recommendations. Use the tag key in the filter name
and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all Amazon
ECS service recommendations that have a tag with the key of C<Owner>
and the value of C<TeamA>, specify C<tag:Owner> for the filter name and
C<TeamA> for the filter value.

A C<tag-key> is the key of a tag assigned to your Amazon ECS service
recommendations. Use this filter to find all of your Amazon ECS service
recommendations that have a tag with a specific key. This
doesnE<rsquo>t consider the tag value. For example, you can find your
Amazon ECS service recommendations with a tag key value of C<Owner> or
without any tag keys assigned.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The value of the filter.

The valid values for this parameter are as follows:

=over

=item *

If you specify the C<name> parameter as C<Finding>, specify
C<Optimized>, C<Underprovisioned>, or C<Overprovisioned>.

=item *

If you specify the C<name> parameter as C<FindingReasonCode>, specify
C<CPUUnderprovisioned>, C<CPUOverprovisioned>,
C<MemoryUnderprovisioned>, or C<MemoryOverprovisioned>.
