=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationOption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationOption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerRecommendations => $value, ..., SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceRecommendationOption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerRecommendations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the recommendation options for an Amazon ECS service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerRecommendations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ContainerRecommendation>]

The CPU and memory size recommendations for the containers within the
task of your Amazon ECS service.


=head2 Cpu => Int

The CPU size of the Amazon ECS service recommendation option.


=head2 Memory => Int

The memory size of the Amazon ECS service recommendation option.


=head2 ProjectedUtilizationMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceProjectedUtilizationMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the projected utilization metrics of
the Amazon ECS service recommendation option.


=head2 SavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>




=head2 SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSSavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts>

Describes the savings opportunity for Amazon ECS service
recommendations or for the recommendation option.

Savings opportunity represents the estimated monthly savings after
applying Savings Plans discounts. You can achieve this by implementing
a given Compute Optimizer recommendation.
