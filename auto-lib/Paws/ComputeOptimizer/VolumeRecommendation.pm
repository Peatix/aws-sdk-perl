=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::VolumeRecommendation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::VolumeRecommendation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., VolumeRecommendationOptions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::VolumeRecommendation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume
recommendation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID of the volume.


=head2 CurrentConfiguration => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::VolumeConfiguration>

An array of objects that describe the current configuration of the
volume.


=head2 CurrentPerformanceRisk => Str

The risk of the current EBS volume not meeting the performance needs of
its workloads. The higher the risk, the more likely the current EBS
volume doesn't have sufficient capacity.


=head2 EffectiveRecommendationPreferences => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EBSEffectiveRecommendationPreferences>

Describes the effective recommendation preferences for Amazon EBS
volume.


=head2 Finding => Str

The finding classification of the volume.

Findings for volumes include:

=over

=item *

B<C<NotOptimized> >E<mdash>A volume is considered not optimized when
Compute Optimizer identifies a recommendation that can provide better
performance for your workload.

=item *

B<C<Optimized> >E<mdash>An volume is considered optimized when Compute
Optimizer determines that the volume is correctly provisioned to run
your workload based on the chosen volume type. For optimized resources,
Compute Optimizer might recommend a new generation volume type.

=back



=head2 LastRefreshTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of when the volume recommendation was last generated.


=head2 LookBackPeriodInDays => Num

The number of days for which utilization metrics were analyzed for the
volume.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::Tag>]

A list of tags assigned to your Amazon EBS volume recommendations.


=head2 UtilizationMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::EBSUtilizationMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the utilization metrics of the
volume.


=head2 VolumeArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the current volume.


=head2 VolumeRecommendationOptions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::VolumeRecommendationOption>]

An array of objects that describe the recommendation options for the
volume.
