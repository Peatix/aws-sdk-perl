=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceProjectedUtilizationMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceProjectedUtilizationMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LowerBoundValue => $value, ..., UpperBoundValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::ECSServiceProjectedUtilizationMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LowerBoundValue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the projected utilization metrics of an Amazon ECS service
recommendation option.

To determine the performance difference between your current Amazon ECS
service and the recommended option, compare the utilization metric data
of your service against its projected utilization metric data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LowerBoundValue => Num

The lower bound values for the projected utilization metrics.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the projected utilization metric.

The following utilization metrics are available:

=over

=item *

C<Cpu> E<mdash> The percentage of allocated compute units that are
currently in use on the service tasks.

=item *

C<Memory> E<mdash> The percentage of memory that's currently in use on
the service tasks.

=back



=head2 Statistic => Str

The statistic of the projected utilization metric.

The Compute Optimizer API, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs
return utilization metrics using only the C<Maximum> statistic, which
is the highest value observed during the specified period.

The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some utilization
metrics using the C<Average> statistic, which is the value of C<Sum> /
C<SampleCount> during the specified period. For more information, see
Viewing resource recommendations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/viewing-recommendations.html)
in the I<Compute Optimizer User Guide>. You can also get averaged
utilization metric data for your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For
more information, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html).


=head2 UpperBoundValue => Num

The upper bound values for the projected utilization metrics.
