=head1 NAME

Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDBInstanceRecommendationOption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDBInstanceRecommendationOption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DbInstanceClass => $value, ..., SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDBInstanceRecommendationOption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DbInstanceClass

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the recommendation options for an Amazon RDS instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DbInstanceClass => Str

Describes the DB instance class recommendation option for your Amazon
RDS instance.


=head2 PerformanceRisk => Num

The performance risk of the RDS instance recommendation option.


=head2 ProjectedUtilizationMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSDBUtilizationMetric>]

An array of objects that describe the projected utilization metrics of
the RDS instance recommendation option.


=head2 Rank => Int

The rank identifier of the RDS instance recommendation option.


=head2 SavingsOpportunity => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::SavingsOpportunity>




=head2 SavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts => L<Paws::ComputeOptimizer::RDSInstanceSavingsOpportunityAfterDiscounts>

Describes the savings opportunity for Amazon RDS recommendations or for
the recommendation option.

Savings opportunity represents the estimated monthly savings after
applying Savings Plans discounts. You can achieve this by implementing
a given Compute Optimizer recommendation.
