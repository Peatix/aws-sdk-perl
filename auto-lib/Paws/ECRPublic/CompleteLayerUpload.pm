=head1 NAME

Paws::ECRPublic::CompleteLayerUpload - Arguments for method CompleteLayerUpload on L<Paws::ECRPublic>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CompleteLayerUpload on the
L<Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public|Paws::ECRPublic> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CompleteLayerUpload.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CompleteLayerUpload.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.ecr-public = Paws->service('ECRPublic');
    my $CompleteLayerUploadResponse = $api . ecr-public->CompleteLayerUpload(
      LayerDigests   => [ 'MyLayerDigest', ... ],
      RepositoryName => 'MyRepositoryName',
      UploadId       => 'MyUploadId',
      RegistryId     => 'MyRegistryIdOrAlias',      # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LayerDigest    = $CompleteLayerUploadResponse->LayerDigest;
    my $RegistryId     = $CompleteLayerUploadResponse->RegistryId;
    my $RepositoryName = $CompleteLayerUploadResponse->RepositoryName;
    my $UploadId       = $CompleteLayerUploadResponse->UploadId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECRPublic::CompleteLayerUploadResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/api.ecr-public/CompleteLayerUpload>
