=head1 NAME

Paws::ECRPublic::DescribeRepositories - Arguments for method DescribeRepositories on L<Paws::ECRPublic>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeRepositories on the
L<Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public|Paws::ECRPublic> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeRepositories.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeRepositories.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.ecr-public = Paws->service('ECRPublic');
    my $DescribeRepositoriesResponse = $api . ecr-public->DescribeRepositories(
      MaxResults      => 1,                 # OPTIONAL
      NextToken       => 'MyNextToken',     # OPTIONAL
      RegistryId      => 'MyRegistryId',    # OPTIONAL
      RepositoryNames => [
        'MyRepositoryName', ...             # min: 2, max: 205
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken    = $DescribeRepositoriesResponse->NextToken;
    my $Repositories = $DescribeRepositoriesResponse->Repositories;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECRPublic::DescribeRepositoriesResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of repository results that's returned by
C<DescribeRepositories> in paginated output. When this parameter is
used, C<DescribeRepositories> only returns C<maxResults> results in a
single page along with a C<nextToken> response element. You can see the
remaining results of the initial request by sending another
C<DescribeRepositories> request with the returned C<nextToken> value.
This value can be between 1 and 1000. If this parameter isn't used,
then C<DescribeRepositories> returns up to 100 results and a
C<nextToken> value, if applicable. If you specify repositories with
C<repositoryNames>, you can't use this option.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The C<nextToken> value that's returned from a previous paginated
C<DescribeRepositories> request where C<maxResults> was used and the
results exceeded the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from
the end of the previous results that returned the C<nextToken> value.
If there are no more results to return, this value is C<null>. If you
specify repositories with C<repositoryNames>, you can't use this
option.

This token should be treated as an opaque identifier that is only used
to retrieve the next items in a list and not for other programmatic
purposes.



=head2 RegistryId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID that's associated with the registry
that contains the repositories to be described. If you do not specify a
registry, the default public registry is assumed.



=head2 RepositoryNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of repositories to describe. If this parameter is omitted, then
all repositories in a registry are described.
