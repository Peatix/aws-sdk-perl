=head1 NAME

Paws::ECRPublic::RegistryAlias

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECRPublic::RegistryAlias object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefaultRegistryAlias => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECRPublic::RegistryAlias object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefaultRegistryAlias

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the aliases for a public registry. A public
registry is given an alias when it's created. However, a custom alias
can be set using the Amazon ECR console. For more information, see
Registries
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Registry User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultRegistryAlias => Bool

Indicates whether the registry alias is the default alias for the
registry. When the first public repository is created, your public
registry is assigned a default registry alias.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the registry alias.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryRegistryAlias => Bool

Indicates whether the registry alias is the primary alias for the
registry. If true, the alias is the primary registry alias and is
displayed in both the repository URL and the image URI used in the
C<docker pull> commands on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery.

A registry alias that isn't the primary registry alias can be used in
the repository URI in a C<docker pull> command.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of the registry alias.
