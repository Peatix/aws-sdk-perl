=head1 NAME

Paws::ECRPublic::DeleteRepository - Arguments for method DeleteRepository on L<Paws::ECRPublic>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteRepository on the
L<Amazon Elastic Container Registry Public|Paws::ECRPublic> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteRepository.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteRepository.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.ecr-public = Paws->service('ECRPublic');
    my $DeleteRepositoryResponse = $api . ecr-public->DeleteRepository(
      RepositoryName => 'MyRepositoryName',
      Force          => 1,                    # OPTIONAL
      RegistryId     => 'MyRegistryId',       # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Repository = $DeleteRepositoryResponse->Repository;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ECRPublic::DeleteRepositoryResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/api.ecr-public/DeleteRepository>
