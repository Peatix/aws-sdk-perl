=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyARN => $value, ..., KeyType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the type and Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK to use for
Server-Side Encryption (SSE).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KeyARN => Str

If you set C<KeyType> to C<CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK>, you must specify the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK. If you set C<KeyType> to
C<Amazon Web Services_OWNED_CMK>, Firehose uses a service-account CMK.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyType => Str

Indicates the type of customer master key (CMK) to use for encryption.
The default setting is C<Amazon Web Services_OWNED_CMK>. For more
information about CMKs, see Customer Master Keys (CMKs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys).
When you invoke CreateDeliveryStream or StartDeliveryStreamEncryption
with C<KeyType> set to CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK, Firehose invokes the
Amazon KMS operation CreateGrant
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGrant.html)
to create a grant that allows the Firehose service to use the customer
managed CMK to perform encryption and decryption. Firehose manages that
grant.

When you invoke StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to change the CMK for a
Firehose stream that is encrypted with a customer managed CMK, Firehose
schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement.

You can use a CMK of type CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK to encrypt up to 500
Firehose streams. If a CreateDeliveryStream or
StartDeliveryStreamEncryption operation exceeds this limit, Firehose
throws a C<LimitExceededException>.

To encrypt your Firehose stream, use symmetric CMKs. Firehose doesn't
support asymmetric CMKs. For information about symmetric and asymmetric
CMKs, see About Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html)
in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service developer guide.
