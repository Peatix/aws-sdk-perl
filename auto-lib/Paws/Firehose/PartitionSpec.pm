=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::PartitionSpec

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::PartitionSpec object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identity => $value, ..., Identity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::PartitionSpec object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents how to produce partition data for a table. Partition data is
produced by transforming columns in a table. Each column transform is
represented by a named C<PartitionField>.

Here is an example of the schema in JSON.

C<"partitionSpec": { "identity": [ {"sourceName": "column1"},
{"sourceName": "column2"}, {"sourceName": "column3"} ] }>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Identity => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Firehose::PartitionField>]

List of identity transforms
(https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-transforms) that performs
an identity transformation. The transform takes the source value, and
does not modify it. Result type is the source type.
