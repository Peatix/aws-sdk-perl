=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BufferingHints => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BufferingHints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration of a destination in Amazon OpenSearch
Service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BufferingHints => L<Paws::Firehose::ElasticsearchBufferingHints>

The buffering options. If no value is specified, the default values for
C<ElasticsearchBufferingHints> are used.


=head2 CloudWatchLoggingOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::CloudWatchLoggingOptions>

The Amazon CloudWatch logging options for your Firehose stream.


=head2 ClusterEndpoint => Str

The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either
this C<ClusterEndpoint> or the C<DomainARN> field.


=head2 DocumentIdOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions>

Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods
are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated
document ID.


=head2 DomainARN => Str

The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role must have
permissions for C<DescribeDomain>, C<DescribeDomains>, and
C<DescribeDomainConfig> after assuming the role specified in
B<RoleARN>. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and
Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).

Specify either C<ClusterEndpoint> or C<DomainARN>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IndexName => Str

The Elasticsearch index name.


=head2 IndexRotationPeriod => Str

The Elasticsearch index rotation period. Index rotation appends a
timestamp to the C<IndexName> to facilitate the expiration of old data.
For more information, see Index Rotation for the Amazon OpenSearch
Service Destination
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-deliver.html#es-index-rotation).
The default value is C<OneDay>.


=head2 ProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::ProcessingConfiguration>

The data processing configuration.


=head2 RetryOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::ElasticsearchRetryOptions>

The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to
Amazon OpenSearch Service. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by
Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration API
and for indexing documents. For more information, see Grant Firehose
Access to an Amazon S3 Destination
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3)
and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service
Namespaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).


=head2 S3BackupMode => Str

Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When it is set
to C<FailedDocumentsOnly>, Firehose writes any documents that could not
be indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destination, with
C<AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/> appended to the key prefix. When set
to C<AllDocuments>, Firehose delivers all incoming records to Amazon
S3, and also writes failed documents with
C<AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/> appended to the prefix. For more
information, see Amazon S3 Backup for the Amazon OpenSearch Service
Destination
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-deliver.html#es-s3-backup).
Default value is C<FailedDocumentsOnly>.

You can't change this backup mode after you create the Firehose stream.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Configuration => L<Paws::Firehose::S3DestinationConfiguration>

The configuration for the backup Amazon S3 location.


=head2 TypeName => Str

The Elasticsearch type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there can be only
one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an existing
index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error during
run time.

For Elasticsearch 7.x, don't specify a C<TypeName>.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::VpcConfiguration>

The details of the VPC of the Amazon destination.
