=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BufferingHints => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BufferingHints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration of a destination in Amazon OpenSearch
Service

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BufferingHints => L<Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceBufferingHints>

The buffering options. If no value is specified, the default values for
AmazonopensearchserviceBufferingHints are used.


=head2 CloudWatchLoggingOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::CloudWatchLoggingOptions>




=head2 ClusterEndpoint => Str

The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either
this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.


=head2 DocumentIdOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions>

Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods
are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated
document ID.


=head2 DomainARN => Str

The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role must have
permissions for DescribeElasticsearchDomain,
DescribeElasticsearchDomains, and DescribeElasticsearchDomainConfig
after assuming the role specified in RoleARN.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IndexName => Str

The ElasticsearAmazon OpenSearch Service index name.


=head2 IndexRotationPeriod => Str

The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period. Index rotation
appends a timestamp to the IndexName to facilitate the expiration of
old data.


=head2 ProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::ProcessingConfiguration>




=head2 RetryOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceRetryOptions>

The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to
Amazon OpenSearch Service. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by
Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration API
and for indexing documents.


=head2 S3BackupMode => Str

Defines how documents should be delivered to Amazon S3. When it is set
to FailedDocumentsOnly, Firehose writes any documents that could not be
indexed to the configured Amazon S3 destination, with
AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/ appended to the key prefix. When set to
AllDocuments, Firehose delivers all incoming records to Amazon S3, and
also writes failed documents with AmazonOpenSearchService-failed/
appended to the prefix.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Configuration => L<Paws::Firehose::S3DestinationConfiguration>




=head2 TypeName => Str

The Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there
can be only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an
existing index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error
during run time.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::VpcConfiguration>
