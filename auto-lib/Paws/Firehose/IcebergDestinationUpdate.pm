=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::IcebergDestinationUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::IcebergDestinationUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppendOnly => $value, ..., TableCreationConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::IcebergDestinationUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppendOnly

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an update for a destination in Apache Iceberg Tables.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AppendOnly => Bool

Describes whether all incoming data for this delivery stream will be
append only (inserts only and not for updates and deletes) for Iceberg
delivery. This feature is only applicable for Apache Iceberg Tables.

The default value is false. If you set this value to true, Firehose
automatically increases the throughput limit of a stream based on the
throttling levels of the stream. If you set this parameter to true for
a stream with updates and deletes, you will see out of order delivery.


=head2 BufferingHints => L<Paws::Firehose::BufferingHints>




=head2 CatalogConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::CatalogConfiguration>

Configuration describing where the destination Iceberg tables are
persisted.


=head2 CloudWatchLoggingOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::CloudWatchLoggingOptions>




=head2 DestinationTableConfigurationList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Firehose::DestinationTableConfiguration>]

Provides a list of C<DestinationTableConfigurations> which Firehose
uses to deliver data to Apache Iceberg Tables. Firehose will write data
with insert if table specific configuration is not provided here.


=head2 ProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::ProcessingConfiguration>




=head2 RetryOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::RetryOptions>




=head2 RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by
Firehose for calling Apache Iceberg Tables.


=head2 S3BackupMode => Str

Describes how Firehose will backup records. Currently,Firehose only
supports C<FailedDataOnly>.


=head2 S3Configuration => L<Paws::Firehose::S3DestinationConfiguration>




=head2 SchemaEvolutionConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::SchemaEvolutionConfiguration>

The configuration to enable automatic schema evolution.

Amazon Data Firehose is in preview release and is subject to change.


=head2 TableCreationConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::TableCreationConfiguration>

The configuration to enable automatic table creation.

Amazon Data Firehose is in preview release and is subject to change.
