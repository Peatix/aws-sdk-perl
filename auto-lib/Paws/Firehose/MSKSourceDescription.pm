Paws::Firehose::MSKSourceDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::MSKSourceDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthenticationConfiguration => $value, ..., TopicName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::MSKSourceDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthenticationConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about the Amazon MSK cluster used as the source for a Firehose
stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthenticationConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::AuthenticationConfiguration>

The authentication configuration of the Amazon MSK cluster.


=head2 DeliveryStartTimestamp => Str

Firehose starts retrieving records from the topic within the Amazon MSK
cluster starting with this timestamp.


=head2 MSKClusterARN => Str

The ARN of the Amazon MSK cluster.


=head2 ReadFromTimestamp => Str

The start date and time in UTC for the offset position within your MSK
topic from where Firehose begins to read. By default, this is set to
timestamp when Firehose becomes Active.

If you want to create a Firehose stream with Earliest start position
from SDK or CLI, you need to set the C<ReadFromTimestampUTC> parameter
to Epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).


=head2 TopicName => Str

The topic name within the Amazon MSK cluster.



=head1 SEE ALSO
