=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::SchemaConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::SchemaConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CatalogId => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::SchemaConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CatalogId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the schema to which you want Firehose to configure your data
before it writes it to Amazon S3. This parameter is required if
C<Enabled> is set to true.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CatalogId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Web Services Glue Data Catalog. If you don't
supply this, the Amazon Web Services account ID is used by default.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

Specifies the name of the Amazon Web Services Glue database that
contains the schema for the output data.

If the C<SchemaConfiguration> request parameter is used as part of
invoking the C<CreateDeliveryStream> API, then the C<DatabaseName>
property is required and its value must be specified.


=head2 Region => Str

If you don't specify an Amazon Web Services Region, the default is the
current Region.


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The role that Firehose can use to access Amazon Web Services Glue. This
role must be in the same account you use for Firehose. Cross-account
roles aren't allowed.

If the C<SchemaConfiguration> request parameter is used as part of
invoking the C<CreateDeliveryStream> API, then the C<RoleARN> property
is required and its value must be specified.


=head2 TableName => Str

Specifies the Amazon Web Services Glue table that contains the column
information that constitutes your data schema.

If the C<SchemaConfiguration> request parameter is used as part of
invoking the C<CreateDeliveryStream> API, then the C<TableName>
property is required and its value must be specified.


=head2 VersionId => Str

Specifies the table version for the output data schema. If you don't
specify this version ID, or if you set it to C<LATEST>, Firehose uses
the most recent version. This means that any updates to the table are
automatically picked up.
