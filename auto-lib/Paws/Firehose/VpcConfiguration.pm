=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::VpcConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::VpcConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RoleARN => $value, ..., SubnetIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::VpcConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RoleARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch or Amazon OpenSearch
Serverless destination.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleARN => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that you want the Firehose stream to use to
create endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use your existing
Firehose delivery role or you can specify a new role. In either case,
make sure that the role trusts the Firehose service principal and that
it grants the following permissions:

When you specify subnets for delivering data to the destination in a
private VPC, make sure you have enough number of free IP addresses in
chosen subnets. If there is no available free IP address in a specified
subnet, Firehose cannot create or add ENIs for the data delivery in the
private VPC, and the delivery will be degraded or fail.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the security groups that you want Firehose to use when it
creates ENIs in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination.
You can use the same security group that the Amazon OpenSearch Service
domain uses or different ones. If you specify different security groups
here, ensure that they allow outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon
OpenSearch Service domain's security group. Also ensure that the Amazon
OpenSearch Service domain's security group allows HTTPS traffic from
the security groups specified here. If you use the same security group
for both your delivery stream and the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain,
make sure the security group inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For
more information about security group rules, see Security group rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules)
in the Amazon VPC documentation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the subnets that you want Firehose to use to create ENIs in
the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. Make sure that
the routing tables and inbound and outbound rules allow traffic to flow
from the subnets whose IDs are specified here to the subnets that have
the destination Amazon OpenSearch Service endpoints. Firehose creates
at least one ENI in each of the subnets that are specified here. Do not
delete or modify these ENIs.

The number of ENIs that Firehose creates in the subnets specified here
scales up and down automatically based on throughput. To enable
Firehose to scale up the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure
that you have sufficient quota. To help you calculate the quota you
need, assume that Firehose can create up to three ENIs for this
Firehose stream for each of the subnets specified here. For more
information about ENI quota, see Network Interfaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-enis)
in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.
