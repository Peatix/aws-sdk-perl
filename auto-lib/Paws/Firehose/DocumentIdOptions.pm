=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefaultDocumentIdFormat => $value, ..., DefaultDocumentIdFormat => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefaultDocumentIdFormat

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods
are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated
document ID.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultDocumentIdFormat => Str

When the C<FIREHOSE_DEFAULT> option is chosen, Firehose generates a
unique document ID for each record based on a unique internal
identifier. The generated document ID is stable across multiple
delivery attempts, which helps prevent the same record from being
indexed multiple times with different document IDs.

When the C<NO_DOCUMENT_ID> option is chosen, Firehose does not include
any document IDs in the requests it sends to the Amazon OpenSearch
Service. This causes the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain to generate
document IDs. In case of multiple delivery attempts, this may cause the
same record to be indexed more than once with different document IDs.
This option enables write-heavy operations, such as the ingestion of
logs and observability data, to consume less resources in the Amazon
OpenSearch Service domain, resulting in improved performance.
