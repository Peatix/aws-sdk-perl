=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::VpcConfigurationDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::VpcConfigurationDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RoleARN => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::VpcConfigurationDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RoleARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleARN => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that the Firehose stream uses to create
endpoints in the destination VPC. You can use your existing Firehose
delivery role or you can specify a new role. In either case, make sure
that the role trusts the Firehose service principal and that it grants
the following permissions:

If you revoke these permissions after you create the Firehose stream,
Firehose can't scale out by creating more ENIs when necessary. You
might therefore see a degradation in performance.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the security groups that Firehose uses when it creates ENIs
in the VPC of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. You can use
the same security group that the Amazon ES domain uses or different
ones. If you specify different security groups, ensure that they allow
outbound HTTPS traffic to the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's
security group. Also ensure that the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain's
security group allows HTTPS traffic from the security groups specified
here. If you use the same security group for both your Firehose stream
and the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, make sure the security group
inbound rule allows HTTPS traffic. For more information about security
group rules, see Security group rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#SecurityGroupRules)
in the Amazon VPC documentation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the subnets that Firehose uses to create ENIs in the VPC of
the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination. Make sure that the routing
tables and inbound and outbound rules allow traffic to flow from the
subnets whose IDs are specified here to the subnets that have the
destination Amazon OpenSearch Service endpoints. Firehose creates at
least one ENI in each of the subnets that are specified here. Do not
delete or modify these ENIs.

The number of ENIs that Firehose creates in the subnets specified here
scales up and down automatically based on throughput. To enable
Firehose to scale up the number of ENIs to match throughput, ensure
that you have sufficient quota. To help you calculate the quota you
need, assume that Firehose can create up to three ENIs for this
Firehose stream for each of the subnets specified here. For more
information about ENI quota, see Network Interfaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html#vpc-limits-enis)
in the Amazon VPC Quotas topic.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VpcId => Str

The ID of the Amazon OpenSearch Service destination's VPC.
