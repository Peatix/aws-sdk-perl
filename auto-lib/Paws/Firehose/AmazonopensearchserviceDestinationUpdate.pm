=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BufferingHints => $value, ..., TypeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceDestinationUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BufferingHints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an update for a destination in Amazon OpenSearch Service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BufferingHints => L<Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceBufferingHints>

The buffering options. If no value is specified,
AmazonopensearchBufferingHints object default values are used.


=head2 CloudWatchLoggingOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::CloudWatchLoggingOptions>




=head2 ClusterEndpoint => Str

The endpoint to use when communicating with the cluster. Specify either
this ClusterEndpoint or the DomainARN field.


=head2 DocumentIdOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::DocumentIdOptions>

Indicates the method for setting up document ID. The supported methods
are Firehose generated document ID and OpenSearch Service generated
document ID.


=head2 DomainARN => Str

The ARN of the Amazon OpenSearch Service domain. The IAM role must have
permissions for DescribeDomain, DescribeDomains, and
DescribeDomainConfig after assuming the IAM role specified in RoleARN.


=head2 IndexName => Str

The Amazon OpenSearch Service index name.


=head2 IndexRotationPeriod => Str

The Amazon OpenSearch Service index rotation period. Index rotation
appends a timestamp to IndexName to facilitate the expiration of old
data.


=head2 ProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::ProcessingConfiguration>




=head2 RetryOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::AmazonopensearchserviceRetryOptions>

The retry behavior in case Firehose is unable to deliver documents to
Amazon OpenSearch Service. The default value is 300 (5 minutes).


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be assumed by
Firehose for calling the Amazon OpenSearch Service Configuration API
and for indexing documents.


=head2 S3Update => L<Paws::Firehose::S3DestinationUpdate>




=head2 TypeName => Str

The Amazon OpenSearch Service type name. For Elasticsearch 6.x, there
can be only one type per index. If you try to specify a new type for an
existing index that already has another type, Firehose returns an error
during runtime.

If you upgrade Elasticsearch from 6.x to 7.x and donE<rsquo>t update
your Firehose stream, Firehose still delivers data to Elasticsearch
with the old index name and type name. If you want to update your
Firehose stream with a new index name, provide an empty string for
TypeName.
