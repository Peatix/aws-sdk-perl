=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeDestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeDestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountUrl => $value, ..., User => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeDestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountUrl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configure Snowflake destination

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccountUrl => Str

URL for accessing your Snowflake account. This URL must include your
account identifier
(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier).
Note that the protocol (https://) and port number are optional.


=head2 BufferingHints => L<Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeBufferingHints>

Describes the buffering to perform before delivering data to the
Snowflake destination. If you do not specify any value, Firehose uses
the default values.


=head2 CloudWatchLoggingOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::CloudWatchLoggingOptions>




=head2 ContentColumnName => Str

The name of the record content column.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Database => Str

All data in Snowflake is maintained in databases.


=head2 DataLoadingOption => Str

Choose to load JSON keys mapped to table column names or choose to
split the JSON payload where content is mapped to a record content
column and source metadata is mapped to a record metadata column.


=head2 KeyPassphrase => Str

Passphrase to decrypt the private key when the key is encrypted. For
information, see Using Key Pair Authentication & Key Rotation
(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-configuration#using-key-pair-authentication-key-rotation).


=head2 MetaDataColumnName => Str

Specify a column name in the table, where the metadata information has
to be loaded. When you enable this field, you will see the following
column in the snowflake table, which differs based on the source type.

For Direct PUT as source

C<{ "firehoseDeliveryStreamName" : "streamname", "IngestionTime" :
"timestamp" }>

For Kinesis Data Stream as source

C<"kinesisStreamName" : "streamname", "kinesisShardId" : "Id",
"kinesisPartitionKey" : "key", "kinesisSequenceNumber" : "1234",
"subsequenceNumber" : "2334", "IngestionTime" : "timestamp" }>


=head2 PrivateKey => Str

The private key used to encrypt your Snowflake client. For information,
see Using Key Pair Authentication & Key Rotation
(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-streaming-configuration#using-key-pair-authentication-key-rotation).


=head2 ProcessingConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::ProcessingConfiguration>




=head2 RetryOptions => L<Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeRetryOptions>

The time period where Firehose will retry sending data to the chosen
HTTP endpoint.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Snowflake role


=head2 S3BackupMode => Str

Choose an S3 backup mode


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Configuration => L<Paws::Firehose::S3DestinationConfiguration>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Schema => Str

Each database consists of one or more schemas, which are logical
groupings of database objects, such as tables and views


=head2 SecretsManagerConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::SecretsManagerConfiguration>

The configuration that defines how you access secrets for Snowflake.


=head2 SnowflakeRoleConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeRoleConfiguration>

Optionally configure a Snowflake role. Otherwise the default user role
will be used.


=head2 SnowflakeVpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Firehose::SnowflakeVpcConfiguration>

The VPCE ID for Firehose to privately connect with Snowflake. The ID
format is com.amazonaws.vpce.[region].vpce-svc-E<lt>[id]E<gt>. For more
information, see Amazon PrivateLink & Snowflake
(https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-security-privatelink)


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Table => Str

All data in Snowflake is stored in database tables, logically
structured as collections of columns and rows.


=head2 User => Str

User login name for the Snowflake account.
