=head1 NAME

Paws::Firehose::SecretsManagerConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Firehose::SecretsManagerConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., SecretARN => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Firehose::SecretsManagerConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure that defines how Firehose accesses the secret.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Specifies whether you want to use the secrets manager feature. When set
as C<True> the secrets manager configuration overwrites the existing
secrets in the destination configuration. When it's set to C<False>
Firehose falls back to the credentials in the destination
configuration.


=head2 RoleARN => Str

Specifies the role that Firehose assumes when calling the Secrets
Manager API operation. When you provide the role, it overrides any
destination specific role defined in the destination configuration. If
you do not provide the then we use the destination specific role. This
parameter is required for Splunk.


=head2 SecretARN => Str

The ARN of the secret that stores your credentials. It must be in the
same region as the Firehose stream and the role. The secret ARN can
reside in a different account than the Firehose stream and role as
Firehose supports cross-account secret access. This parameter is
required when B<Enabled> is set to C<True>.
