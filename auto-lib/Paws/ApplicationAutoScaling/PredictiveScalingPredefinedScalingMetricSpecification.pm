=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetricSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetricSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PredefinedMetricType => $value, ..., ResourceLabel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPredefinedScalingMetricSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PredefinedMetricType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a scaling metric for a predictive scaling policy.

When returned in the output of C<DescribePolicies>, it indicates that a
predictive scaling policy uses individually specified load and scaling
metrics instead of a metric pair.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PredefinedMetricType => Str

The metric type.


=head2 ResourceLabel => Str

A label that uniquely identifies a specific target group from which to
determine the average request count.
