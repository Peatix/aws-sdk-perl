=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingMetricStat

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingMetricStat object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Metric => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingMetricStat object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Metric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure defines the CloudWatch metric to return, along with the
statistic and unit.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metric => L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingMetric>

The CloudWatch metric to return, including the metric name, namespace,
and dimensions. To get the exact metric name, namespace, and
dimensions, inspect the Metric
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_Metric.html)
object that is returned by a call to ListMetrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_ListMetrics.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Stat => Str

The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or
extended statistic. For a list of valid values, see the table in
Statistics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Statistic)
in the I<Amazon CloudWatch User Guide>.

The most commonly used metrics for predictive scaling are C<Average>
and C<Sum>.


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit to use for the returned data points. For a complete list of
the units that CloudWatch supports, see the MetricDatum
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html)
data type in the I<Amazon CloudWatch API Reference>.
