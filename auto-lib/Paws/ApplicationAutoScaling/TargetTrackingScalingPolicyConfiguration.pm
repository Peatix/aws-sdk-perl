=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomizedMetricSpecification => $value, ..., TargetValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomizedMetricSpecification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a target tracking scaling policy configuration to use with
Application Auto Scaling.

For more information, see Target tracking scaling policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html)
in the I<Application Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomizedMetricSpecification => L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::CustomizedMetricSpecification>

A customized metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a
customized metric.


=head2 DisableScaleIn => Bool

Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy is
disabled. If the value is C<true>, scale in is disabled and the target
tracking scaling policy won't remove capacity from the scalable target.
Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target tracking scaling policy
can remove capacity from the scalable target. The default value is
C<false>.


=head2 PredefinedMetricSpecification => L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredefinedMetricSpecification>

A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined metric or a
customized metric.


=head2 ScaleInCooldown => Int

The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in activity completes
before another scale-in activity can start. For more information and
for default values, see Define cooldown periods
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/target-tracking-scaling-policy-overview.html#target-tracking-cooldown)
in the I<Application Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 ScaleOutCooldown => Int

The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scale-out
activity to take effect. For more information and for default values,
see Define cooldown periods
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/target-tracking-scaling-policy-overview.html#target-tracking-cooldown)
in the I<Application Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetValue => Num

The target value for the metric. Although this property accepts numbers
of type Double, it won't accept values that are either too small or too
large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to 2^360. The value must
be a valid number based on the choice of metric. For example, if the
metric is CPU utilization, then the target value is a percent value
that represents how much of the CPU can be used before scaling out.

If the scaling policy specifies the C<ALBRequestCountPerTarget>
predefined metric, specify the target utilization as the optimal
average request count per target during any one-minute interval.
