=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalingPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalingPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Alarms => $value, ..., TargetTrackingScalingPolicyConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalingPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Alarms

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a scaling policy to use with Application Auto Scaling.

For more information about configuring scaling policies for a specific
service, see Amazon Web Services services that you can use with
Application Auto Scaling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/integrated-services-list.html)
in the I<Application Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Alarms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::Alarm>]
