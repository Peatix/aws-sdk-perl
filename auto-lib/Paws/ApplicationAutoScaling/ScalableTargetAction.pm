=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalableTargetAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalableTargetAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacity => $value, ..., MinCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::ScalableTargetAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the minimum and maximum capacity for a scheduled action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Int

The maximum capacity.

Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service
quotas may impose lower limits. Each service has its own default quotas
for the maximum capacity of the resource. If you want to specify a
higher limit, you can request an increase. For more information,
consult the documentation for that service. For information about the
default quotas for each service, see Service endpoints and quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.


=head2 MinCapacity => Int

The minimum capacity.

When the scheduled action runs, the resource will have at least this
much capacity, but it might have more depending on other settings, such
as the target utilization level of a target tracking scaling policy.
