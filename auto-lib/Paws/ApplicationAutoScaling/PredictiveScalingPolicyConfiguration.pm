=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPolicyConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacityBreachBehavior => $value, ..., SchedulingBufferTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingPolicyConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacityBreachBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a predictive scaling policy configuration. Predictive
scaling is supported on Amazon ECS services.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacityBreachBehavior => Str

Defines the behavior that should be applied if the forecast capacity
approaches or exceeds the maximum capacity. Defaults to
C<HonorMaxCapacity> if not specified.


=head2 MaxCapacityBuffer => Int

The size of the capacity buffer to use when the forecast capacity is
close to or exceeds the maximum capacity. The value is specified as a
percentage relative to the forecast capacity. For example, if the
buffer is 10, this means a 10 percent buffer, such that if the forecast
capacity is 50, and the maximum capacity is 40, then the effective
maximum capacity is 55.

Required if the C<MaxCapacityBreachBehavior> property is set to
C<IncreaseMaxCapacity>, and cannot be used otherwise.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricSpecifications => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::PredictiveScalingMetricSpecification>]

This structure includes the metrics and target utilization to use for
predictive scaling.

This is an array, but we currently only support a single metric
specification. That is, you can specify a target value and a single
metric pair, or a target value and one scaling metric and one load
metric.


=head2 Mode => Str

The predictive scaling mode. Defaults to C<ForecastOnly> if not
specified.


=head2 SchedulingBufferTime => Int

The amount of time, in seconds, that the start time can be advanced.

The value must be less than the forecast interval duration of 3600
seconds (60 minutes). Defaults to 300 seconds if not specified.
