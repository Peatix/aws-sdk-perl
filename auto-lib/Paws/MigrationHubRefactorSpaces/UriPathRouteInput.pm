=head1 NAME

Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::UriPathRouteInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::UriPathRouteInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivationState => $value, ..., SourcePath => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::UriPathRouteInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivationState

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the URI path route type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActivationState => Str

If set to C<ACTIVE>, traffic is forwarded to this routeE<rsquo>s
service after the route is created.


=head2 AppendSourcePath => Bool

If set to C<true>, this option appends the source path to the service
URL endpoint.


=head2 IncludeChildPaths => Bool

Indicates whether to match all subpaths of the given source path. If
this value is C<false>, requests must match the source path exactly
before they are forwarded to this route's service.


=head2 Methods => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of HTTP methods to match. An empty list matches all values. If a
method is present, only HTTP requests using that method are forwarded
to this routeE<rsquo>s service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourcePath => Str

This is the path that Refactor Spaces uses to match traffic. Paths must
start with C</> and are relative to the base of the application. To use
path parameters in the source path, add a variable in curly braces. For
example, the resource path {user} represents a path parameter called
'user'.
