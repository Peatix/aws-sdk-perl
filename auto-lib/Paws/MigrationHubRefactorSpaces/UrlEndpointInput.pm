Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::UrlEndpointInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HealthUrl => $value, ..., Url => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::UrlEndpointInput object:

The configuration for the URL endpoint type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HealthUrl => Str

The health check URL of the URL endpoint type. If the URL is a public
endpoint, the C<HealthUrl> must also be a public endpoint. If the URL
is a private endpoint inside a virtual private cloud (VPC), the health
URL must also be a private endpoint, and the host must be the same as
the URL.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Url => Str

The URL to route traffic to. The URL must be an rfc3986-formatted URL
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986). If the host is a
domain name, the name must be resolvable over the public internet. If
the scheme is C<https>, the top level domain of the host must be listed
in the IANA root zone database (https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).
