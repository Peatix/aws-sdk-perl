=head1 NAME

Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::ApiGatewayProxyInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::ApiGatewayProxyInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointType => $value, ..., StageName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MigrationHubRefactorSpaces::ApiGatewayProxyInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A wrapper object holding the Amazon API Gateway endpoint input.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndpointType => Str

The type of endpoint to use for the API Gateway proxy. If no value is
specified in the request, the value is set to C<REGIONAL> by default.

If the value is set to C<PRIVATE> in the request, this creates a
private API endpoint that is isolated from the public internet. The
private endpoint can only be accessed by using Amazon Virtual Private
Cloud (Amazon VPC) interface endpoints for the Amazon API Gateway that
has been granted access. For more information about creating a private
connection with Refactor Spaces and interface endpoint (Amazon Web
Services PrivateLink) availability, see Access Refactor Spaces using an
interface endpoint (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub-refactor-spaces/latest/userguide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html).


=head2 StageName => Str

The name of the API Gateway stage. The name defaults to C<prod>.
