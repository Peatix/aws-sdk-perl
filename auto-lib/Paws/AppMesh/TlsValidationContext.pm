=head1 NAME

Paws::AppMesh::TlsValidationContext

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppMesh::TlsValidationContext object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SubjectAlternativeNames => $value, ..., Trust => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppMesh::TlsValidationContext object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SubjectAlternativeNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents how the proxy will validate its peer during
Transport Layer Security (TLS) negotiation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SubjectAlternativeNames => L<Paws::AppMesh::SubjectAlternativeNames>

A reference to an object that represents the SANs for a Transport Layer
Security (TLS) validation context. If you don't specify SANs on the
I<terminating> mesh endpoint, the Envoy proxy for that node doesn't
verify the SAN on a peer client certificate. If you don't specify SANs
on the I<originating> mesh endpoint, the SAN on the certificate
provided by the terminating endpoint must match the mesh endpoint
service discovery configuration. Since SPIRE vended certificates have a
SPIFFE ID as a name, you must set the SAN since the name doesn't match
the service discovery name.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Trust => L<Paws::AppMesh::TlsValidationContextTrust>

A reference to where to retrieve the trust chain when validating a
peerE<rsquo>s Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate.
