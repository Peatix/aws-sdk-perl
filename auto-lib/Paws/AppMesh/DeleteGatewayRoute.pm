=head1 NAME

Paws::AppMesh::DeleteGatewayRoute - Arguments for method DeleteGatewayRoute on L<Paws::AppMesh>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteGatewayRoute on the
L<AWS App Mesh|Paws::AppMesh> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteGatewayRoute.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteGatewayRoute.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appmesh = Paws->service('AppMesh');
    my $DeleteGatewayRouteOutput = $appmesh->DeleteGatewayRoute(
      GatewayRouteName   => 'MyResourceName',
      MeshName           => 'MyResourceName',
      VirtualGatewayName => 'MyResourceName',
      MeshOwner          => 'MyAccountId',      # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GatewayRoute = $DeleteGatewayRouteOutput->GatewayRoute;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppMesh::DeleteGatewayRouteOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/appmesh/DeleteGatewayRoute>
