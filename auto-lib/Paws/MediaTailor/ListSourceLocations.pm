=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::ListSourceLocations - Arguments for method ListSourceLocations on L<Paws::MediaTailor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListSourceLocations on the
L<AWS MediaTailor|Paws::MediaTailor> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListSourceLocations.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListSourceLocations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.mediatailor = Paws->service('MediaTailor');
    my $ListSourceLocationsResponse = $api . mediatailor->ListSourceLocations(
      MaxResults => 1,               # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'My__string',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Items     = $ListSourceLocationsResponse->Items;
    my $NextToken = $ListSourceLocationsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::MediaTailor::ListSourceLocationsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/api.mediatailor/ListSourceLocations>
