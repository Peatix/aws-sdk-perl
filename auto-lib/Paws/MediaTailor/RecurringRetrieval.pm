=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::RecurringRetrieval

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::RecurringRetrieval object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DelayAfterAvailEndSeconds => $value, ..., TrafficShapingType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::RecurringRetrieval object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DelayAfterAvailEndSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

With recurring prefetch, MediaTailor automatically prefetches ads for
every avail that occurs during the retrieval window. The following
configurations describe the MediaTailor behavior when prefetching ads
for a live event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DelayAfterAvailEndSeconds => Int

The number of seconds that MediaTailor waits after an ad avail before
prefetching ads for the next avail. If not set, the default is 0 (no
delay).


=head2 DynamicVariables => L<Paws::MediaTailor::__mapOf__string>

The dynamic variables to use for substitution during prefetch requests
to the ADS.


=head2 TrafficShapingRetrievalWindow => L<Paws::MediaTailor::TrafficShapingRetrievalWindow>

Configuration for spreading ADS traffic across a set window instead of
sending ADS requests for all sessions at the same time.


=head2 TrafficShapingType => Str

Indicates if this configuration uses a retrieval window for traffic
shaping and limiting the number of requests to the ADS at one time.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::MediaTailor>
