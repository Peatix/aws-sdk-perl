=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::SourceLocation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::SourceLocation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessConfiguration => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::SourceLocation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A source location is a container for sources. For more information
about source locations, see Working with source locations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/channel-assembly-source-locations.html)
in the I<MediaTailor User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::AccessConfiguration>

The access configuration for the source location.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The ARN of the SourceLocation.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The timestamp that indicates when the source location was created.


=head2 DefaultSegmentDeliveryConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::DefaultSegmentDeliveryConfiguration>

The default segment delivery configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> HttpConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::HttpConfiguration>

The HTTP configuration for the source location.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The timestamp that indicates when the source location was last
modified.


=head2 SegmentDeliveryConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaTailor::SegmentDeliveryConfiguration>]

The segment delivery configurations for the source location.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceLocationName => Str

The name of the source location.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::MediaTailor::__mapOf__string>

The tags assigned to the source location. Tags are key-value pairs that
you can associate with Amazon resources to help with organization,
access control, and cost tracking. For more information, see Tagging
AWS Elemental MediaTailor Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/tagging.html).
