=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::TimeSignalMessage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::TimeSignalMessage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SegmentationDescriptors => $value, ..., SegmentationDescriptors => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::TimeSignalMessage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SegmentationDescriptors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SCTE-35 C<time_signal> message can be sent with one or more
C<segmentation_descriptor> messages. A C<time_signal> message can be
sent only if a single C<segmentation_descriptor> message is sent.

The C<time_signal> message contains only the C<splice_time> field which
is constructed using a given presentation timestamp. When sending a
C<time_signal> message, the C<splice_command_type> field in the
C<splice_info_section> message is set to 6 (0x06).

See the C<time_signal()> table of the 2022 SCTE-35 specification for
more information.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SegmentationDescriptors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaTailor::SegmentationDescriptor>]

The configurations for the SCTE-35 C<segmentation_descriptor>
message(s) sent with the C<time_signal> message.
