=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::AvailMatchingCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::AvailMatchingCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DynamicVariable => $value, ..., Operator => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::AvailMatchingCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DynamicVariable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MediaTailor only places (consumes) prefetched ads if the ad break meets
the criteria defined by the dynamic variables. This gives you granular
control over which ad break to place the prefetched ads into.

As an example, let's say that you set C<DynamicVariable> to
C<scte.event_id> and C<Operator> to C<EQUALS>, and your playback
configuration has an ADS URL of
C<https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs]>.
And the prefetch request to the ADS contains these values
C<https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30>.
MediaTailor will only insert the prefetched ads into the ad break if
has a SCTE marker with an event id of C<my-awesome-event>, since it
must match the event id that MediaTailor uses to query the ADS.

You can specify up to five C<AvailMatchingCriteria>. If you specify
multiple C<AvailMatchingCriteria>, MediaTailor combines them to match
using a logical C<AND>. You can model logical C<OR> combinations by
creating multiple prefetch schedules.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DynamicVariable => Str

The dynamic variable(s) that MediaTailor should use as avail matching
criteria. MediaTailor only places the prefetched ads into the avail if
the avail matches the criteria defined by the dynamic variable. For
information about dynamic variables, see Using dynamic ad variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/variables.html) in
the I<MediaTailor User Guide>.

You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

For the C<DynamicVariable> specified in C<AvailMatchingCriteria>, the
Operator that is used for the comparison.
