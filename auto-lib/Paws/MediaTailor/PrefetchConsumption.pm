=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchConsumption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchConsumption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailMatchingCriteria => $value, ..., StartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchConsumption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailMatchingCriteria

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For single prefetch, describes how and when that MediaTailor places
prefetched ads into upcoming ad breaks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailMatchingCriteria => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaTailor::AvailMatchingCriteria>]

If you only want MediaTailor to insert prefetched ads into avails (ad
breaks) that match specific dynamic variables, such as
C<scte.event_id>, set the avail matching criteria.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndTime => Str

The time when MediaTailor no longer considers the prefetched ads for
use in an ad break. MediaTailor automatically deletes prefetch
schedules no less than seven days after the end time. If you'd like to
manually delete the prefetch schedule, you can call
C<DeletePrefetchSchedule>.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The time when prefetched ads are considered for use in an ad break. If
you don't specify C<StartTime>, the prefetched ads are available after
MediaTailor retrieves them from the ad decision server.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::MediaTailor>
