=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::PlaybackConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::PlaybackConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdConditioningConfiguration => $value, ..., VideoContentSourceUrl => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::PlaybackConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdConditioningConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A playback configuration. For information about MediaTailor
configurations, see Working with configurations in AWS Elemental
MediaTailor
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/configurations.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdConditioningConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::AdConditioningConfiguration>

The setting that indicates what conditioning MediaTailor will perform
on ads that the ad decision server (ADS) returns, and what priority
MediaTailor uses when inserting ads.


=head2 AdDecisionServerUrl => Str

The URL for the ad decision server (ADS). This includes the
specification of static parameters and placeholders for dynamic
parameters. AWS Elemental MediaTailor substitutes player-specific and
session-specific parameters as needed when calling the ADS.
Alternately, for testing you can provide a static VAST URL. The maximum
length is 25,000 characters.


=head2 AvailSuppression => L<Paws::MediaTailor::AvailSuppression>

The configuration for avail suppression, also known as ad suppression.
For more information about ad suppression, see Ad Suppression
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/ad-behavior.html).


=head2 Bumper => L<Paws::MediaTailor::Bumper>

The configuration for bumpers. Bumpers are short audio or video clips
that play at the start or before the end of an ad break. To learn more
about bumpers, see Bumpers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/bumpers.html).


=head2 CdnConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::CdnConfiguration>

The configuration for using a content delivery network (CDN), like
Amazon CloudFront, for content and ad segment management.


=head2 ConfigurationAliases => L<Paws::MediaTailor::ConfigurationAliasesResponse>

The player parameters and aliases used as dynamic variables during
session initialization. For more information, see Domain Variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/variables-domains.html).


=head2 DashConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::DashConfiguration>

The configuration for a DASH source.


=head2 HlsConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::HlsConfiguration>

The configuration for HLS content.


=head2 InsertionMode => Str

The setting that controls whether players can use stitched or guided ad
insertion. The default, C<STITCHED_ONLY>, forces all player sessions to
use stitched (server-side) ad insertion. Choosing C<PLAYER_SELECT>
allows players to select either stitched or guided ad insertion at
session-initialization time. The default for players that do not
specify an insertion mode is stitched.


=head2 LivePreRollConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::LivePreRollConfiguration>

The configuration for pre-roll ad insertion.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaTailor::LogConfiguration>

Defines where AWS Elemental MediaTailor sends logs for the playback
configuration.


=head2 ManifestProcessingRules => L<Paws::MediaTailor::ManifestProcessingRules>

The configuration for manifest processing rules. Manifest processing
rules enable customization of the personalized manifests created by
MediaTailor.


=head2 Name => Str

The identifier for the playback configuration.


=head2 PersonalizationThresholdSeconds => Int

Defines the maximum duration of underfilled ad time (in seconds)
allowed in an ad break. If the duration of underfilled ad time exceeds
the personalization threshold, then the personalization of the ad break
is abandoned and the underlying content is shown. This feature applies
to I<ad replacement> in live and VOD streams, rather than ad insertion,
because it relies on an underlying content stream. For more information
about ad break behavior, including ad replacement and insertion, see Ad
Behavior in AWS Elemental MediaTailor
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/ad-behavior.html).


=head2 PlaybackConfigurationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the playback configuration.


=head2 PlaybackEndpointPrefix => Str

The URL that the player accesses to get a manifest from AWS Elemental
MediaTailor.


=head2 SessionInitializationEndpointPrefix => Str

The URL that the player uses to initialize a session that uses
client-side reporting.


=head2 SlateAdUrl => Str

The URL for a video asset to transcode and use to fill in time that's
not used by ads. AWS Elemental MediaTailor shows the slate to fill in
gaps in media content. Configuring the slate is optional for non-VPAID
playback configurations. For VPAID, the slate is required because
MediaTailor provides it in the slots designated for dynamic ad content.
The slate must be a high-quality asset that contains both audio and
video.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::MediaTailor::__mapOf__string>

The tags to assign to the playback configuration. Tags are key-value
pairs that you can associate with Amazon resources to help with
organization, access control, and cost tracking. For more information,
see Tagging AWS Elemental MediaTailor Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/tagging.html).


=head2 TranscodeProfileName => Str

The name that is used to associate this playback configuration with a
custom transcode profile. This overrides the dynamic transcoding
defaults of MediaTailor. Use this only if you have already set up
custom profiles with the help of AWS Support.


=head2 VideoContentSourceUrl => Str

The URL prefix for the parent manifest for the stream, minus the asset
ID. The maximum length is 512 characters.
