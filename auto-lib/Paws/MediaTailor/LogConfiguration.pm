=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::LogConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::LogConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdsInteractionLog => $value, ..., PercentEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::LogConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdsInteractionLog

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines where AWS Elemental MediaTailor sends logs for the playback
configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdsInteractionLog => L<Paws::MediaTailor::AdsInteractionLog>

Settings for customizing what events are included in logs for
interactions with the ad decision server (ADS).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnabledLoggingStrategies => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The method used for collecting logs from AWS Elemental MediaTailor.
C<LEGACY_CLOUDWATCH> indicates that MediaTailor is sending logs
directly to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. C<VENDED_LOGS> indicates that
MediaTailor is sending logs to CloudWatch, which then vends the logs to
your destination of choice. Supported destinations are CloudWatch Logs
log group, Amazon S3 bucket, and Amazon Data Firehose stream.


=head2 ManifestServiceInteractionLog => L<Paws::MediaTailor::ManifestServiceInteractionLog>

Settings for customizing what events are included in logs for
interactions with the origin server.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PercentEnabled => Int

The percentage of session logs that MediaTailor sends to your
configured log destination. For example, if your playback configuration
has 1000 sessions and C<percentEnabled> is set to C<60>, MediaTailor
sends logs for 600 of the sessions to CloudWatch Logs. MediaTailor
decides at random which of the playback configuration sessions to send
logs for. If you want to view logs for a specific session, you can use
the debug log mode
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/debug-log-mode.html).

Valid values: C<0> - C<100>
