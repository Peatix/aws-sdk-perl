=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::AccessConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::AccessConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessType => $value, ..., SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::AccessConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Access configuration parameters.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessType => Str

The type of authentication used to access content from
C<HttpConfiguration::BaseUrl> on your source location.

C<S3_SIGV4> - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon S3
hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is an
Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4)
authentication to access the bucket where your source content is
stored. Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must follow the S3
virtual hosted-style request URL format. For example,
https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

Before you can use C<S3_SIGV4>, you must meet these requirements:

E<bull> You must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by granting
mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For information
about configuring access in IAM, see Access management in the IAM User
Guide.

E<bull> The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have
permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by the VodSource
packaging configurations.

E<bull> The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject IAM permissions to
read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor VodSource
packaging configurations.

C<AUTODETECT_SIGV4> - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for a set
of supported services: MediaPackage Version 2 and Amazon S3 hosted
virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is a
MediaPackage Version 2 endpoint or an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can
use AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) authentication to access the
resource where your source content is stored.

Before you can use C<AUTODETECT_SIGV4> with a MediaPackage Version 2
endpoint, you must meet these requirements:

E<bull> You must grant MediaTailor access to your MediaPackage endpoint
by granting C<mediatailor.amazonaws.com> principal access in an Origin
Access policy on the endpoint.

E<bull> Your MediaTailor source location base URL must be a
MediaPackage V2 endpoint.

E<bull> The caller of the API must have C<mediapackagev2:GetObject> IAM
permissions to read all top level manifests referenced by the
MediaTailor source packaging configurations.

Before you can use C<AUTODETECT_SIGV4> with an Amazon S3 bucket, you
must meet these requirements:

E<bull> You must grant MediaTailor access to your S3 bucket by granting
C<mediatailor.amazonaws.com> principal access in IAM. For more
information about configuring access in IAM, see Access management
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access.html) in the
I<IAM User Guide.>.

E<bull> The C<mediatailor.amazonaws.com> service principal must have
permissions to read all top-level manifests referenced by the
C<VodSource> packaging configurations.

E<bull> The caller of the API must have C<s3:GetObject> IAM permissions
to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
C<VodSource> packaging configurations.
