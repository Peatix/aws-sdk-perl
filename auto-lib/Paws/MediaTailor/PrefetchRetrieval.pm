=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchRetrieval

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchRetrieval object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DynamicVariables => $value, ..., TrafficShapingType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::PrefetchRetrieval object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DynamicVariables

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that contains settings governing when MediaTailor
prefetches ads, and which dynamic variables that MediaTailor includes
in the request to the ad decision server.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DynamicVariables => L<Paws::MediaTailor::__mapOf__string>

The dynamic variables to use for substitution during prefetch requests
to the ad decision server (ADS).

You initially configure dynamic variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/variables.html) for
the ADS URL when you set up your playback configuration. When you
specify C<DynamicVariables> for prefetch retrieval, MediaTailor
includes the dynamic variables in the request to the ADS.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndTime => Str

The time when prefetch retrieval ends for the ad break. Prefetching
will be attempted for manifest requests that occur at or before this
time.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The time when prefetch retrievals can start for this break. Ad
prefetching will be attempted for manifest requests that occur at or
after this time. Defaults to the current time. If not specified, the
prefetch retrieval starts as soon as possible.


=head2 TrafficShapingRetrievalWindow => L<Paws::MediaTailor::TrafficShapingRetrievalWindow>

Configuration for spreading ADS traffic across a set window instead of
sending ADS requests for all sessions at the same time.


=head2 TrafficShapingType => Str

Indicates if this configuration uses a retrieval window for traffic
shaping and limiting the number of requests to the ADS at one time.
