=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::Transition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::Transition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DurationMillis => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::Transition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DurationMillis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Program transition configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DurationMillis => Int

The duration of the live program in seconds.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RelativePosition => Str

The position where this program will be inserted relative to the
C<RelativePosition>.


=head2 RelativeProgram => Str

The name of the program that this program will be inserted next to, as
defined by C<RelativePosition>.


=head2 ScheduledStartTimeMillis => Int

The date and time that the program is scheduled to start, in epoch
milliseconds.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

Defines when the program plays in the schedule. You can set the value
to C<ABSOLUTE> or C<RELATIVE>.

C<ABSOLUTE> - The program plays at a specific wall clock time. This
setting can only be used for channels using the C<LINEAR>
C<PlaybackMode>.

Note the following considerations when using C<ABSOLUTE> transitions:

If the preceding program in the schedule has a duration that extends
past the wall clock time, MediaTailor truncates the preceding program
on a common segment boundary.

If there are gaps in playback, MediaTailor plays the C<FillerSlate> you
configured for your linear channel.

C<RELATIVE> - The program is inserted into the schedule either before
or after a program that you specify via C<RelativePosition>.
