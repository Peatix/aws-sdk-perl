=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaTailor::ClipRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaTailor::ClipRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndOffsetMillis => $value, ..., StartOffsetMillis => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaTailor::ClipRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndOffsetMillis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clip range configuration for the VOD source associated with the
program.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndOffsetMillis => Int

The end offset of the clip range, in milliseconds, starting from the
beginning of the VOD source associated with the program.


=head2 StartOffsetMillis => Int

The start offset of the clip range, in milliseconds. This offset
truncates the start at the number of milliseconds into the duration of
the VOD source.
