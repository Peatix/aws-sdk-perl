=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::SourceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::SourceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthenticationConfiguration => $value, ..., ImageRepository => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::SourceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthenticationConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the source deployed to an App Runner service. It can be a
code or an image repository.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthenticationConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::AuthenticationConfiguration>

Describes the resources that are needed to authenticate access to some
source repositories.


=head2 AutoDeploymentsEnabled => Bool

If C<true>, continuous integration from the source repository is
enabled for the App Runner service. Each repository change (including
any source code commit or new image version) starts a deployment.

Default: App Runner sets to C<false> for a source image that uses an
ECR Public repository or an ECR repository that's in an Amazon Web
Services account other than the one that the service is in. App Runner
sets to C<true> in all other cases (which currently include a source
code repository or a source image using a same-account ECR repository).


=head2 CodeRepository => L<Paws::AppRunner::CodeRepository>

The description of a source code repository.

You must provide either this member or C<ImageRepository> (but not
both).


=head2 ImageRepository => L<Paws::AppRunner::ImageRepository>

The description of a source image repository.

You must provide either this member or C<CodeRepository> (but not
both).



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::AppRunner>
