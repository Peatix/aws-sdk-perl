=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::Service

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::Service object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingConfigurationSummary => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::Service object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingConfigurationSummary

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an App Runner service. It can describe a service in any
state, including deleted services.

This type contains the full information about a service, including
configuration details. It's returned by the CreateService
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_CreateService.html),
DescribeService
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_DescribeService.html),
and DeleteService
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_DeleteService.html)
actions. A subset of this information is returned by the ListServices
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_ListServices.html)
action using the ServiceSummary
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/api/API_ServiceSummary.html)
type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The runtime configuration of instances (scaling units) of this service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NetworkConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::NetworkConfiguration>

Configuration settings related to network traffic of the web
application that this service runs.


=head2 ObservabilityConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::ServiceObservabilityConfiguration>

The observability configuration of this service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceId => Str

successfully recovered. Retry the service deletion call to ensure that
all related resources are removed.

=back
