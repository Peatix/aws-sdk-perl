=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::VpcConnector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::VpcConnector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., VpcConnectorRevision => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::VpcConnector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an App Runner VPC connector resource. A VPC connector
describes the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) that an App
Runner service is associated with, and the subnets and security group
that are used.

Multiple revisions of a connector might have the same C<Name> and
different C<Revision> values.

At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time when the VPC connector was created. It's in Unix time stamp
format.


=head2 DeletedAt => Str

The time when the VPC connector was deleted. It's in Unix time stamp
format.


=head2 SecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner uses for access to
Amazon Web Services resources under the specified subnets. If not
specified, App Runner uses the default security group of the Amazon
VPC. The default security group allows all outbound traffic.


=head2 Status => Str

The current state of the VPC connector. If the status of a connector
revision is C<INACTIVE>, it was deleted and can't be used. Inactive
connector revisions are permanently removed some time after they are
deleted.


=head2 Subnets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of IDs of subnets that App Runner uses for your service. All IDs
are of subnets of a single Amazon VPC.


=head2 VpcConnectorArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this VPC connector.


=head2 VpcConnectorName => Str

The customer-provided VPC connector name.


=head2 VpcConnectorRevision => Int

The revision of this VPC connector. It's unique among all the active
connectors (C<"Status": "ACTIVE">) that share the same C<Name>.

At this time, App Runner supports only one revision per name.
