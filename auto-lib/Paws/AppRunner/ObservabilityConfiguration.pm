=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::ObservabilityConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::ObservabilityConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., TraceConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::ObservabilityConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an App Runner observability configuration resource. Multiple
revisions of a configuration have the same
C<ObservabilityConfigurationName> and different
C<ObservabilityConfigurationRevision> values.

The resource is designed to configure multiple features (currently one
feature, tracing). This type contains optional members that describe
the configuration of these features (currently one member,
C<TraceConfiguration>). If a feature member isn't specified, the
feature isn't enabled.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time when the observability configuration was created. It's in Unix
time stamp format.


=head2 DeletedAt => Str

The time when the observability configuration was deleted. It's in Unix
time stamp format.


=head2 Latest => Bool

It's set to C<true> for the configuration with the highest C<Revision>
among all configurations that share the same
C<ObservabilityConfigurationName>. It's set to C<false> otherwise.


=head2 ObservabilityConfigurationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this observability configuration.


=head2 ObservabilityConfigurationName => Str

The customer-provided observability configuration name. It can be used
in multiple revisions of a configuration.


=head2 ObservabilityConfigurationRevision => Int

The revision of this observability configuration. It's unique among all
the active configurations (C<"Status": "ACTIVE">) that share the same
C<ObservabilityConfigurationName>.


=head2 Status => Str

The current state of the observability configuration. If the status of
a configuration revision is C<INACTIVE>, it was deleted and can't be
used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently removed some
time after they are deleted.


=head2 TraceConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::TraceConfiguration>

The configuration of the tracing feature within this observability
configuration. If not specified, tracing isn't enabled.
