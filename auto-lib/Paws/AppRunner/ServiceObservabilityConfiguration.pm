=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::ServiceObservabilityConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::ServiceObservabilityConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ObservabilityConfigurationArn => $value, ..., ObservabilityEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::ServiceObservabilityConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ObservabilityConfigurationArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the observability configuration of an App Runner service.
These are additional observability features, like tracing, that you
choose to enable. They're configured in a separate resource that you
associate with your service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ObservabilityConfigurationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the observability configuration that
is associated with the service. Specified only when
C<ObservabilityEnabled> is C<true>.

Specify an ARN with a name and a revision number to associate that
revision. For example:
C<arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing/3>

Specify just the name to associate the latest revision. For example:
C<arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:observabilityconfiguration/xray-tracing>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ObservabilityEnabled => Bool

When C<true>, an observability configuration resource is associated
with the service, and an C<ObservabilityConfigurationArn> is specified.
