=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateCustomDomain on the
L<AWS App Runner|Paws::AppRunner> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateCustomDomain.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateCustomDomain.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $apprunner = Paws->service('AppRunner');
    my $DisassociateCustomDomainResponse = $apprunner->DisassociateCustomDomain(
      DomainName => 'MyDomainName',
      ServiceArn => 'MyAppRunnerResourceArn',

    );

    # Results:
    my $CustomDomain  = $DisassociateCustomDomainResponse->CustomDomain;
    my $DNSTarget     = $DisassociateCustomDomainResponse->DNSTarget;
    my $ServiceArn    = $DisassociateCustomDomainResponse->ServiceArn;
    my $VpcDNSTargets = $DisassociateCustomDomainResponse->VpcDNSTargets;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppRunner::DisassociateCustomDomainResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
