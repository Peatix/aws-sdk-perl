=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::AssociateCustomDomain - Arguments for method AssociateCustomDomain on L<Paws::AppRunner>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AssociateCustomDomain on the
L<AWS App Runner|Paws::AppRunner> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AssociateCustomDomain.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AssociateCustomDomain.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $apprunner = Paws->service('AppRunner');
    my $AssociateCustomDomainResponse = $apprunner->AssociateCustomDomain(
      DomainName         => 'MyDomainName',
      ServiceArn         => 'MyAppRunnerResourceArn',
      EnableWWWSubdomain => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CustomDomain  = $AssociateCustomDomainResponse->CustomDomain;
    my $DNSTarget     = $AssociateCustomDomainResponse->DNSTarget;
    my $ServiceArn    = $AssociateCustomDomainResponse->ServiceArn;
    my $VpcDNSTargets = $AssociateCustomDomainResponse->VpcDNSTargets;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppRunner::AssociateCustomDomainResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
