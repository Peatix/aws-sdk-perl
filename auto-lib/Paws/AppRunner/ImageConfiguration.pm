=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::ImageConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::ImageConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Port => $value, ..., StartCommand => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::ImageConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Port

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration that App Runner uses to run an App Runner
service using an image pulled from a source image repository.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Port => Str

The port that your application listens to in the container.

Default: C<8080>


=head2 RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets => L<Paws::AppRunner::RuntimeEnvironmentSecrets>

An array of key-value pairs representing the secrets and parameters
that get referenced to your service as an environment variable. The
supported values are either the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.

If the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter
exists in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the service that
you're launching, you can use either the full ARN or name of the
secret. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full
ARN must be specified.

Currently, cross account referencing of Amazon Web Services Systems
Manager Parameter Store parameter is not supported.

=head2 RuntimeEnvironmentVariables => L<Paws::AppRunner::RuntimeEnvironmentVariables>

Environment variables that are available to your running App Runner
service. An array of key-value pairs.


=head2 StartCommand => Str
