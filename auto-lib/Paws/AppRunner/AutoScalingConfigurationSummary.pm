=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::AutoScalingConfigurationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::AutoScalingConfigurationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingConfigurationArn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::AutoScalingConfigurationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingConfigurationArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides summary information about an App Runner automatic scaling
configuration resource.

This type contains limited information about an auto scaling
configuration. It includes only identification information, without
configuration details. It's returned by the
ListAutoScalingConfigurations action. Complete configuration
information is returned by the CreateAutoScalingConfiguration,
DescribeAutoScalingConfiguration, and DeleteAutoScalingConfiguration
actions using the AutoScalingConfiguration type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingConfigurationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this auto scaling configuration.


=head2 AutoScalingConfigurationName => Str

The customer-provided auto scaling configuration name. It can be used
in multiple revisions of a configuration.


=head2 AutoScalingConfigurationRevision => Int

The revision of this auto scaling configuration. It's unique among all
the active configurations (C<"Status": "ACTIVE">) with the same
C<AutoScalingConfigurationName>.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time when the auto scaling configuration was created. It's in Unix
time stamp format.


=head2 HasAssociatedService => Bool

Indicates if this auto scaling configuration has an App Runner service
associated with it. A value of C<true> indicates one or more services
are associated. A value of C<false> indicates no services are
associated.


=head2 IsDefault => Bool

Indicates if this auto scaling configuration should be used as the
default for a new App Runner service that does not have an auto scaling
configuration ARN specified during creation. Each account can have only
one default C<AutoScalingConfiguration> per region. The default
C<AutoScalingConfiguration> can be any revision under the same
C<AutoScalingConfigurationName>.


=head2 Status => Str

The current state of the auto scaling configuration. If the status of a
configuration revision is C<INACTIVE>, it was deleted and can't be
used. Inactive configuration revisions are permanently removed some
time after they are deleted.
