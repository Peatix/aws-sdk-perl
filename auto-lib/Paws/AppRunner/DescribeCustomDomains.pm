=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::DescribeCustomDomains - Arguments for method DescribeCustomDomains on L<Paws::AppRunner>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeCustomDomains on the
L<AWS App Runner|Paws::AppRunner> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeCustomDomains.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeCustomDomains.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $apprunner = Paws->service('AppRunner');
    my $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse = $apprunner->DescribeCustomDomains(
      ServiceArn => 'MyAppRunnerResourceArn',
      MaxResults => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyString',                 # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CustomDomains = $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse->CustomDomains;
    my $DNSTarget     = $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse->DNSTarget;
    my $NextToken     = $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse->NextToken;
    my $ServiceArn    = $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse->ServiceArn;
    my $VpcDNSTargets = $DescribeCustomDomainsResponse->VpcDNSTargets;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppRunner::DescribeCustomDomainsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/apprunner/DescribeCustomDomains>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results that each response (result page) can
include. It's used for a paginated request.

If you don't specify C<MaxResults>, the request retrieves all available
results in a single response.



=head2 NextToken => Str

A token from a previous result page. It's used for a paginated request.
The request retrieves the next result page. All other parameter values
must be identical to the ones that are specified in the initial
request.

If you don't specify C<NextToken>, the request retrieves the first
result page.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the App Runner service that you want
associated custom domain names to be described for.
