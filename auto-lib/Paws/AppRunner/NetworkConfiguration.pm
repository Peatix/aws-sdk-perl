=head1 NAME

Paws::AppRunner::NetworkConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppRunner::NetworkConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EgressConfiguration => $value, ..., IpAddressType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppRunner::NetworkConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EgressConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes configuration settings related to network traffic of an App
Runner service. Consists of embedded objects for each configurable
network feature.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EgressConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::EgressConfiguration>

Network configuration settings for outbound message traffic.


=head2 IngressConfiguration => L<Paws::AppRunner::IngressConfiguration>

Network configuration settings for inbound message traffic.


=head2 IpAddressType => Str

App Runner provides you with the option to choose between I<Internet
Protocol version 4 (IPv4)> and I<dual stack> (IPv4 and IPv6) for your
incoming public network configuration. This is an optional parameter.
If you do not specify an C<IpAddressType>, it defaults to select IPv4.

Currently, App Runner supports dual stack for only Public endpoint.
Only IPv4 is supported for Private endpoint. If you update a service
that's using dual-stack Public endpoint to a Private endpoint, your App
Runner service will default to support only IPv4 for Private endpoint
and fail to receive traffic originating from IPv6 endpoint.
