Paws::AppRunner::CreateConnection - Arguments for method CreateConnection on L<Paws::AppRunner>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateConnection on the
L<AWS App Runner|Paws::AppRunner> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateConnection.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateConnection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $apprunner = Paws->service('AppRunner');
    my $CreateConnectionResponse = $apprunner->CreateConnection(
      ConnectionName => 'MyConnectionName',
      ProviderType   => 'GITHUB',
      Tags           => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128; OPTIONAL
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Connection = $CreateConnectionResponse->Connection;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppRunner::CreateConnectionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
