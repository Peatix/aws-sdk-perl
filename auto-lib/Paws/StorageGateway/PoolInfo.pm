=head1 NAME

Paws::StorageGateway::PoolInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::StorageGateway::PoolInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PoolARN => $value, ..., StorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::StorageGateway::PoolInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PoolARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a custom tape pool.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PoolARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom tape pool. Use the
ListTapePools operation to return a list of custom tape pools for your

The name of the custom tape pool. C<PoolName> can use all ASCII

enabled for up to 100 years (36,500 days).


=head2 RetentionLockType => Str

Tape retention lock type, which can be configured in two modes. When
configured in governance mode, Amazon Web Services accounts with
