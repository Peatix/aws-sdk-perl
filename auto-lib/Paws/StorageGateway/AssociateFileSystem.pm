=head1 NAME

Paws::StorageGateway::AssociateFileSystem - Arguments for method AssociateFileSystem on L<Paws::StorageGateway>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AssociateFileSystem on the
L<AWS Storage Gateway|Paws::StorageGateway> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AssociateFileSystem.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AssociateFileSystem.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $storagegateway = Paws->service('StorageGateway');
    my $AssociateFileSystemOutput = $storagegateway->AssociateFileSystem(
      ClientToken         => 'MyClientToken',
      GatewayARN          => 'MyGatewayARN',
      LocationARN         => 'MyFileSystemLocationARN',
      Password            => 'MyDomainUserPassword',
      UserName            => 'MyDomainUserName',
      AuditDestinationARN => 'MyAuditDestinationARN',     # OPTIONAL
      CacheAttributes     => {
        CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      EndpointNetworkConfiguration => {
        IpAddresses => [
          'MyIPV4Address', ...    # min: 7, max: 15
        ],    # max: 1; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $FileSystemAssociationARN =
      $AssociateFileSystemOutput->FileSystemAssociationARN;

    # Returns a L<Paws::StorageGateway::AssociateFileSystemOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
