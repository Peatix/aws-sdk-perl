=head1 NAME

Paws::StorageGateway::AssignTapePool - Arguments for method AssignTapePool on L<Paws::StorageGateway>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method AssignTapePool on the
L<AWS Storage Gateway|Paws::StorageGateway> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method AssignTapePool.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to AssignTapePool.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $storagegateway = Paws->service('StorageGateway');
    my $AssignTapePoolOutput = $storagegateway->AssignTapePool(
      PoolId                    => 'MyPoolId',
      TapeARN                   => 'MyTapeARN',
      BypassGovernanceRetention => 1,             # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $TapeARN = $AssignTapePoolOutput->TapeARN;

    # Returns a L<Paws::StorageGateway::AssignTapePoolOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/storagegateway/AssignTapePool>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BypassGovernanceRetention => Bool

Set permissions to bypass governance retention. If the lock type of the
archived tape is C<Governance>, the tape's archived age is not older
than C<RetentionLockInDays>, and the user does not already have
C<BypassGovernanceRetention>, setting this to TRUE enables the user to
bypass the retention lock. This parameter is set to true by default for
calls from the console.

Valid values: C<TRUE> | C<FALSE>



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PoolId => Str

The ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving. The
tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage class that is
associated with the pool. When you use your backup application to eject
the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class (S3
Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive) that corresponds to the pool.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TapeARN => Str

The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape that you want
to add to the tape pool.
