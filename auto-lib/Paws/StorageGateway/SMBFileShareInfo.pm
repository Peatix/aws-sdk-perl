=head1 NAME

Paws::StorageGateway::SMBFileShareInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::StorageGateway::SMBFileShareInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessBasedEnumeration => $value, ..., VPCEndpointDNSName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::StorageGateway::SMBFileShareInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessBasedEnumeration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Windows file permissions and ownership information assigned, by
default, to native S3 objects when S3 File Gateway discovers them in S3
buckets. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessBasedEnumeration => Bool

Indicates whether C<AccessBasedEnumeration> is enabled.


=head2 AdminUserList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that have
administrator rights to the file share. A group must be prefixed with
the @ character. Acceptable formats include: C<DOMAIN\User1>, C<user1>,
C<@group1>, and C<@DOMAIN\group1>. Can only be set if Authentication is
set to C<ActiveDirectory>.


=head2 AuditDestinationARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.


=head2 Authentication => Str




=head2 BucketRegion => Str

Specifies the Region of the S3 bucket where the SMB file share stores
files.

This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon
S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias
that points to a VPC access point.


=head2 CacheAttributes => L<Paws::StorageGateway::CacheAttributes>

Refresh cache information for the file share.


=head2 CaseSensitivity => Str

The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For
C<ClientSpecified>, the client determines the case sensitivity. For
C<CaseSensitive>, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The
default value is C<ClientSpecified>.


=head2 DefaultStorageClass => Str

The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by
the S3 File Gateway. The default value is C<S3_STANDARD>. Optional.

Valid Values: C<S3_STANDARD> | C<S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING> |
C<S3_STANDARD_IA> | C<S3_ONEZONE_IA>


=head2 EncryptionType => Str

A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file
share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.

We recommend using C<EncryptionType> instead of C<KMSEncrypted> to set
the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for
both parameters.

If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the
specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if
C<EncryptionType> is C<SseS3>, then C<KMSEncrypted> must be C<false>.
If C<EncryptionType> is C<SseKms> or C<DsseKms>, then C<KMSEncrypted>
must be C<true>.


=head2 FileShareARN => Str




=head2 FileShareId => Str




=head2 FileShareName => Str

The name of the file share. Optional.

C<FileShareName> must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in
C<LocationARN>, or if an access point or access point alias is used.


=head2 FileShareStatus => Str




=head2 GatewayARN => Str




=head2 GuessMIMETypeEnabled => Bool

A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects
based on file extensions. Set this value to C<true> to enable MIME type
guessing, otherwise set to C<false>. The default value is C<true>.

Valid Values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 InvalidUserList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed
to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @
character. Acceptable formats include: C<DOMAIN\User1>, C<user1>,
C<@group1>, and C<@DOMAIN\group1>. Can only be set if Authentication is
set to C<ActiveDirectory>.


=head2 KMSEncrypted => Bool

Optional. Set to C<true> to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with
your own KMS key (SSE-KMS), or C<false> to use a key managed by Amazon
S3 (SSE-S3). To use dual-layer encryption (DSSE-KMS), set the
C<EncryptionType> parameter instead.

We recommend using C<EncryptionType> instead of C<KMSEncrypted> to set
the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for
both parameters.

If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the
specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if
C<EncryptionType> is C<SseS3>, then C<KMSEncrypted> must be C<false>.
If C<EncryptionType> is C<SseKms> or C<DsseKms>, then C<KMSEncrypted>
must be C<true>.

Valid Values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 KMSKey => Str




=head2 LocationARN => Str




=head2 NotificationPolicy => Str

The notification policy of the file share. C<SettlingTimeInSeconds>
controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a
client wrote to a file before generating an C<ObjectUploaded>
notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's
best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating
multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

C<SettlingTimeInSeconds> has no effect on the timing of the object
uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the
notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require
more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.

The following example sets C<NotificationPolicy> on with
C<SettlingTimeInSeconds> set to 60.

C<{\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}>

The following example sets C<NotificationPolicy> off.

C<{}>


=head2 ObjectACL => Str




=head2 OplocksEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file
share.

Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not
recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same
name in different case.

Valid Values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 Path => Str

The file share path used by the SMB client to identify the mount point.


=head2 ReadOnly => Bool

A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to
C<true> to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to
C<false>.

Valid Values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 RequesterPays => Bool

A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost
associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set
to C<true>, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket
owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of
storing data.

C<RequesterPays> is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the
file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is
the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

Valid Values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 Role => Str




=head2 SMBACLEnabled => Bool

If this value is set to C<true>, it indicates that access control list
(ACL) is enabled on the SMB file share. If it is set to C<false>, it
indicates that file and directory permissions are mapped to the POSIX
permission.

For more information, see Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share
access
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/filegateway/latest/files3/smb-acl.html) in
the I<Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide>.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::StorageGateway::Tag>]

A list of up to 50 tags assigned to the SMB file share, sorted
alphabetically by key name. Each tag is a key-value pair. For a gateway
with more than 10 tags assigned, you can view all tags using the
C<ListTagsForResource> API operation.


=head2 ValidUserList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to
access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character.
Acceptable formats include: C<DOMAIN\User1>, C<user1>, C<@group1>, and
C<@DOMAIN\group1>. Can only be set if Authentication is set to
C<ActiveDirectory>.


=head2 VPCEndpointDNSName => Str

Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file share
uses to connect to Amazon S3.

This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon
S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias
that points to a VPC access point.
