=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::DisassociateTrackerConsumer - Arguments for method DisassociateTrackerConsumer on L<Paws::LocationService>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateTrackerConsumer on the
L<Amazon Location Service|Paws::LocationService> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateTrackerConsumer.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateTrackerConsumer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $geo = Paws->service('LocationService');
    my $DisassociateTrackerConsumerResponse = $geo->DisassociateTrackerConsumer(
      ConsumerArn => 'MyArn',
      TrackerName => 'MyResourceName',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
