=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::SearchForPositionResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::SearchForPositionResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Distance => $value, ..., PlaceId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::SearchForPositionResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Distance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a search result from a position search query that is run on a
place index resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Distance => Num

The distance in meters of a great-circle arc between the query position
and the result.

A great-circle arc is the shortest path on a sphere, in this case the
Earth. This returns the shortest distance between two locations.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Place => L<Paws::LocationService::Place>

Details about the search result, such as its address and position.


=head2 PlaceId => Str

The unique identifier of the place. You can use this with the
C<GetPlace> operation to find the place again later.

For C<SearchPlaceIndexForPosition> operations, the C<PlaceId> is
returned only by place indexes that use HERE or Grab as a data
provider.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::LocationService>
