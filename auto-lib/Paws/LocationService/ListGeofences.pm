=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::ListGeofences - Arguments for method ListGeofences on L<Paws::LocationService>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListGeofences on the
L<Amazon Location Service|Paws::LocationService> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListGeofences.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListGeofences.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $geo = Paws->service('LocationService');
    my $ListGeofencesResponse = $geo->ListGeofences(
      CollectionName => 'MyResourceName',
      MaxResults     => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      NextToken      => 'MyLargeToken',     # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Entries   = $ListGeofencesResponse->Entries;
    my $NextToken = $ListGeofencesResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LocationService::ListGeofencesResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/geo/ListGeofences>
