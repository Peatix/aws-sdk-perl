=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::GeofenceGeometry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::GeofenceGeometry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Circle => $value, ..., Polygon => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::GeofenceGeometry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Circle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the geofence geometry details.

A geofence geometry is made up of either a polygon or a circle. Can be
a polygon, a circle or a polygon encoded in Geobuf format. Including
multiple selections will return a validation error.

Amazon Location doesn't currently support polygons with holes,
multipolygons, polygons that are wound clockwise, or that cross the
antimeridian.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Circle => L<Paws::LocationService::Circle>

A circle on the earth, as defined by a center point and a radius.


=head2 Geobuf => Str

Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for geographic data that provides
lossless compression of GeoJSON polygons. The Geobuf must be
Base64-encoded.

A polygon in Geobuf format can have up to 100,000 vertices.


=head2 Polygon => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Num]]]

A polygon is a list of linear rings which are each made up of a list of
vertices.

Each vertex is a 2-dimensional point of the form: C<[longitude,
latitude]>. This is represented as an array of doubles of length 2 (so
C<[double, double]>).

An array of 4 or more vertices, where the first and last vertex are the
same (to form a closed boundary), is called a linear ring. The linear
ring vertices must be listed in counter-clockwise order around the
ringE<rsquo>s interior. The linear ring is represented as an array of
vertices, or an array of arrays of doubles (C<[[double, double],
...]>).

A geofence consists of a single linear ring. To allow for future
expansion, the Polygon parameter takes an array of linear rings, which
is represented as an array of arrays of arrays of doubles (C<[[[double,
double], ...], ...]>).

A linear ring for use in geofences can consist of between 4 and 1,000
vertices.
