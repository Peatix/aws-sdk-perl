=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::GetDevicePosition - Arguments for method GetDevicePosition on L<Paws::LocationService>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetDevicePosition on the
L<Amazon Location Service|Paws::LocationService> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetDevicePosition.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetDevicePosition.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $geo = Paws->service('LocationService');
    my $GetDevicePositionResponse = $geo->GetDevicePosition(
      DeviceId    => 'MyId',
      TrackerName => 'MyResourceName',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Accuracy           = $GetDevicePositionResponse->Accuracy;
    my $DeviceId           = $GetDevicePositionResponse->DeviceId;
    my $Position           = $GetDevicePositionResponse->Position;
    my $PositionProperties = $GetDevicePositionResponse->PositionProperties;
    my $ReceivedTime       = $GetDevicePositionResponse->ReceivedTime;
    my $SampleTime         = $GetDevicePositionResponse->SampleTime;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LocationService::GetDevicePositionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/geo/GetDevicePosition>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeviceId => Str
