=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::DevicePositionUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::DevicePositionUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Accuracy => $value, ..., SampleTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::DevicePositionUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Accuracy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the position update details for a device.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accuracy => L<Paws::LocationService::PositionalAccuracy>

The accuracy of the device position.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeviceId => Str

The device associated to the position update.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Position => ArrayRef[Num]

The latest device position defined in WGS 84
(https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&action=wgs84) format:
C<[X or longitude, Y or latitude]>.


=head2 PositionProperties => L<Paws::LocationService::PositionPropertyMap>

Associates one of more properties with the position update. A property
is a key-value pair stored with the position update and added to any
geofence event the update may trigger.

Format: C<"key" : "value">


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SampleTime => Str

The timestamp at which the device's position was determined. Uses ISO
8601 (https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format:
C<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ>
