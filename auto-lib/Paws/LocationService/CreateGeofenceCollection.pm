Paws::LocationService::CreateGeofenceCollection - Arguments for method CreateGeofenceCollection on L<Paws::LocationService>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateGeofenceCollection on the
L<Amazon Location Service|Paws::LocationService> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateGeofenceCollection.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateGeofenceCollection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $geo = Paws->service('LocationService');
    my $CreateGeofenceCollectionResponse = $geo->CreateGeofenceCollection(
      CollectionName        => 'MyResourceName',
      Description           => 'MyResourceDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      KmsKeyId              => 'MyKmsKeyId',               # OPTIONAL
      PricingPlan           => 'RequestBasedUsage',        # OPTIONAL
      PricingPlanDataSource => 'MyString',                 # OPTIONAL
      Tags                  => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CollectionArn  = $CreateGeofenceCollectionResponse->CollectionArn;
    my $CollectionName = $CreateGeofenceCollectionResponse->CollectionName;
    my $CreateTime     = $CreateGeofenceCollectionResponse->CreateTime;

  # Returns a L<Paws::LocationService::CreateGeofenceCollectionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
