=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::CalculateRouteSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::CalculateRouteSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataSource => $value, ..., RouteBBox => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::CalculateRouteSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataSource

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of the calculated route.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataSource => Str

The data provider of traffic and road network data used to calculate
the route. Indicates one of the available providers:

=over

=item *

C<Esri>

=item *

C<Grab>

=item *

C<Here>

=back

For more information about data providers, see Amazon Location Service
data providers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/what-is-data-provider.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Distance => Num

The total distance covered by the route. The sum of the distance
travelled between every stop on the route.

If Esri is the data source for the route calculator, the route distance
canE<rsquo>t be greater than 400 km. If the route exceeds 400 km, the
response is a C<400 RoutesValidationException> error.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DistanceUnit => Str

The unit of measurement for route distances.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DurationSeconds => Num

The total travel time for the route measured in seconds. The sum of the
travel time between every stop on the route.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RouteBBox => ArrayRef[Num]

Specifies a geographical box surrounding a route. Used to zoom into a
route when displaying it in a map. For example, C<[min x, min y, max x,
max y]>.

The first 2 C<bbox> parameters describe the lower southwest corner:

=over

=item *

The first C<bbox> position is the X coordinate or longitude of the
lower southwest corner.

=item *

The second C<bbox> position is the Y coordinate or latitude of the
lower southwest corner.

=back

The next 2 C<bbox> parameters describe the upper northeast corner:

=over

=item *

The third C<bbox> position is the X coordinate, or longitude of the
upper northeast corner.

=item *

The fourth C<bbox> position is the Y coordinate, or latitude of the
upper northeast corner.
