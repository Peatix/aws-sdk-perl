Paws::LocationService::CalculateRouteResponse

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Legs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LocationService::Leg>]

Contains details about each path between a pair of positions included
along a route such as: C<StartPosition>, C<EndPosition>, C<Distance>,
C<DurationSeconds>, C<Geometry>, and C<Steps>. The number of legs
returned corresponds to one fewer than the total number of positions in
the request.

For example, a route with a departure position and destination position
returns one leg with the positions snapped to a nearby road
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/snap-to-nearby-road.html):

=over

=item *

The C<StartPosition> is the departure position.

=item *

The C<EndPosition> is the destination position.

=back

A route with a waypoint between the departure and destination position
returns two legs with the positions snapped to a nearby road:

=over

=item *

Leg 1: The C<StartPosition> is the departure position . The
C<EndPosition> is the waypoint positon.

=item *

Leg 2: The C<StartPosition> is the waypoint position. The
C<EndPosition> is the destination position.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Summary => L<Paws::LocationService::CalculateRouteSummary>

Contains information about the whole route, such as: C<RouteBBox>,
C<DataSource>, C<Distance>, C<DistanceUnit>, and C<DurationSeconds>.
