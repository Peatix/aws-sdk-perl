Paws::LocationService::GetGeofence - Arguments for method GetGeofence on L<Paws::LocationService>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetGeofence on the
L<Amazon Location Service|Paws::LocationService> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetGeofence.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetGeofence.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $geo = Paws->service('LocationService');
    my $GetGeofenceResponse = $geo->GetGeofence(
      CollectionName => 'MyResourceName',
      GeofenceId     => 'MyId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $CreateTime         = $GetGeofenceResponse->CreateTime;
    my $GeofenceId         = $GetGeofenceResponse->GeofenceId;
    my $GeofenceProperties = $GetGeofenceResponse->GeofenceProperties;
    my $Geometry           = $GetGeofenceResponse->Geometry;
    my $Status             = $GetGeofenceResponse->Status;
    my $UpdateTime         = $GetGeofenceResponse->UpdateTime;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LocationService::GetGeofenceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
