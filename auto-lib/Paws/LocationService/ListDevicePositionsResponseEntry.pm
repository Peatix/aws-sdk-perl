=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::ListDevicePositionsResponseEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::ListDevicePositionsResponseEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Accuracy => $value, ..., SampleTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::ListDevicePositionsResponseEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Accuracy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the tracker resource details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accuracy => L<Paws::LocationService::PositionalAccuracy>

The accuracy of the device position.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeviceId => Str

The ID of the device for this position.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Position => ArrayRef[Num]

The last known device position. Empty if no positions currently stored.


=head2 PositionProperties => L<Paws::LocationService::PositionPropertyMap>

The properties associated with the position.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SampleTime => Str

The timestamp at which the device position was determined. Uses ISO
8601 (https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format:
C<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ>.
