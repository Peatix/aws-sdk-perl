=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::ForecastedEvent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::ForecastedEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EventId => $value, ..., NearestDistance => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::ForecastedEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EventId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A forecasted event represents a geofence event in relation to the
requested device state, that may occur given the provided device state
and time horizon.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventId => Str

The forecasted event identifier.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventType => Str

The event type, forecasting three states for which a device can be in
relative to a geofence:

C<ENTER>: If a device is outside of a geofence, but would breach the
fence if the device is moving at its current speed within time horizon
window.

C<EXIT>: If a device is inside of a geofence, but would breach the
fence if the device is moving at its current speed within time horizon
window.

C<IDLE>: If a device is inside of a geofence, and the device is not
moving.


=head2 ForecastedBreachTime => Str

The forecasted time the device will breach the geofence in ISO 8601
(https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format:
C<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GeofenceId => Str

The geofence identifier pertaining to the forecasted event.


=head2 GeofenceProperties => L<Paws::LocationService::PropertyMap>

The geofence properties.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IsDeviceInGeofence => Bool

Indicates if the device is located within the geofence.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NearestDistance => Num

The closest distance from the device's position to the geofence.
