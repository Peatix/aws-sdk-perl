=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::ApiKeyRestrictions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::ApiKeyRestrictions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowActions => $value, ..., AllowResources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::ApiKeyRestrictions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowActions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

API Restrictions on the allowed actions, resources, and referers for an
API key resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of allowed actions that an API key resource grants permissions
to perform. You must have at least one action for each type of
resource. For example, if you have a place resource, you must include
at least one place action.

The following are valid values for the actions.

=over

=item *

B<Map actions>

=over

=item *

C<geo:GetMap*> - Allows all actions needed for map rendering.

=back

=item *

B<Place actions>

=over

=item *

C<geo:SearchPlaceIndexForText> - Allows geocoding.

=item *

C<geo:SearchPlaceIndexForPosition> - Allows reverse geocoding.

=item *

C<geo:SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions> - Allows generating suggestions
from text.

=item *

C<GetPlace> - Allows finding a place by place ID.

=back

=item *

B<Route actions>

=over

=item *

C<geo:CalculateRoute> - Allows point to point routing.

=item *

C<geo:CalculateRouteMatrix> - Allows calculating a matrix of routes.

=back

=back

You must use these strings exactly. For example, to provide access to
map rendering, the only valid action is C<geo:GetMap*> as an input to
the list. C<["geo:GetMap*"]> is valid but C<["geo:GetMapTile"]> is not.
Similarly, you cannot use C<["geo:SearchPlaceIndexFor*"]> - you must
list each of the Place actions separately.


=head2 AllowReferers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An optional list of allowed HTTP referers for which requests must
originate from. Requests using this API key from other domains will not
be allowed.

Requirements:

=over

=item *

Contain only alphanumeric characters (AE<ndash>Z, aE<ndash>z,
0E<ndash>9) or any symbols in this list C<$\-._+!*`(),;/?:@=&>

=item *

May contain a percent (%) if followed by 2 hexadecimal digits (A-F,
a-f, 0-9); this is used for URL encoding purposes.

=item *

May contain wildcard characters question mark (?) and asterisk (*).

Question mark (?) will replace any single character (including
hexadecimal digits).

Asterisk (*) will replace any multiple characters (including multiple
hexadecimal digits).

=item *

No spaces allowed. For example, C<https://example.com>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowResources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of allowed resource ARNs that a API key bearer can perform
actions on.

=over

=item *

The ARN must be the correct ARN for a map, place, or route ARN. You may
include wildcards in the resource-id to match multiple resources of the
same type.

=item *

The resources must be in the same C<partition>, C<region>, and
C<account-id> as the key that is being created.

=item *

Other than wildcards, you must include the full ARN, including the
C<arn>, C<partition>, C<service>, C<region>, C<account-id> and
C<resource-id> delimited by colons (:).

=item *

No spaces allowed, even with wildcards. For example,
C<arn:aws:geo:region:I<account-id>:map/ExampleMap*>.

=back

For more information about ARN format, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
