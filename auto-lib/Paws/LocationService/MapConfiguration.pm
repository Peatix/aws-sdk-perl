=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::MapConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::MapConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomLayers => $value, ..., Style => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::MapConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomLayers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the map tile style selected from an available provider.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomLayers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the custom layers for the style. Leave unset to not enable
any custom layer, or, for styles that support custom layers, you can
enable layer(s), such as POI layer for the VectorEsriNavigation style.
Default is C<unset>.

Not all map resources or styles support custom layers. See Custom
Layers for more information.


=head2 PoliticalView => Str

Specifies the political view for the style. Leave unset to not use a
political view, or, for styles that support specific political views,
you can choose a view, such as C<IND> for the Indian view.

Default is unset.

Not all map resources or styles support political view styles. See
Political views
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/map-concepts.html#political-views)
for more information.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Style => Str

Specifies the map style selected from an available data provider.

style. A vector basemap with a dark gray, neutral background with
minimal colors, labels, and features that's designed to draw attention
to your thematic content.

=item *

C<RasterEsriImagery> E<ndash> The Esri Imagery map style. A raster
basemap that provides one meter or better satellite and aerial imagery
in many parts of the world and lower resolution satellite imagery
worldwide.

=item *

C<VectorEsriLightGrayCanvas> E<ndash> The Esri Light Gray Canvas map
style, which provides a detailed vector basemap with a light gray,
neutral background style with minimal colors, labels, and features
that's designed to draw attention to your thematic content.

=item *

C<VectorEsriTopographic> E<ndash> The Esri Light map style, which
provides a detailed vector basemap with a classic Esri map style.

=item *

C<VectorEsriStreets> E<ndash> The Esri Street Map style, which provides
a detailed vector basemap for the world symbolized with a classic Esri
street map style. The vector tile layer is similar in content and style
to the World Street Map raster map.

=item *

C<VectorEsriNavigation> E<ndash> The Esri Navigation map style, which
provides a detailed basemap for the world symbolized with a custom
navigation map style that's designed for use during the day in mobile
devices.

Valid HERE Technologies map styles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/HERE.html):

=over

=item *

C<VectorHereContrast> E<ndash> The HERE Contrast (Berlin) map style is
a high contrast detailed base map of the world that blends 3D and 2D
rendering.

The C<VectorHereContrast> style has been renamed from
C<VectorHereBerlin>. C<VectorHereBerlin> has been deprecated, but will
continue to work in applications that use it.

=item *

C<VectorHereExplore> E<ndash> A default HERE map style containing a
neutral, global map and its features including roads, buildings,
landmarks, and water features. It also now includes a fully designed
map of Japan.

=item *

C<VectorHereExploreTruck> E<ndash> A global map containing truck
restrictions and attributes (e.g. width / height / HAZMAT) symbolized
with highlighted segments and icons on top of HERE Explore to support
use cases within transport and logistics.

=item *

C<RasterHereExploreSatellite> E<ndash> A global map containing high
resolution satellite imagery.

=item *

C<HybridHereExploreSatellite> E<ndash> A global map displaying the road
network, street names, and city labels over satellite imagery. This
style will automatically retrieve both raster and vector tiles, and
your charges will be based on total tiles retrieved.

Hybrid styles use both vector and raster tiles when rendering the map
that you see. This means that more tiles are retrieved than when using
either vector or raster tiles alone. Your charges will include all
tiles retrieved.
