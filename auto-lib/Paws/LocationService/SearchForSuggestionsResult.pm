Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Categories => $value, ..., Text => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::SearchForSuggestionsResult object:

  $result->Att1->Categories

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a place suggestion resulting from a place suggestion query
that is run on a place index resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Categories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Location categories that describe the Place.

For more information about using categories, including a list of Amazon
Location categories, see Categories and filtering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/category-filtering.html),
in the I<Amazon Location Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 PlaceId => Str

The unique identifier of the Place. You can use this with the
C<GetPlace> operation to find the place again later, or to get full
information for the Place.

The C<GetPlace> request must use the same C<PlaceIndex> resource as the
C<SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions> that generated the Place ID.

For C<SearchPlaceIndexForSuggestions> operations, the C<PlaceId> is
returned by place indexes that use Esri, Grab, or HERE as data
providers.


=head2 SupplementalCategories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Categories from the data provider that describe the Place that are not
mapped to any Amazon Location categories.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Text => Str

The text of the place suggestion, typically formatted as an address
string.
