=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::BatchPutGeofenceRequestEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::BatchPutGeofenceRequestEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GeofenceId => $value, ..., Geometry => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::BatchPutGeofenceRequestEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GeofenceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains geofence geometry details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GeofenceId => Str

The identifier for the geofence to be stored in a given geofence
collection.


=head2 GeofenceProperties => L<Paws::LocationService::PropertyMap>

Associates one of more properties with the geofence. A property is a
key-value pair stored with the geofence and added to any geofence event
triggered with that geofence.

Format: C<"key" : "value">


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Geometry => L<Paws::LocationService::GeofenceGeometry>

Contains the details to specify the position of the geofence. Can be a
polygon, a circle or a polygon encoded in Geobuf format. Including
multiple selections will return a validation error.

The geofence polygon
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location-geofences/latest/APIReference/API_GeofenceGeometry.html)
format supports a maximum of 1,000 vertices. The Geofence geobuf
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location-geofences/latest/APIReference/API_GeofenceGeometry.html)
format supports a maximum of 100,000 vertices.
