=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::ListGeofenceResponseEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::ListGeofenceResponseEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreateTime => $value, ..., UpdateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::ListGeofenceResponseEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a list of geofences stored in a given geofence collection.

The returned geometry will always match the geometry format used when
the geofence was created.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreateTime => Str

The timestamp for when the geofence was stored in a geofence collection
in ISO 8601 (https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)
format: C<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GeofenceId => Str

The geofence identifier.


=head2 GeofenceProperties => L<Paws::LocationService::PropertyMap>

User defined properties of the geofence. A property is a key-value pair
stored with the geofence and added to any geofence event triggered with
that geofence.

Format: C<"key" : "value">


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Geometry => L<Paws::LocationService::GeofenceGeometry>

Contains the geofence geometry details describing a polygon or a
circle.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Identifies the state of the geofence. A geofence will hold one of the
following states:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE> E<mdash> The geofence has been indexed by the system.

=item *

C<PENDING> E<mdash> The geofence is being processed by the system.

=item *

C<FAILED> E<mdash> The geofence failed to be indexed by the system.

=item *

C<DELETED> E<mdash> The geofence has been deleted from the system
index.

=item *

C<DELETING> E<mdash> The geofence is being deleted from the system
index.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdateTime => Str

The timestamp for when the geofence was last updated in ISO 8601
(https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format:
C<YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssZ>
