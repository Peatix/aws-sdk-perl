=head1 NAME

Paws::LocationService::SearchForTextResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LocationService::SearchForTextResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Distance => $value, ..., Relevance => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LocationService::SearchForTextResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Distance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a search result from a text search query that is run on a
place index resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Distance => Num

The distance in meters of a great-circle arc between the bias position
specified and the result. C<Distance> will be returned only if a bias
position was specified in the query.

A great-circle arc is the shortest path on a sphere, in this case the
Earth. This returns the shortest distance between two locations.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Place => L<Paws::LocationService::Place>

Details about the search result, such as its address and position.


=head2 PlaceId => Str

The unique identifier of the place. You can use this with the
C<GetPlace> operation to find the place again later.

For C<SearchPlaceIndexForText> operations, the C<PlaceId> is returned
only by place indexes that use HERE or Grab as a data provider.


=head2 Relevance => Num

The relative confidence in the match for a result among the results
returned. For example, if more fields for an address match (including
house number, street, city, country/region, and postal code), the
relevance score is closer to 1.

Returned only when the partner selected is Esri or Grab.
