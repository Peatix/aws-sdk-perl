=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::AccessPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::AccessPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::AccessPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An access policy includes permissions that allow Amazon EKS to
authorize an IAM principal to work with Kubernetes objects on your
cluster. The policies are managed by Amazon EKS, but they're not IAM
policies. You can't view the permissions in the policies using the API.
The permissions for many of the policies are similar to the Kubernetes
C<cluster-admin>, C<admin>, C<edit>, and C<view> cluster roles. For
more information about these cluster roles, see User-facing roles
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#user-facing-roles)
in the Kubernetes documentation. To view the contents of the policies,
see Access policy permissions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-policies.html#access-policy-permissions)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
