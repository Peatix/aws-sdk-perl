=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::OidcIdentityProviderConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::OidcIdentityProviderConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientId => $value, ..., UsernamePrefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::OidcIdentityProviderConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the configuration for an OpenID Connect (OIDC)
identity provider.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientId => Str

This is also known as I<audience>. The ID of the client application
that makes authentication requests to the OIDC identity provider.


=head2 ClusterName => Str

The name of your cluster.


=head2 GroupsClaim => Str

The JSON web token (JWT) claim that the provider uses to return your
groups.


=head2 GroupsPrefix => Str

The prefix that is prepended to group claims to prevent clashes with
existing names (such as C<system:> groups). For example, the valueC<
oidc:> creates group names like C<oidc:engineering> and C<oidc:infra>.
The prefix can't contain C<system:>


=head2 IdentityProviderConfigArn => Str

The ARN of the configuration.


=head2 IdentityProviderConfigName => Str

The name of the configuration.


=head2 IssuerUrl => Str

The URL of the OIDC identity provider that allows the API server to
discover public signing keys for verifying tokens.


=head2 RequiredClaims => L<Paws::EKS::RequiredClaimsMap>

The key-value pairs that describe required claims in the identity
token. If set, each claim is verified to be present in the token with a
matching value.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the OIDC identity provider.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::EKS::TagMap>

Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.


=head2 UsernameClaim => Str

The JSON Web token (JWT) claim that is used as the username.


=head2 UsernamePrefix => Str

The prefix that is prepended to username claims to prevent clashes with
existing names. The prefix can't contain C<system:>
