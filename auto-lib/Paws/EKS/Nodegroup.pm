=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::Nodegroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::Nodegroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AmiType => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::Nodegroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AmiType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing an Amazon EKS managed node group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AmiType => Str

If the node group was deployed using a launch template with a custom
AMI, then this is C<CUSTOM>. For node groups that weren't deployed
using a launch template, this is the AMI type that was specified in the
node group configuration.


=head2 CapacityType => Str

The capacity type of your managed node group.


=head2 ClusterName => Str

The name of your cluster.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.


=head2 DiskSize => Int

If the node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then this is
the disk size in the node group configuration. If the node group was
deployed with a launch template, then this is C<null>.


=head2 Health => L<Paws::EKS::NodegroupHealth>

The health status of the node group. If there are issues with your node
group's health, they are listed here.


=head2 InstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If the node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then this is
the instance type that is associated with the node group. If the node
group was deployed with a launch template, then this is C<null>.


=head2 Labels => L<Paws::EKS::LabelsMap>

The Kubernetes C<labels> applied to the nodes in the node group.

Only C<labels> that are applied with the Amazon EKS API are shown here.
There may be other Kubernetes C<labels> applied to the nodes in this
group.


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::EKS::LaunchTemplateSpecification>

If a launch template was used to create the node group, then this is
the launch template that was used.


=head2 ModifiedAt => Str

The Unix epoch timestamp for the last modification to the object.


=head2 NodegroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the managed node group.


=head2 NodegroupName => Str

The name associated with an Amazon EKS managed node group.


=head2 NodeRepairConfig => L<Paws::EKS::NodeRepairConfig>

The node auto repair configuration for the node group.


=head2 NodeRole => Str

The IAM role associated with your node group. The Amazon EKS node
C<kubelet> daemon makes calls to Amazon Web Services APIs on your
behalf. Nodes receive permissions for these API calls through an IAM
instance profile and associated policies.


=head2 ReleaseVersion => Str

If the node group was deployed using a launch template with a custom
AMI, then this is the AMI ID that was specified in the launch template.
For node groups that weren't deployed using a launch template, this is
the version of the Amazon EKS optimized AMI that the node group was
deployed with.


=head2 RemoteAccess => L<Paws::EKS::RemoteAccessConfig>

If the node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then this is
the remote access configuration that is associated with the node group.
If the node group was deployed with a launch template, then this is
C<null>.


=head2 Resources => L<Paws::EKS::NodegroupResources>

The resources associated with the node group, such as Auto Scaling
groups and security groups for remote access.


=head2 ScalingConfig => L<Paws::EKS::NodegroupScalingConfig>

The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling group that is
associated with your node group.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the managed node group.


=head2 Subnets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The subnets that were specified for the Auto Scaling group that is
associated with your node group.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::EKS::TagMap>

Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.


=head2 Taints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EKS::Taint>]

The Kubernetes taints to be applied to the nodes in the node group when
they are created. Effect is one of C<No_Schedule>,
C<Prefer_No_Schedule>, or C<No_Execute>. Kubernetes taints can be used
together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled to
your nodes. For more information, see Node taints on managed node
groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/node-taints-managed-node-groups.html).


=head2 UpdateConfig => L<Paws::EKS::NodegroupUpdateConfig>

The node group update configuration.


=head2 Version => Str

The Kubernetes version of the managed node group.
