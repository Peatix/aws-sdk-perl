=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::VpcConfigRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::VpcConfigRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointPrivateAccess => $value, ..., SubnetIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::VpcConfigRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointPrivateAccess

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the VPC configuration to use for an Amazon EKS
cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndpointPrivateAccess => Bool

Set this value to C<true> to enable private access for your cluster's
Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you enable private access,
Kubernetes API requests from within your cluster's VPC use the private
VPC endpoint. The default value for this parameter is C<false>, which
disables private access for your Kubernetes API server. If you disable
private access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in the cluster, then
ensure that C<publicAccessCidrs> includes the necessary CIDR blocks for
communication with the nodes or Fargate pods. For more information, see
Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EKS User Guide> >.


=head2 EndpointPublicAccess => Bool

Set this value to C<false> to disable public access to your cluster's
Kubernetes API server endpoint. If you disable public access, your
cluster's Kubernetes API server can only receive requests from within
the cluster VPC. The default value for this parameter is C<true>, which
enables public access for your Kubernetes API server. For more
information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EKS User Guide> >.


=head2 PublicAccessCidrs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The CIDR blocks that are allowed access to your cluster's public
Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication to the endpoint from
addresses outside of the CIDR blocks that you specify is denied. The
default value is C<0.0.0.0/0>. If you've disabled private endpoint
access, make sure that you specify the necessary CIDR blocks for every
node and Fargate C<Pod> in the cluster. For more information, see
Amazon EKS cluster endpoint access control
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-endpoint.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EKS User Guide> >.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify one or more security groups for the cross-account elastic
network interfaces that Amazon EKS creates to use that allow
communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane. If
you don't specify any security groups, then familiarize yourself with
the difference between Amazon EKS defaults for clusters deployed with
Kubernetes. For more information, see Amazon EKS security group
considerations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EKS User Guide> >.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify subnets for your Amazon EKS nodes. Amazon EKS creates
cross-account elastic network interfaces in these subnets to allow
communication between your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.
