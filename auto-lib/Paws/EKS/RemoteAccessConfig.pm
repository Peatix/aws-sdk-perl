=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::RemoteAccessConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::RemoteAccessConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Ec2SshKey => $value, ..., SourceSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::RemoteAccessConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Ec2SshKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the remote access configuration for the managed
node group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Ec2SshKey => Str

The Amazon EC2 SSH key name that provides access for SSH communication
with the nodes in the managed node group. For more information, see
Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances>.
For Windows, an Amazon EC2 SSH key is used to obtain the RDP password.
For more information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Windows instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Windows
Instances>.


=head2 SourceSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The security group IDs that are allowed SSH access (port 22) to the
nodes. For Windows, the port is 3389. If you specify an Amazon EC2 SSH
key but don't specify a source security group when you create a managed
node group, then the port on the nodes is opened to the internet
(C<0.0.0.0/0>). For more information, see Security Groups for Your VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)
in the I<Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide>.
