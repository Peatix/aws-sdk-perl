=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::OutpostConfigRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::OutpostConfigRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ControlPlaneInstanceType => $value, ..., OutpostArns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::OutpostConfigRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ControlPlaneInstanceType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of your local Amazon EKS cluster on an Amazon Web
Services Outpost. Before creating a cluster on an Outpost, review
Creating a local cluster on an Outpost
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-outposts-local-cluster-create.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>. This API isn't available for Amazon
EKS clusters on the Amazon Web Services cloud.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ControlPlaneInstanceType => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type that you want to use for your local Amazon
EKS cluster on Outposts. Choose an instance type based on the number of
nodes that your cluster will have. For more information, see Capacity
considerations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-outposts-capacity-considerations.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>.

The instance type that you specify is used for all Kubernetes control
plane instances. The instance type can't be changed after cluster
creation. The control plane is not automatically scaled by Amazon EKS.


=head2 ControlPlanePlacement => L<Paws::EKS::ControlPlanePlacementRequest>

An object representing the placement configuration for all the control
plane instances of your local Amazon EKS cluster on an Amazon Web
Services Outpost. For more information, see Capacity considerations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-outposts-capacity-considerations.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutpostArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The ARN of the Outpost that you want to use for your local Amazon EKS
cluster on Outposts. Only a single Outpost ARN is supported.
