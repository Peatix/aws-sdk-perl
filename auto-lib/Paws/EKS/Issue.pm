=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::Issue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::Issue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., ResourceIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::Issue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing an issue with an Amazon EKS resource.

=head2 Code => Str

A brief description of the error.

=over

=item *

B<AccessDenied>: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes is
failing to authenticate or authorize with your Kubernetes cluster API
server.

=item *

B<AsgInstanceLaunchFailures>: Your Auto Scaling group is experiencing
failures while attempting to launch instances.

=item *

B<AutoScalingGroupNotFound>: We couldn't find the Auto Scaling group
associated with the managed node group. You may be able to recreate an
Auto Scaling group with the same settings to recover.

=item *

B<ClusterUnreachable>: Amazon EKS or one or more of your managed nodes
is unable to to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster API server.
This can happen if there are network disruptions or if API servers are
timing out processing requests.

=item *

B<Ec2InstanceTypeDoesNotExist>: One or more of the supplied Amazon EC2
instance types do not exist. Amazon EKS checked for the instance types
that you provided in this Amazon Web Services Region, and one or more
aren't available.

=item *

B<Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound>: We couldn't find the Amazon EC2 launch
template for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate a
launch template with the same settings to recover.

=item *

B<Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch>: The Amazon EC2 launch template
version for your managed node group does not match the version that
Amazon EKS created. You may be able to revert to the version that
Amazon EKS created to recover.

=item *

B<Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure>: We could not delete the remote
access security group for your managed node group. Remove any
dependencies from the security group.

=item *

B<Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound>: We couldn't find the cluster security
group for the cluster. You must recreate your cluster.

=item *

B<Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration>: One or more Amazon EC2 subnets
specified for a node group do not automatically assign public IP
addresses to instances launched into it. If you want your instances to
be assigned a public IP address, then you need to enable the
C<auto-assign public IP address> setting for the subnet. See Modifying
the public C<IPv4> addressing attribute for your subnet
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#subnet-public-ip)
in the I<Amazon VPC User Guide>.

=item *

B<IamInstanceProfileNotFound>: We couldn't find the IAM instance
profile for your managed node group. You may be able to recreate an
instance profile with the same settings to recover.

=item *

B<IamNodeRoleNotFound>: We couldn't find the IAM role for your managed
node group. You may be able to recreate an IAM role with the same
settings to recover.

=item *

B<InstanceLimitExceeded>: Your Amazon Web Services account is unable to
launch any more instances of the specified instance type. You may be
able to request an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover.

=item *

B<InsufficientFreeAddresses>: One or more of the subnets associated
with your managed node group does not have enough available IP
addresses for new nodes.

=item *

B<InternalFailure>: These errors are usually caused by an Amazon EKS
server-side issue.

=item *

B<NodeCreationFailure>: Your launched instances are unable to register
with your Amazon EKS cluster. Common causes of this failure are
insufficient node IAM role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html)
permissions or lack of outbound internet access for the nodes.
