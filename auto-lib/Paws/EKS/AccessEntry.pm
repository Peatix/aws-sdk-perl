=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::AccessEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::AccessEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessEntryArn => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::AccessEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessEntryArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An access entry allows an IAM principal (user or role) to access your
cluster. Access entries can replace the need to maintain the
C<aws-auth> C<ConfigMap> for authentication. For more information about
access entries, see Access entries
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/access-entries.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessEntryArn => Str

The ARN of the access entry.


=head2 ClusterName => Str

The name of your cluster.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.


=head2 KubernetesGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A C<name> that you've specified in a Kubernetes C<RoleBinding> or
C<ClusterRoleBinding> object so that Kubernetes authorizes the
C<principalARN> access to cluster objects.


=head2 ModifiedAt => Str

The Unix epoch timestamp for the last modification to the object.


=head2 PrincipalArn => Str

The ARN of the IAM principal for the access entry. If you ever delete
the IAM principal with this ARN, the access entry isn't automatically
deleted. We recommend that you delete the access entry with an ARN for
an IAM principal that you delete. If you don't delete the access entry
and ever recreate the IAM principal, even if it has the same ARN, the
access entry won't work. This is because even though the ARN is the
same for the recreated IAM principal, the C<roleID> or C<userID> (you
can see this with the Security Token Service C<GetCallerIdentity> API)
is different for the recreated IAM principal than it was for the
original IAM principal. Even though you don't see the IAM principal's
C<roleID> or C<userID> for an access entry, Amazon EKS stores it with
the access entry.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::EKS::TagMap>

Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag
consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't
propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of the access entry.


=head2 Username => Str

The C<name> of a user that can authenticate to your cluster.
