=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::LaunchTemplateSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::LaunchTemplateSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Id => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::LaunchTemplateSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a node group launch template specification. The
launch template can't include C<SubnetId>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetworkInterface.html),
C<IamInstanceProfile>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IamInstanceProfile.html),
C<RequestSpotInstances>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RequestSpotInstances.html),
C<HibernationOptions>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_HibernationOptionsRequest.html),
or C<TerminateInstances>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_TerminateInstances.html),
or the node group deployment or update will fail. For more information
about launch templates, see C<CreateLaunchTemplate>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLaunchTemplate.html)
in the Amazon EC2 API Reference. For more information about using
launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Customizing managed nodes with
launch templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide>.

You must specify either the launch template ID or the launch template
name in the request, but not both.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Id => Str

The ID of the launch template.

You must specify either the launch template ID or the launch template
name in the request, but not both. After node group creation, you
cannot use a different ID.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the launch template.

You must specify either the launch template name or the launch template
ID in the request, but not both. After node group creation, you cannot
use a different name.

specified, then the template's default version is used. You can use a
different version for node group updates.
