=head1 NAME

Paws::EKS::RemoteNodeNetwork

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EKS::RemoteNodeNetwork object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cidrs => $value, ..., Cidrs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EKS::RemoteNodeNetwork object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cidrs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A network CIDR that can contain hybrid nodes.

These CIDR blocks define the expected IP address range of the hybrid
nodes that join the cluster. These blocks are typically determined by
your network administrator.

Enter one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks in decimal dotted-quad notation (for
example, C< 10.2.0.0/16>).

It must satisfy the following requirements:

=over

=item *

Each block must be within an C<IPv4> RFC-1918 network range. Minimum
allowed size is /24, maximum allowed size is /8. Publicly-routable
addresses aren't supported.

=item *

Each block cannot overlap with the range of the VPC CIDR blocks for
your EKS resources, or the block of the Kubernetes service IP range.

=item *

Each block must have a route to the VPC that uses the VPC CIDR blocks,
not public IPs or Elastic IPs. There are many options including Transit
Gateway, Site-to-Site VPN, or Direct Connect.

=item *

Each host must allow outbound connection to the EKS cluster control
plane on TCP ports C<443> and C<10250>.

=item *

Each host must allow inbound connection from the EKS cluster control
plane on TCP port 10250 for logs, exec and port-forward operations.

=item *

Each host must allow TCP and UDP network connectivity to and from other
hosts that are running C<CoreDNS> on UDP port C<53> for service and pod
DNS names.
