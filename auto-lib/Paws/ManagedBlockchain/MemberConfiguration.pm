=head1 NAME

Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration properties of the member.

Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Description => Str

An optional description of the member.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FrameworkConfiguration => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberFrameworkConfiguration>

Configuration properties of the blockchain framework relevant to the
member.


=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed key in Key
Management Service (KMS) to use for encryption at rest in the member.
This parameter is inherited by any nodes that this member creates. For
more information, see Encryption at Rest
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/hyperledger-fabric-dev/managed-blockchain-encryption-at-rest.html)
in the I<Amazon Managed Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric Developer Guide>.

Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

=over

=item *

B<Undefined or empty string> - By default, use an KMS key that is owned
and managed by Amazon Web Services on your behalf.

=item *

B<A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key> - Use the specified KMS
key in your account that you create, own, and manage.

Amazon Managed Blockchain doesn't support asymmetric keys. For more
information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.

The following is an example of a KMS key ARN:
C<arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>

=back



=head2 LogPublishingConfiguration => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberLogPublishingConfiguration>

Configuration properties for logging events associated with a member of
a Managed Blockchain network.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the member.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchain::InputTagMap>

Tags assigned to the member. Tags consist of a key and optional value.

When specifying tags during creation, you can specify multiple
key-value pairs in a single request, with an overall maximum of 50 tags
added to each resource.

For more information about tags, see Tagging Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/latest/ethereum-dev/tagging-resources.html)
in the I<Amazon Managed Blockchain Ethereum Developer Guide>, or
