=head1 NAME

Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ManagedBlockchain::MemberSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of configuration properties for a member.

Applies only to Hyperledger Fabric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the member. For more information
about ARNs and their format, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time that the member was created.


=head2 Description => Str

An optional description of the member.


=head2 Id => Str

The unique identifier of the member.


=head2 IsOwned => Bool

An indicator of whether the member is owned by your Amazon Web Services
account or a different Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the member.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the member.

=over

=item *

C<CREATING> - The Amazon Web Services account is in the process of
creating a member.

=item *

C<AVAILABLE> - The member has been created and can participate in the
network.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED> - The Amazon Web Services account attempted to create
a member and creation failed.

=item *

C<UPDATING> - The member is in the process of being updated.

=item *

C<DELETING> - The member and all associated resources are in the
process of being deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services account that
owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted as the
result of an C<APPROVED> C<PROPOSAL> to remove the member.

=item *

C<DELETED> - The member can no longer participate on the network and
all associated resources are deleted. Either the Amazon Web Services
account that owns the member deleted it, or the member is being deleted
as the result of an C<APPROVED> C<PROPOSAL> to remove the member.

=item *

C<INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_KEY> - The member is impaired and might not
function as expected because it cannot access the specified customer
managed key in Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption at rest.
Either the KMS key was disabled or deleted, or the grants on the key
were revoked.

The effect of disabling or deleting a key or of revoking a grant isn't
immediate. It might take some time for the member resource to discover
that the key is inaccessible. When a resource is in this state, we
recommend deleting and recreating the resource.
