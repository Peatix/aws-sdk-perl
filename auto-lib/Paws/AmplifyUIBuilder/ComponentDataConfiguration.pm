=head1 NAME

Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentDataConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentDataConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifiers => $value, ..., Sort => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentDataConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifiers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration for binding a component's properties to
data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Identifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of IDs to use to bind data to a component. Use this property to
bind specifically chosen data, rather than data retrieved from a query.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Model => Str

The name of the data model to use to bind data to a component.


=head2 Predicate => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::Predicate>

Represents the conditional logic to use when binding data to a
component. Use this property to retrieve only a subset of the data in a
collection.


=head2 Sort => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::SortProperty>]

Describes how to sort the component's properties.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder>
