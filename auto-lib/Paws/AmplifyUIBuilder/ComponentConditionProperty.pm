=head1 NAME

Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentConditionProperty

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentConditionProperty object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Else => $value, ..., Then => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentConditionProperty object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Else

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a conditional expression to set a component property. Use
C<ComponentConditionProperty> to set a property to different values
conditionally, based on the value of another property.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Else => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentProperty>

The value to assign to the property if the condition is not met.


=head2 Field => Str

The name of a field. Specify this when the property is a data model.


=head2 Operand => Str

The value of the property to evaluate.


=head2 OperandType => Str

The type of the property to evaluate.


=head2 Operator => Str

The operator to use to perform the evaluation, such as C<eq> to
represent equals.


=head2 Property => Str

The name of the conditional property.


=head2 Then => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentProperty>

The value to assign to the property if the condition is met.
