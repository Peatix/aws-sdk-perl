=head1 NAME

Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::Component

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::Component object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppId => $value, ..., Variants => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::Component object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the configuration settings for a user interface (UI) element
for an Amplify app. A component is configured as a primary, stand-alone
UI element. Use C<ComponentChild> to configure an instance of a
C<Component>. A C<ComponentChild> instance inherits the configuration
of the main C<Component>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppId => Str

The unique ID of the Amplify app associated with the component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BindingProperties => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentBindingProperties>

The information to connect a component's properties to data at runtime.
You can't specify C<tags> as a valid property for C<bindingProperties>.


=head2 Children => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentChild>]

A list of the component's C<ComponentChild> instances.


=head2 CollectionProperties => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentCollectionProperties>

The data binding configuration for the component's properties. Use this
for a collection component. You can't specify C<tags> as a valid
property for C<collectionProperties>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComponentType => Str

The type of the component. This can be an Amplify custom UI component
or another custom component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The time that the component was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnvironmentName => Str

The name of the backend environment that is a part of the Amplify app.


=head2 Events => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentEvents>

Describes the events that can be raised on the component. Use for the
workflow feature in Amplify Studio that allows you to bind events and
actions to components.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The unique ID of the component.


=head2 ModifiedAt => Str

The time that the component was modified.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Overrides => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentOverrides>

Describes the component's properties that can be overriden in a
customized instance of the component. You can't specify C<tags> as a
valid property for C<overrides>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Properties => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentProperties>

Describes the component's properties. You can't specify C<tags> as a
valid property for C<properties>.


=head2 SchemaVersion => Str

The schema version of the component when it was imported.


=head2 SourceId => Str

The unique ID of the component in its original source system, such as
Figma.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::Tags>

One or more key-value pairs to use when tagging the component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Variants => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::ComponentVariant>]

A list of the component's variants. A variant is a unique style
configuration of a main component.
