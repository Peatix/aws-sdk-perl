=head1 NAME

Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::FileUploaderFieldConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::FileUploaderFieldConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AcceptedFileTypes => $value, ..., ShowThumbnails => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AmplifyUIBuilder::FileUploaderFieldConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AcceptedFileTypes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration for the file uploader field.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AcceptedFileTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The file types that are allowed to be uploaded by the file uploader.
Provide this information in an array of strings specifying the valid
file extensions.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessLevel => Str

The access level to assign to the uploaded files in the Amazon S3
bucket where they are stored. The valid values for this property are
C<private>, C<protected>, or C<public>. For detailed information about
the permissions associated with each access level, see File access
levels
(https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/configureaccess/q/platform/js/)
in the I<Amplify documentation>.


=head2 IsResumable => Bool

Allows the file upload operation to be paused and resumed. The default
value is C<false>.

When C<isResumable> is set to C<true>, the file uploader uses a
multipart upload to break the files into chunks before upload. The
progress of the upload isn't continuous, because the file uploader
uploads a chunk at a time.


=head2 MaxFileCount => Int

Specifies the maximum number of files that can be selected to upload.
The default value is an unlimited number of files.


=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum file size in bytes that the file uploader will accept. The
default value is an unlimited file size.


=head2 ShowThumbnails => Bool

Specifies whether to display or hide the image preview after selecting
a file for upload. The default value is C<true> to display the image
preview.
