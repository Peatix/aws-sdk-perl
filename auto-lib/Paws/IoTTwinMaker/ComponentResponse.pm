=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTTwinMaker::ComponentResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTTwinMaker::ComponentResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AreAllCompositeComponentsReturned => $value, ..., SyncSource => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTTwinMaker::ComponentResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AreAllCompositeComponentsReturned

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that returns information about a component type create or
update request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AreAllCompositeComponentsReturned => Bool

This flag notes whether all C<compositeComponents> are returned in the
API response.


=head2 AreAllPropertiesReturned => Bool

This flag notes whether all properties of the component are returned in
the API response. The maximum number of properties returned is 800.


=head2 ComponentName => Str

The name of the component.


=head2 ComponentTypeId => Str

The ID of the component type.


=head2 CompositeComponents => L<Paws::IoTTwinMaker::CompositeComponentResponse>

This lists objects that contain information about the
C<compositeComponents>.


=head2 DefinedIn => Str

The name of the property definition set in the request.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the component type.


=head2 Properties => L<Paws::IoTTwinMaker::PropertyResponses>

An object that maps strings to the properties to set in the component
type. Each string in the mapping must be unique to this object.


=head2 PropertyGroups => L<Paws::IoTTwinMaker::ComponentPropertyGroupResponses>

The property groups.


=head2 Status => L<Paws::IoTTwinMaker::Status>

The status of the component type.


=head2 SyncSource => Str

The syncSource of the sync job, if this entity was created by a sync
job.
