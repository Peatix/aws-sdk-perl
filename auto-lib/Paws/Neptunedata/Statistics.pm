=head1 NAME

Paws::Neptunedata::Statistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Neptunedata::Statistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Active => $value, ..., StatisticsId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Neptunedata::Statistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Active

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains statistics information. The DFE engine uses information about
the data in your Neptune graph to make effective trade-offs when
planning query execution. This information takes the form of statistics
that include so-called characteristic sets and predicate statistics
that can guide query planning. See Managing statistics for the Neptune
DFE to use
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/neptune-dfe-statistics.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Active => Bool

Indicates whether or not DFE statistics generation is enabled at all.


=head2 AutoCompute => Bool

Indicates whether or not automatic statistics generation is enabled.


=head2 Date => Str

The UTC time at which DFE statistics have most recently been generated.


=head2 Note => Str

A note about problems in the case where statistics are invalid.


=head2 SignatureInfo => L<Paws::Neptunedata::StatisticsSummary>

A StatisticsSummary structure that contains:

=over

=item *

C<signatureCount> - The total number of signatures across all
characteristic sets.

=item *

C<instanceCount> - The total number of characteristic-set instances.

=item *

C<predicateCount> - The total number of unique predicates.

=back



=head2 StatisticsId => Str

Reports the ID of the current statistics generation run. A value of -1
indicates that no statistics have been generated.
