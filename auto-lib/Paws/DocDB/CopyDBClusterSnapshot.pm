=head1 NAME

Paws::DocDB::CopyDBClusterSnapshot - Arguments for method CopyDBClusterSnapshot on L<Paws::DocDB>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CopyDBClusterSnapshot on the
L<Amazon DocumentDB with MongoDB compatibility|Paws::DocDB> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CopyDBClusterSnapshot.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CopyDBClusterSnapshot.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rds = Paws->service('DocDB');
    my $CopyDBClusterSnapshotResult = $rds->CopyDBClusterSnapshot(
      SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier => 'MyString',
      TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier => 'MyString',
      CopyTags                          => 1,             # OPTIONAL
      KmsKeyId                          => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL
      PreSignedUrl                      => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags                              => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyString',
          Value => 'MyString',
        },
        ...
      ],                                                  # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DBClusterSnapshot = $CopyDBClusterSnapshotResult->DBClusterSnapshot;

    # Returns a L<Paws::DocDB::CopyDBClusterSnapshotResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyTags => Bool

Set to C<true> to copy all tags from the source cluster snapshot to the
target cluster snapshot, and otherwise C<false>. The default is
C<false>.



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The KMS key ID for an encrypted cluster snapshot. The KMS key ID is the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KMS key identifier, or the KMS key alias
for the KMS encryption key.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services
account, you can specify a value for C<KmsKeyId> to encrypt the copy
with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for
C<KmsKeyId>, then the copy of the cluster snapshot is encrypted with
the same KMS key as the source cluster snapshot.

If you copy an encrypted cluster snapshot that is shared from another
Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for
C<KmsKeyId>.

To copy an encrypted cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services
Region, set C<KmsKeyId> to the KMS key ID that you want to use to
encrypt the copy of the cluster snapshot in the destination Region. KMS
encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that
they are created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon
Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region.

If you copy an unencrypted cluster snapshot and specify a value for the
C<KmsKeyId> parameter, an error is returned.



=head2 PreSignedUrl => Str

The URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for
theC<CopyDBClusterSnapshot> API action in the Amazon Web Services
Region that contains the source cluster snapshot to copy. You must use
the C<PreSignedUrl> parameter when copying a cluster snapshot from
another Amazon Web Services Region.

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
specify C<SourceRegion> (or C<--source-region> for the CLI) instead of
specifying C<PreSignedUrl> manually. Specifying C<SourceRegion>
autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for the
operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Services
Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
C<CopyDBClusterSnapshot> API action that can be executed in the source
Amazon Web Services Region that contains the cluster snapshot to be
copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter
values:

=over

=item *

C<SourceRegion> - The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be
copied.

=item *

C<SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier> - The identifier for the the
encrypted cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services
Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted cluster snapshot
from the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
C<SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier> looks something like the
following:
C<arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:12345678012:sample-cluster:sample-cluster-snapshot>.

=item *

C<TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier> - The identifier for the new
cluster snapshot to be created. This parameter isn't case sensitive.

=back




=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier => Str

The identifier of the cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is not
case sensitive.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must specify a valid system snapshot in the I<available> state.

=item *

If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the
copy, specify a valid snapshot identifier.

=item *

If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region
than the copy, specify a valid cluster snapshot ARN.

=back

Example: C<my-cluster-snapshot1>



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DocDB::Tag>]

The tags to be assigned to the cluster snapshot.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier => Str

The identifier of the new cluster snapshot to create from the source
cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case sensitive.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

=item *

The first character must be a letter.

=item *

Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

=back

Example: C<my-cluster-snapshot2>
