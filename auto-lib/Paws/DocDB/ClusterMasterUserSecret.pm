=head1 NAME

Paws::DocDB::ClusterMasterUserSecret

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DocDB::ClusterMasterUserSecret object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyId => $value, ..., SecretStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DocDB::ClusterMasterUserSecret object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the secret managed by Amazon DocumentDB in Amazon Web Services
Secrets Manager for the master user password.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the
secret.


=head2 SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.


=head2 SecretStatus => Str

The status of the secret.

The possible status values include the following:

=over

=item *

creating - The secret is being created.

=item *

active - The secret is available for normal use and rotation.

=item *

rotating - The secret is being rotated.

=item *

impaired - The secret can be used to access database credentials, but
it can't be rotated. A secret might have this status if, for example,
permissions are changed so that Amazon DocumentDB can no longer access
either the secret or the KMS key for the secret.

When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that
caused the status. Alternatively, modify the instance to turn off
automatic management of database credentials, and then modify the
instance again to turn on automatic management of database credentials.
