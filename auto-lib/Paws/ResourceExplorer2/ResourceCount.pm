=head1 NAME

Paws::ResourceExplorer2::ResourceCount

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ResourceExplorer2::ResourceCount object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Complete => $value, ..., TotalResources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ResourceExplorer2::ResourceCount object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Complete

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the number of results that match the query. At this
time, Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer doesn't count more than
1,000 matches for any query. This structure provides information about
whether the query exceeded this limit.

This field is included in every page when you paginate the results.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Complete => Bool

Indicates whether the C<TotalResources> value represents an exhaustive
count of search results.

=over

=item *

If C<True>, it indicates that the search was exhaustive. Every resource
that matches the query was counted.

=item *

If C<False>, then the search reached the limit of 1,000 matching
results, and stopped counting.

=back



=head2 TotalResources => Int

The number of resources that match the search query. This value can't
exceed 1,000. If there are more than 1,000 resources that match the
query, then only 1,000 are counted and the C<Complete> field is set to
false. We recommend that you refine your query to return a smaller
number of results.
