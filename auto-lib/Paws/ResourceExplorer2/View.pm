=head1 NAME

Paws::ResourceExplorer2::View

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ResourceExplorer2::View object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filters => $value, ..., ViewArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ResourceExplorer2::View object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A view is a structure that defines a set of filters that provide a view
into the information in the Amazon Web Services Resource Explorer
index. The filters specify which information from the index is visible
to the users of the view. For example, you can specify filters that
include only resources that are tagged with the key "ENV" and the value
"DEVELOPMENT" in the results returned by this view. You could also
create a second view that includes only resources that are tagged with
"ENV" and "PRODUCTION".
