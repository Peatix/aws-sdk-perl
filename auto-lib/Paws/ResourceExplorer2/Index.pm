=head1 NAME

Paws::ResourceExplorer2::Index

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ResourceExplorer2::Index object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ResourceExplorer2::Index object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An index is the data store used by Amazon Web Services Resource
Explorer to hold information about your Amazon Web Services resources
that the service discovers. Creating an index in an Amazon Web Services
Region turns on Resource Explorer and lets it discover your resources.

By default, an index is I<local>, meaning that it contains information
about resources in only the same Region as the index. However, you can
promote the index of one Region in the account by calling
UpdateIndexType to convert it into an aggregator index. The aggregator
index receives a replicated copy of the index information from all
other Regions where Resource Explorer is turned on. This allows search
operations in that Region to return results from all Regions in the
account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon resource name (ARN)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
of the index.


=head2 Region => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region in which the index exists.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of index. It can be one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<LOCAL> E<ndash> The index contains information about resources from
only the same Amazon Web Services Region.

=item *

C<AGGREGATOR> E<ndash> Resource Explorer replicates copies of the
indexed information about resources in all other Amazon Web Services
Regions to the aggregator index. This lets search results in the Region
with the aggregator index to include resources from all Regions in the
account where Resource Explorer is turned on.
