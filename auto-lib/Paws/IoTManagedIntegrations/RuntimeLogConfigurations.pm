=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::RuntimeLogConfigurations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::RuntimeLogConfigurations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteLocalStoreAfterUpload => $value, ..., UploadPeriodMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::RuntimeLogConfigurations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteLocalStoreAfterUpload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The different configurations for runtime logs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteLocalStoreAfterUpload => Bool

Configuration to enable or disable deleting of runtime logs in the
device once uploaded to the cloud.


=head2 LocalStoreFileRotationMaxBytes => Int

Configuration to set the maximum bytes of runtime logs that can be
stored on the device before the oldest logs are deleted or overwritten.


=head2 LocalStoreFileRotationMaxFiles => Int

Configuration to set the maximum number of runtime log files that can
be stored on the device before the oldest files are deleted or
overwritten.


=head2 LocalStoreLocation => Str

Configuration of where to store runtime logs in the device.


=head2 LogFlushLevel => Str

The different log levels available for configuration.


=head2 LogLevel => Str

The different log levels available for configuration.


=head2 UploadLog => Bool

Configuration to enable or disable uploading of runtime logs to the
cloud.


=head2 UploadPeriodMinutes => Int

Configuration to set the time interval in minutes between each batch of
runtime logs that the device uploads to the cloud.
