=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::ManagedThingSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::ManagedThingSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivatedAt => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTManagedIntegrations::ManagedThingSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Structure representing one managed thing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActivatedAt => Str

The timestampe value of when the managed thing was activated at.


=head2 AdvertisedProductId => Str

The id of the advertised product.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the managed thing.


=head2 Brand => Str

The brand of the device.


=head2 Classification => Str

The classification of the managed thing such as light bulb or
thermostat.


=head2 ConnectorDeviceId => Str

The third-party device id as defined by the connector. This device id
must not contain personal identifiable information (PII).

The id of the device.


=head2 Model => Str

The model of the device.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the managed thing representing the physical device.


=head2 Owner => Str

Owner of the device, usually an indication of whom the device belongs
to. This value should not contain personal identifiable information.


=head2 ParentControllerId => Str

Id of the controller device used for the discovery job.


=head2 ProvisioningStatus => Str

The provisioning status of the device in the provisioning workflow for
onboarding to IoT managed integrations.


=head2 Role => Str

The type of device used. This will be the Amazon Web Services hub
controller, cloud device, or IoT device.
