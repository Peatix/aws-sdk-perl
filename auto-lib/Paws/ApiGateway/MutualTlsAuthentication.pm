=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGateway::MutualTlsAuthentication

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApiGateway::MutualTlsAuthentication object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TruststoreUri => $value, ..., TruststoreWarnings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApiGateway::MutualTlsAuthentication object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TruststoreUri

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The mutual TLS authentication configuration for a custom domain name.
If specified, API Gateway performs two-way authentication between the
client and the server. Clients must present a trusted certificate to
access your API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TruststoreUri => Str

An Amazon S3 URL that specifies the truststore for mutual TLS
authentication, for example C<s3://bucket-name/key-name>. The
truststore can contain certificates from public or private certificate
authorities. To update the truststore, upload a new version to S3, and
then update your custom domain name to use the new version. To update
the truststore, you must have permissions to access the S3 object.


=head2 TruststoreVersion => Str

The version of the S3 object that contains your truststore. To specify
a version, you must have versioning enabled for the S3 bucket.


=head2 TruststoreWarnings => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of warnings that API Gateway returns while processing your
truststore. Invalid certificates produce warnings. Mutual TLS is still
enabled, but some clients might not be able to access your API. To
resolve warnings, upload a new truststore to S3, and then update you
domain name to use the new version.
