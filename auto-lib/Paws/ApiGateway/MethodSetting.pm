=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGateway::MethodSetting

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApiGateway::MethodSetting object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CacheDataEncrypted => $value, ..., UnauthorizedCacheControlHeaderStrategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApiGateway::MethodSetting object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CacheDataEncrypted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the method setting properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CacheDataEncrypted => Bool

Specifies whether the cached responses are encrypted.


=head2 CacheTtlInSeconds => Int

Specifies the time to live (TTL), in seconds, for cached responses. The
higher the TTL, the longer the response will be cached.


=head2 CachingEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether responses should be cached and returned for requests.
A cache cluster must be enabled on the stage for responses to be
cached.


=head2 DataTraceEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether data trace logging is enabled for this method, which
affects the log entries pushed to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. This can be
useful to troubleshoot APIs, but can result in logging sensitive data.
We recommend that you don't enable this option for production APIs.


=head2 LoggingLevel => Str

Specifies the logging level for this method, which affects the log
entries pushed to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Valid values are C<OFF>,
C<ERROR>, and C<INFO>. Choose C<ERROR> to write only error-level
entries to CloudWatch Logs, or choose C<INFO> to include all C<ERROR>
events as well as extra informational events.


=head2 MetricsEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether Amazon CloudWatch metrics are enabled for this
method.


=head2 RequireAuthorizationForCacheControl => Bool

Specifies whether authorization is required for a cache invalidation
request.


=head2 ThrottlingBurstLimit => Int

Specifies the throttling burst limit.


=head2 ThrottlingRateLimit => Num

Specifies the throttling rate limit.


=head2 UnauthorizedCacheControlHeaderStrategy => Str

Specifies how to handle unauthorized requests for cache invalidation.
