=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGateway::PatchOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApiGateway::PatchOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { From => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApiGateway::PatchOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->From

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For more information about supported patch operations, see Patch
Operations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/patch-operations.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 From => Str

The copy update operation's source as identified by a JSON-Pointer
value referencing the location within the targeted resource to copy the
value from. For example, to promote a canary deployment, you copy the
canary deployment ID to the affiliated deployment ID by calling a PATCH
request on a Stage resource with "op":"copy",
"from":"/canarySettings/deploymentId" and "path":"/deploymentId".


=head2 Op => Str

An update operation to be performed with this PATCH request. The valid
value can be add, remove, replace or copy. Not all valid operations are
supported for a given resource. Support of the operations depends on
specific operational contexts. Attempts to apply an unsupported
operation on a resource will return an error message..


=head2 Path => Str

The op operation's target, as identified by a JSON Pointer value that
references a location within the targeted resource. For example, if the
target resource has an updateable property of {"name":"value"}, the
path for this property is /name. If the name property value is a JSON
object (e.g., {"name": {"child/name": "child-value"}}), the path for
the child/name property will be /name/child~1name. Any slash ("/")
character appearing in path names must be escaped with "~1", as shown
in the example above. Each op operation can have only one path
associated with it.


=head2 Value => Str

The new target value of the update operation. It is applicable for the
add or replace operation. When using AWS CLI to update a property of a
JSON value, enclose the JSON object with a pair of single quotes in a
Linux shell, e.g., '{"a": ...}'.
