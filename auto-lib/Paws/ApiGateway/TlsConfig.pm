=head1 NAME

Paws::ApiGateway::TlsConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApiGateway::TlsConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InsecureSkipVerification => $value, ..., InsecureSkipVerification => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApiGateway::TlsConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InsecureSkipVerification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the TLS configuration for an integration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InsecureSkipVerification => Bool

Specifies whether or not API Gateway skips verification that the
certificate for an integration endpoint is issued by a supported
certificate authority. This isnE<rsquo>t recommended, but it enables
you to use certificates that are signed by private certificate
authorities, or certificates that are self-signed. If enabled, API
Gateway still performs basic certificate validation, which includes
checking the certificate's expiration date, hostname, and presence of a
root certificate authority. Supported only for C<HTTP> and
C<HTTP_PROXY> integrations.

Enabling C<insecureSkipVerification> isn't recommended, especially for
integrations with public HTTPS endpoints. If you enable
C<insecureSkipVerification>, you increase the risk of man-in-the-middle
attacks.
