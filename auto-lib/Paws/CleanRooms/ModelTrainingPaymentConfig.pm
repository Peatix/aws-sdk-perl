=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the collaboration member's model training
payment responsibilities set by the collaboration creator.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IsResponsible => Bool

Indicates whether the collaboration creator has configured the
collaboration member to pay for model training costs (C<TRUE>) or has
not configured the collaboration member to pay for model training costs
(C<FALSE>).

Exactly one member can be configured to pay for model training costs.
An error is returned if the collaboration creator sets a C<TRUE> value
for more than one member in the collaboration.

If the collaboration creator hasn't specified anyone as the member
paying for model training costs, then the member who can query is the
default payer. An error is returned if the collaboration creator sets a
C<FALSE> value for the member who can query.
