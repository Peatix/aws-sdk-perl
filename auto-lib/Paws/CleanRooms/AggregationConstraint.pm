=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRooms::AggregationConstraint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRooms::AggregationConstraint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ColumnName => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRooms::AggregationConstraint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ColumnName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Constraint on query output removing output rows that do not meet a
minimum number of distinct values of a specified column.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ColumnName => Str

Column in aggregation constraint for which there must be a minimum
number of distinct values in an output row for it to be in the query
output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Minimum => Int

The minimum number of distinct values that an output row must be an
aggregation of. Minimum threshold of distinct values for a specified
column that must exist in an output row for it to be in the query
output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of aggregation the constraint allows. The only valid value is
currently `COUNT_DISTINCT`.
