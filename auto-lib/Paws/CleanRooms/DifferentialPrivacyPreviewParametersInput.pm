=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRooms::DifferentialPrivacyPreviewParametersInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRooms::DifferentialPrivacyPreviewParametersInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Epsilon => $value, ..., UsersNoisePerQuery => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRooms::DifferentialPrivacyPreviewParametersInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Epsilon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The epsilon and noise parameters that you want to preview.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Epsilon => Int

The epsilon value that you want to preview.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UsersNoisePerQuery => Int

Noise added per query is measured in terms of the number of users whose
contributions you want to obscure. This value governs the rate at which
the privacy budget is depleted.
