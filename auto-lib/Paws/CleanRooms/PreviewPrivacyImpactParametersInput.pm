=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRooms::PreviewPrivacyImpactParametersInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRooms::PreviewPrivacyImpactParametersInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DifferentialPrivacy => $value, ..., DifferentialPrivacy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRooms::PreviewPrivacyImpactParametersInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DifferentialPrivacy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the updated epsilon and noise parameters to preview. The
preview allows you to see how the maximum number of each type of
aggregation function would change with the new parameters.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DifferentialPrivacy => L<Paws::CleanRooms::DifferentialPrivacyPreviewParametersInput>
