=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRooms::AnalysisRuleAggregation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRooms::AnalysisRuleAggregation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalAnalyses => $value, ..., ScalarFunctions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRooms::AnalysisRuleAggregation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalAnalyses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A type of analysis rule that enables query structure and specified
queries that produce aggregate statistics.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalAnalyses => Str

An indicator as to whether additional analyses (such as Clean Rooms ML)
can be applied to the output of the direct query.

The C<additionalAnalyses> parameter is currently supported for the list
analysis rule (C<AnalysisRuleList>) and the custom analysis rule
(C<AnalysisRuleCustom>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AggregateColumns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CleanRooms::AggregateColumn>]

The columns that query runners are allowed to use in aggregation
queries.


=head2 AllowedJoinOperators => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Which logical operators (if any) are to be used in an INNER JOIN match
condition. Default is C<AND>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DimensionColumns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The columns that query runners are allowed to select, group by, or
filter by.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JoinColumns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Columns in configured table that can be used in join statements and/or
as aggregate columns. They can never be outputted directly.


=head2 JoinRequired => Str

Control that requires member who runs query to do a join with their
configured table and/or other configured table in query.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputConstraints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CleanRooms::AggregationConstraint>]

Columns that must meet a specific threshold value (after an aggregation
function is applied to it) for each output row to be returned.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScalarFunctions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Set of scalar functions that are allowed to be used on dimension
columns and the output of aggregation of metrics.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::CleanRooms>
