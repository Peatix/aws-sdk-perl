=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRooms::DataEncryptionMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRooms::DataEncryptionMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowCleartext => $value, ..., PreserveNulls => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRooms::DataEncryptionMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowCleartext

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings for client-side encryption for cryptographic computing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowCleartext => Bool

Indicates whether encrypted tables can contain cleartext data (C<TRUE>)
or are to cryptographically process every column (C<FALSE>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowDuplicates => Bool

Indicates whether Fingerprint columns can contain duplicate entries
(C<TRUE>) or are to contain only non-repeated values (C<FALSE>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowJoinsOnColumnsWithDifferentNames => Bool

Indicates whether Fingerprint columns can be joined on any other
Fingerprint column with a different name (C<TRUE>) or can only be
joined on Fingerprint columns of the same name (C<FALSE>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PreserveNulls => Bool

Indicates whether NULL values are to be copied as NULL to encrypted
tables (C<TRUE>) or cryptographically processed (C<FALSE>).
