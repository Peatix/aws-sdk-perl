  $result->Att1->Reasons

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The status details of the analysis template validation. Clean Rooms
Differential Privacy uses a general-purpose query structure to support
complex SQL queries and validates whether an analysis template fits
that general-purpose query structure. Validation is performed when
analysis templates are created and fetched. Because analysis templates
are immutable by design, we recommend that you create analysis
templates after you associate the configured tables with their analysis
rule to your collaboration.
