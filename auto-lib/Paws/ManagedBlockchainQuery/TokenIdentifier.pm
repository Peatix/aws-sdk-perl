=head1 NAME

Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenIdentifier

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenIdentifier object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContractAddress => $value, ..., TokenId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenIdentifier object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContractAddress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The container for the identifier for the token including the unique
token ID and its blockchain network.

Only the native tokens BTC and ETH, and the ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC
1155 token standards are supported.

=head2 ContractAddress => Str

This is the token's contract address.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Network => Str
