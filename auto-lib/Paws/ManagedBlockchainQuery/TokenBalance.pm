=head1 NAME

Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenBalance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenBalance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AtBlockchainInstant => $value, ..., TokenIdentifier => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenBalance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AtBlockchainInstant

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The balance of the token.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AtBlockchainInstant => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::BlockchainInstant>

The time for when the TokenBalance is requested or the current time if
a time is not provided in the request.

This time will only be recorded up to the second.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Balance => Str

The container of the token balance.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::BlockchainInstant>

The C<Timestamp> of the last transaction at which the balance for the
token in the wallet was updated.


=head2 OwnerIdentifier => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::OwnerIdentifier>

The container for the identifier of the owner.


=head2 TokenIdentifier => L<Paws::ManagedBlockchainQuery::TokenIdentifier>

The identifier for the token, including the unique token ID and its
blockchain network.
