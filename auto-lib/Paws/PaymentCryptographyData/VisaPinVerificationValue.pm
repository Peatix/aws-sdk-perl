=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::VisaPinVerificationValue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::VisaPinVerificationValue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptedPinBlock => $value, ..., PinVerificationKeyIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::VisaPinVerificationValue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptedPinBlock

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters that are required to generate or verify Visa PVV (PIN
Verification Value).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncryptedPinBlock => Str

The encrypted PIN block data to verify.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PinVerificationKeyIndex => Int

The value for PIN verification index. It is used in the Visa PIN
algorithm to calculate the PVV (PIN Verification Value).
