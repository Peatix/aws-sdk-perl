=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EcdhDerivationAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EcdhDerivationAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => $value, ..., SharedInformation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EcdhDerivationAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters required to establish ECDH based key exchange.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<keyArn> of the certificate that signed the client's
C<PublicKeyCertificate>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAlgorithm => Str

The key algorithm of the derived ECDH key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyDerivationFunction => Str

The key derivation function to use for deriving a key using ECDH.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyDerivationHashAlgorithm => Str

The hash type to use for deriving a key using ECDH.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PublicKeyCertificate => Str

The client's public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) to
use for ECDH key derivation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SharedInformation => Str

A byte string containing information that binds the ECDH derived key to
the two parties involved or to the context of the key.

It may include details like identities of the two parties deriving the
key, context of the operation, session IDs, and optionally a nonce. It
must not contain zero bytes, and re-using shared information for
multiple ECDH key derivations is not recommended.
