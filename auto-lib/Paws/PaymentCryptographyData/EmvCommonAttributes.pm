=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvCommonAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvCommonAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplicationCryptogram => $value, ..., PrimaryAccountNumber => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvCommonAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplicationCryptogram

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters to derive the confidentiality and integrity keys for an Emv
common payment card.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationCryptogram => Str

The application cryptogram for the current transaction that is provided
by the terminal during transaction processing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MajorKeyDerivationMode => Str

The method to use when deriving the master key for the payment card.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Mode => Str

The block cipher method to use for encryption.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PanSequenceNumber => Str

A number that identifies and differentiates payment cards with the same
Primary Account Number (PAN). Typically 00 is used, if no value is
provided by the terminal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PinBlockLengthPosition => Str

Specifies if PIN block length should be added to front of the pin
block.

If value is set to C<FRONT_OF_PIN_BLOCK>, then PIN block padding type
should be C<ISO_IEC_7816_4>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PinBlockPaddingType => Str

The padding to be added to the PIN block prior to encryption.

Padding type should be C<ISO_IEC_7816_4>, if C<PinBlockLengthPosition>
is set to C<FRONT_OF_PIN_BLOCK>. No padding is required, if
C<PinBlockLengthPosition> is set to C<NONE>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryAccountNumber => Str

The Primary Account Number (PAN) of the cardholder.
