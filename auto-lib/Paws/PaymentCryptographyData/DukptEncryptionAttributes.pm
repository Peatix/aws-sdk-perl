=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptEncryptionAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptEncryptionAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DukptKeyDerivationType => $value, ..., Mode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptEncryptionAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DukptKeyDerivationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters that are required to encrypt plaintext data using DUKPT.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DukptKeyDerivationType => Str

The key type encrypted using DUKPT from a Base Derivation Key (BDK) and
Key Serial Number (KSN). This must be less than or equal to the
strength of the BDK. For example, you can't use C<AES_128> as a
derivation type for a BDK of C<AES_128> or C<TDES_2KEY>


=head2 DukptKeyVariant => Str

The type of use of DUKPT, which can be incoming data decryption,
outgoing data encryption, or both.


=head2 InitializationVector => Str

An input used to provide the intial state. If no value is provided,
Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography defaults it to zero.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeySerialNumber => Str

The unique identifier known as Key Serial Number (KSN) that comes from
an encrypting device using DUKPT encryption method. The KSN is derived
from the encrypting device unique identifier and an internal
transaction counter.


=head2 Mode => Str

The block cipher method to use for encryption.

The default is CBC.
