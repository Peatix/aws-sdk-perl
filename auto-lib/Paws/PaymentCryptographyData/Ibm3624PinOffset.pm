=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::Ibm3624PinOffset

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::Ibm3624PinOffset object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DecimalizationTable => $value, ..., PinValidationDataPadCharacter => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::Ibm3624PinOffset object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DecimalizationTable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Pparameters that are required to generate or verify Ibm3624 PIN offset
PIN.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DecimalizationTable => Str

The decimalization table to use for IBM 3624 PIN algorithm. The table
is used to convert the algorithm intermediate result from hexadecimal
characters to decimal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncryptedPinBlock => Str

The encrypted PIN block data. According to ISO 9564 standard, a PIN
Block is an encoded representation of a payment card Personal Account
Number (PAN) and the cardholder Personal Identification Number (PIN).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PinValidationData => Str

The unique data for cardholder identification.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PinValidationDataPadCharacter => Str

The padding character for validation data.
