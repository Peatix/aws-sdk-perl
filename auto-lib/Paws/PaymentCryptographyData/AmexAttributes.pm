=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::AmexAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::AmexAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplicationTransactionCounter => $value, ..., PrimaryAccountNumber => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::AmexAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplicationTransactionCounter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters to derive the confidentiality and integrity keys for a
payment card using Amex derivation method.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationTransactionCounter => Str

The transaction counter of the current transaction that is provided by
the terminal during transaction processing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AuthorizationRequestKeyIdentifier => Str

The C<keyArn> of the issuer master key for cryptogram (IMK-AC) for the
payment card.


=head2 CurrentPinAttributes => L<Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::CurrentPinAttributes>

The encrypted pinblock of the old pin stored on the chip card.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MajorKeyDerivationMode => Str

The method to use when deriving the master key for a payment card using
Amex derivation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PanSequenceNumber => Str

A number that identifies and differentiates payment cards with the same
Primary Account Number (PAN). Typically 00 is used, if no value is
provided by the terminal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryAccountNumber => Str

The Primary Account Number (PAN) of the cardholder.
