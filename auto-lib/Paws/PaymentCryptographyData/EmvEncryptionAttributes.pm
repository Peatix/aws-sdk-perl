=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvEncryptionAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvEncryptionAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InitializationVector => $value, ..., SessionDerivationData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::EmvEncryptionAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InitializationVector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters for plaintext encryption using EMV keys.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InitializationVector => Str

An input used to provide the intial state. If no value is provided,
Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography defaults it to zero.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MajorKeyDerivationMode => Str

The EMV derivation mode to use for ICC master key derivation as per EMV
version 4.3 book 2.


=head2 Mode => Str

The block cipher method to use for encryption.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PanSequenceNumber => Str

A number that identifies and differentiates payment cards with the same
Primary Account Number (PAN). Typically 00 is used, if no value is
provided by the terminal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryAccountNumber => Str

The Primary Account Number (PAN), a unique identifier for a payment
credit or debit card and associates the card to a specific account
holder.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SessionDerivationData => Str

The derivation value used to derive the ICC session key. It is
typically the application transaction counter value padded with zeros
or previous ARQC value padded with zeros as per EMV version 4.3 book 2.
