=head1 NAME

Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptDerivationAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptDerivationAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DukptKeyDerivationType => $value, ..., KeySerialNumber => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PaymentCryptographyData::DukptDerivationAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DukptKeyDerivationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parameters required for encryption or decryption of data using DUKPT.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DukptKeyDerivationType => Str

The key type derived using DUKPT from a Base Derivation Key (BDK) and
Key Serial Number (KSN). This must be less than or equal to the
strength of the BDK. For example, you can't use C<AES_128> as a
derivation type for a BDK of C<AES_128> or C<TDES_2KEY>


=head2 DukptKeyVariant => Str

The type of use of DUKPT, which can be for incoming data decryption,
outgoing data encryption, or both.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeySerialNumber => Str

The unique identifier known as Key Serial Number (KSN) that comes from
an encrypting device using DUKPT encryption method. The KSN is derived
from the encrypting device unique identifier and an internal
transaction counter.
