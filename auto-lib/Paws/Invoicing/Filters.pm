=head1 NAME

Paws::Invoicing::Filters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Invoicing::Filters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Accounts => $value, ..., Names => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Invoicing::Filters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Accounts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An optional input to the list API. If multiple filters are specified,

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside
filters to return invoice units that match only the specified accounts.
If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an C<OR> condition
(match any) of the specified accounts. The specified account IDs are
matched with either the receiver or the linked accounts in the rules.


=head2 InvoiceReceivers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

You can specify a list of Amazon Web Services account IDs inside
filters to return invoice units that match only the specified accounts.
If multiple accounts are provided, the result is an C<OR> condition
(match any) of the specified accounts. This filter only matches the
specified accounts on the invoice receivers of the invoice units.


=head2 Names => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An optional input to the list API. You can specify a list of invoice
unit names inside filters to return invoice units that match only the
specified invoice unit names. If multiple names are provided, the
result is an C<OR> condition (match any) of the specified invoice unit
names.
