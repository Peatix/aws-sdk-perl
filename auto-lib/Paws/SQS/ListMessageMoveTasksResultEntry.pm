=head1 NAME

Paws::SQS::ListMessageMoveTasksResultEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SQS::ListMessageMoveTasksResultEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApproximateNumberOfMessagesMoved => $value, ..., TaskHandle => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SQS::ListMessageMoveTasksResultEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApproximateNumberOfMessagesMoved

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details of a message movement task.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApproximateNumberOfMessagesMoved => Int

The approximate number of messages already moved to the destination
queue.


=head2 ApproximateNumberOfMessagesToMove => Int

The number of messages to be moved from the source queue. This number
is obtained at the time of starting the message movement task and is
only included after the message movement task is selected to start.


=head2 DestinationArn => Str

The ARN of the destination queue if it has been specified in the
C<StartMessageMoveTask> request. If a C<DestinationArn> has not been
specified in the C<StartMessageMoveTask> request, this field value will
be NULL.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

The task failure reason (only included if the task status is FAILED).


=head2 MaxNumberOfMessagesPerSecond => Int

The number of messages to be moved per second (the message movement
rate), if it has been specified in the C<StartMessageMoveTask> request.
If a C<MaxNumberOfMessagesPerSecond> has not been specified in the
C<StartMessageMoveTask> request, this field value will be NULL.


=head2 SourceArn => Str

The ARN of the queue that contains the messages to be moved to another
queue.


=head2 StartedTimestamp => Int

The timestamp of starting the message movement task.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the message movement task. Possible values are: RUNNING,
COMPLETED, CANCELLING, CANCELLED, and FAILED.


=head2 TaskHandle => Str

An identifier associated with a message movement task. When this field
is returned in the response of the C<ListMessageMoveTasks> action, it
is only populated for tasks that are in RUNNING status.
