Paws::EFS::DescribeBackupPolicy - Arguments for method DescribeBackupPolicy on L<Paws::EFS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeBackupPolicy on the
L<Amazon Elastic File System|Paws::EFS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeBackupPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeBackupPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $elasticfilesystem = Paws->service('EFS');
    my $BackupPolicyDescription = $elasticfilesystem->DescribeBackupPolicy(
      FileSystemId => 'MyFileSystemId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $BackupPolicy = $BackupPolicyDescription->BackupPolicy;

    # Returns a L<Paws::EFS::BackupPolicyDescription> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
