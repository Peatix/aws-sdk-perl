=head1 NAME

Paws::EFS::DestinationToCreate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EFS::DestinationToCreate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZoneName => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EFS::DestinationToCreate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZoneName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the new or existing destination file system for the
replication configuration.

=over

=item *

If you want to replicate to a new file system, do not specify the File
System ID for the destination file system. Amazon EFS creates a new,
empty file system. For One Zone storage, specify the Availability Zone
to create the file system in. To use an Key Management Service key
other than the default KMS key, then specify it. For more information,
see Configuring replication to new Amazon EFS file system
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/create-replication.html) in
the I<Amazon EFS User Guide>.

After the file system is created, you cannot change the KMS key or the
performance mode.

=item *

If you want to replicate to an existing file system that's in the same
account as the source file system, then you need to provide the ID or
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file system to which to replicate.
The file system's replication overwrite protection must be disabled.
For more information, see Replicating to an existing file system
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-replication#replicate-existing-destination)
in the I<Amazon EFS User Guide>.

=item *

If you are replicating the file system to a file system that's in a
different account than the source file system (cross-account
replication), you need to provide the ARN for the file system and the
IAM role that allows Amazon EFS to perform replication on the
destination account. The file system's replication overwrite protection
must be disabled. For more information, see Replicating across Amazon
Web Services accounts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/cross-account-replication.html)
in the I<Amazon EFS User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZoneName => Str

To create a file system that uses One Zone storage, specify the name of
the Availability Zone in which to create the destination file system.


=head2 FileSystemId => Str

The ID or ARN of the file system to use for the destination. For
cross-account replication, this must be an ARN. The file system's
replication overwrite replication must be disabled. If no ID or ARN is
specified, then a new file system is created.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

Specify the Key Management Service (KMS) key that you want to use to
encrypt the destination file system. If you do not specify a KMS key,
Amazon EFS uses your default KMS key for Amazon EFS,
C</aws/elasticfilesystem>. This ID can be in one of the following
formats:

=over

=item *

Key ID - The unique identifier of the key, for example
C<1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.

=item *

ARN - The ARN for the key, for example
C<arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.

=item *

Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for example
C<alias/projectKey1>.

=item *

Key alias ARN - The ARN for a key alias, for example
C<arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1>.

=back



=head2 Region => Str

To create a file system that uses Regional storage, specify the Amazon
Web Services Region in which to create the destination file system. The
Region must be enabled for the Amazon Web Services account that owns
the source file system. For more information, see Managing Amazon Web
Services Regions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html#rande-manage-enable)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference Reference Guide>.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role in the source account that
allows Amazon EFS to perform replication on its behalf. This is
optional for same-account replication and required for cross-account
replication.
