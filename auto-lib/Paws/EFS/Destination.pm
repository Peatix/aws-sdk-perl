=head1 NAME

Paws::EFS::Destination

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EFS::Destination object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FileSystemId => $value, ..., StatusMessage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EFS::Destination object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FileSystemId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the destination file system in the replication configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FileSystemId => Str

The ID of the destination Amazon EFS file system.


=head2 LastReplicatedTimestamp => Str

The time when the most recent sync was successfully completed on the
destination file system. Any changes to data on the source file system
that occurred before this time have been successfully replicated to the
destination file system. Any changes that occurred after this time
might not be fully replicated.


=head2 OwnerId => Str

ID of the Amazon Web Services account in which the destination file
system resides.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Region => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region in which the destination file system is
located.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role in the source account that
allows Amazon EFS to perform replication on its behalf. This is
optional for same-account replication and required for cross-account
replication.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Describes the status of the replication configuration. For more
information about replication status, see Viewing replication details
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/awsbackup.html#restoring-backup-efsmonitoring-replication-status.html)
in the I<Amazon EFS User Guide>.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

Message that provides details about the C<PAUSED> or C<ERRROR> state of
the replication destination configuration. For more information about
replication status messages, see Viewing replication details
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/awsbackup.html#restoring-backup-efsmonitoring-replication-status.html)
in the I<Amazon EFS User Guide>.
