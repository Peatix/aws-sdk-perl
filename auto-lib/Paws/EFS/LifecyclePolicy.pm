=head1 NAME

Paws::EFS::LifecyclePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EFS::LifecyclePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TransitionToArchive => $value, ..., TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EFS::LifecyclePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TransitionToArchive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a policy used by lifecycle management that specifies when to
transition files into and out of storage classes. For more information,
see Managing file system storage
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html).

When using the C<put-lifecycle-configuration> CLI command or the
C<PutLifecycleConfiguration> API action, Amazon EFS requires that each
C<LifecyclePolicy> object have only a single transition. This means
that in a request body, C<LifecyclePolicies> must be structured as an
array of C<LifecyclePolicy> objects, one object for each transition.
For more information, see the request examples in
PutLifecycleConfiguration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TransitionToArchive => Str

The number of days after files were last accessed in primary storage
(the Standard storage class) at which to move them to Archive storage.
Metadata operations such as listing the contents of a directory don't
count as file access events.


=head2 TransitionToIA => Str

The number of days after files were last accessed in primary storage
(the Standard storage class) at which to move them to Infrequent Access
(IA) storage. Metadata operations such as listing the contents of a
directory don't count as file access events.


=head2 TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass => Str

Whether to move files back to primary (Standard) storage after they are
accessed in IA or Archive storage. Metadata operations such as listing
the contents of a directory don't count as file access events.
