=head1 NAME

Paws::Neptune::ClusterPendingModifiedValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Neptune::ClusterPendingModifiedValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., StorageType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Neptune::ClusterPendingModifiedValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is used as a response element in the C<ModifyDBCluster>
operation and contains changes that will be applied during the next
maintenance window.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for database engines. For
Neptune, C<AllocatedStorage> always returns 1, because Neptune DB
cluster storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as
needed.


=head2 BackupRetentionPeriod => Int

The number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.


=head2 DBClusterIdentifier => Str

The DBClusterIdentifier value for the DB cluster.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The database engine version.


=head2 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled => Bool

A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity
and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.


=head2 Iops => Int

The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value. This setting is
only for Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 PendingCloudwatchLogsExports => L<Paws::Neptune::PendingCloudwatchLogsExports>

This C<PendingCloudwatchLogsExports> structure specifies pending
changes to which CloudWatch logs are enabled and which are disabled.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The pending change in storage type for the DB cluster. Valid Values:

=over

=item *

B<C<standard> > E<ndash> ( I<the default> ) Configures cost-effective
database storage for applications with moderate to small I/O usage.

=item *

B<C<iopt1> > E<ndash> Enables I/O-Optimized storage
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/storage-types.html#provisioned-iops-storage)
that's designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive graph workloads that
require predictable pricing with low I/O latency and consistent I/O
throughput.

Neptune I/O-Optimized storage is only available starting with engine
release 1.3.0.0.
