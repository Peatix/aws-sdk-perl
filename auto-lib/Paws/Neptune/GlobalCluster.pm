=head1 NAME

Paws::Neptune::GlobalCluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Neptune::GlobalCluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeletionProtection => $value, ..., StorageEncrypted => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Neptune::GlobalCluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeletionProtection

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details of an Amazon Neptune global database.

This data type is used as a response element for the
CreateGlobalCluster, DescribeGlobalClusters, ModifyGlobalCluster,
DeleteGlobalCluster, FailoverGlobalCluster, and RemoveFromGlobalCluster
actions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeletionProtection => Bool

The deletion protection setting for the global database.


=head2 Engine => Str

The Neptune database engine used by the global database (C<"neptune">).


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The Neptune engine version used by the global database.


=head2 FailoverState => L<Paws::Neptune::FailoverState>

A data object containing all properties for the current state of an
in-process or pending switchover or failover process for this global
cluster (Neptune global database). This object is empty unless the
C<SwitchoverGlobalCluster> or C<FailoverGlobalCluster> operation was
called on this global cluster.


=head2 GlobalClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global database.


=head2 GlobalClusterIdentifier => Str

Contains a user-supplied global database cluster identifier. This
identifier is the unique key that identifies a global database.


=head2 GlobalClusterMembers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Neptune::GlobalClusterMember>]

A list of cluster ARNs and instance ARNs for all the DB clusters that
are part of the global database.


=head2 GlobalClusterResourceId => Str

An immutable identifier for the global database that is unique within
in all regions. This identifier is found in CloudTrail log entries
whenever the KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.


=head2 Status => Str

Specifies the current state of this global database.


=head2 StorageEncrypted => Bool

The storage encryption setting for the global database.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Neptune>
