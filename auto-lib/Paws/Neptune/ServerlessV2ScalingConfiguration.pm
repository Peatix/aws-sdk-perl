=head1 NAME

Paws::Neptune::ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Neptune::ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacity => $value, ..., MinCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Neptune::ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the scaling configuration of a Neptune Serverless DB cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Num

The maximum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB instance
in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU values in
half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on.


=head2 MinCapacity => Num

The minimum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB instance
in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU values in
half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on.
