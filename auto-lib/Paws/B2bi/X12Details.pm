=head1 NAME

Paws::B2bi::X12Details

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::B2bi::X12Details object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TransactionSet => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::B2bi::X12Details object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TransactionSet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the X12 transaction set and version. The X12
structure is used when the system transforms an EDI (electronic data
interchange) file.

If an EDI input file contains more than one transaction, each
transaction must have the same transaction set and version, for example
214/4010. If not, the transformer cannot parse the file.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TransactionSet => Str

Returns an enumerated type where each value identifies an X12
transaction set. Transaction sets are maintained by the X12 Accredited
Standards Committee.


=head2 Version => Str

Returns the version to use for the specified X12 transaction set.
