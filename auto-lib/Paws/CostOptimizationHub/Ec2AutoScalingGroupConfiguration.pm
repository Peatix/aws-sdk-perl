=head1 NAME

Paws::CostOptimizationHub::Ec2AutoScalingGroupConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostOptimizationHub::Ec2AutoScalingGroupConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostOptimizationHub::Ec2AutoScalingGroupConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The EC2 Auto Scaling group configuration used for recommendations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

The strategy used for allocating instances, based on a predefined
priority order or based on the lowest available price.


=head2 Instance => L<Paws::CostOptimizationHub::InstanceConfiguration>

Details about the instance for the EC2 Auto Scaling group with a single
instance type.


=head2 MixedInstances => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CostOptimizationHub::MixedInstanceConfiguration>]

A list of instance types for an EC2 Auto Scaling group with mixed
instance types.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of EC2 Auto Scaling group, showing whether it consists of a
single instance type or mixed instance types.
