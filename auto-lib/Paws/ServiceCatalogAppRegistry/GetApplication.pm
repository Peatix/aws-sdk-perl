    my $GetApplicationResponse = $servicecatalog -appregistry->GetApplication(
      Application => 'MyApplicationSpecifier',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationTag = $GetApplicationResponse->ApplicationTag;
    my $Arn            = $GetApplicationResponse->Arn;
    my $AssociatedResourceCount =
      $GetApplicationResponse->AssociatedResourceCount;
