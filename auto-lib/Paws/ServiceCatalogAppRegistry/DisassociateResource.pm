=head1 NAME

Paws::ServiceCatalogAppRegistry::DisassociateResource - Arguments for method DisassociateResource on L<Paws::ServiceCatalogAppRegistry>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateResource on the
L<AWS Service Catalog App Registry|Paws::ServiceCatalogAppRegistry> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $servicecatalog-appregistry = Paws->service('ServiceCatalogAppRegistry');
    my $DisassociateResourceResponse =
      $servicecatalog -appregistry->DisassociateResource(
      Application  => 'MyApplicationSpecifier',
      Resource     => 'MyResourceSpecifier',
      ResourceType => 'CFN_STACK',

      );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationArn = $DisassociateResourceResponse->ApplicationArn;
    my $ResourceArn    = $DisassociateResourceResponse->ResourceArn;

# Returns a L<Paws::ServiceCatalogAppRegistry::DisassociateResourceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
