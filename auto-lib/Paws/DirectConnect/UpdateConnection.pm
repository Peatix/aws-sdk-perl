=head1 NAME

Paws::DirectConnect::UpdateConnection - Arguments for method UpdateConnection on L<Paws::DirectConnect>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateConnection on the
L<AWS Direct Connect|Paws::DirectConnect> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateConnection.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateConnection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $directconnect = Paws->service('DirectConnect');
    my $Connection = $directconnect->UpdateConnection(
      ConnectionId   => 'MyConnectionId',
      ConnectionName => 'MyConnectionName',    # OPTIONAL
      EncryptionMode => 'MyEncryptionMode',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AwsDevice            = $Connection->AwsDevice;
    my $AwsDeviceV2          = $Connection->AwsDeviceV2;
    my $AwsLogicalDeviceId   = $Connection->AwsLogicalDeviceId;
    my $Bandwidth            = $Connection->Bandwidth;
    my $ConnectionId         = $Connection->ConnectionId;
    my $ConnectionName       = $Connection->ConnectionName;
    my $ConnectionState      = $Connection->ConnectionState;
    my $EncryptionMode       = $Connection->EncryptionMode;
    my $HasLogicalRedundancy = $Connection->HasLogicalRedundancy;
    my $JumboFrameCapable    = $Connection->JumboFrameCapable;
    my $LagId                = $Connection->LagId;
    my $LoaIssueTime         = $Connection->LoaIssueTime;
    my $Location             = $Connection->Location;
    my $MacSecCapable        = $Connection->MacSecCapable;
    my $MacSecKeys           = $Connection->MacSecKeys;
    my $OwnerAccount         = $Connection->OwnerAccount;
    my $PartnerName          = $Connection->PartnerName;
    my $PortEncryptionStatus = $Connection->PortEncryptionStatus;
    my $ProviderName         = $Connection->ProviderName;
    my $Region               = $Connection->Region;
    my $Tags                 = $Connection->Tags;
    my $Vlan                 = $Connection->Vlan;

    # Returns a L<Paws::DirectConnect::Connection> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/directconnect/UpdateConnection>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConnectionId => Str

The ID of the dedicated connection.

You can use DescribeConnections to retrieve the connection ID.
