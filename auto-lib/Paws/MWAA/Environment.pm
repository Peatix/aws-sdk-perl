=head1 NAME

Paws::MWAA::Environment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MWAA::Environment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AirflowConfigurationOptions => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceWindowStart => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MWAA::Environment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AirflowConfigurationOptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)
environment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AirflowConfigurationOptions => L<Paws::MWAA::AirflowConfigurationOptions>

A list of key-value pairs containing the Apache Airflow configuration
options attached to your environment. For more information, see Apache
Airflow configuration options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/configuring-env-variables.html).


=head2 AirflowVersion => Str

The Apache Airflow version on your environment.

Valid values: C<1.10.12>, C<2.0.2>, C<2.2.2>, C<2.4.3>, C<2.5.1>,
C<2.6.3>, C<2.7.2>, C<2.8.1>, C<2.9.2>, C<2.10.1>, and C<2.10.3>.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon MWAA environment.


=head2 CeleryExecutorQueue => Str

The queue ARN for the environment's Celery Executor
(https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/executor/celery.html).
Amazon MWAA uses a Celery Executor to distribute tasks across multiple
workers. When you create an environment in a shared VPC, you must
provide access to the Celery Executor queue from your VPC.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The day and time the environment was created.


=head2 DagS3Path => Str

The relative path to the DAGs folder in your Amazon S3 bucket. For
example, C<s3://mwaa-environment/dags>. For more information, see
Adding or updating DAGs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/configuring-dag-folder.html).


=head2 DatabaseVpcEndpointService => Str

The VPC endpoint for the environment's Amazon RDS database.


=head2 EndpointManagement => Str

Defines whether the VPC endpoints configured for the environment are
created, and managed, by the customer or by Amazon MWAA. If set to
C<SERVICE>, Amazon MWAA will create and manage the required VPC
endpoints in your VPC. If set to C<CUSTOMER>, you must create, and
manage, the VPC endpoints in your VPC.


=head2 EnvironmentClass => Str

The environment class type. Valid values: C<mw1.micro>, C<mw1.small>,
C<mw1.medium>, C<mw1.large>, C<mw1.xlarge>, and C<mw1.2xlarge>. For
more information, see Amazon MWAA environment class
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/environment-class.html).


=head2 ExecutionRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role in IAM that allows
MWAA to access Amazon Web Services resources in your environment. For
example, C<arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/my-execution-role>. For more
information, see Amazon MWAA Execution role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/mwaa-create-role.html).


=head2 KmsKey => Str

The KMS encryption key used to encrypt the data in your environment.


=head2 LastUpdate => L<Paws::MWAA::LastUpdate>

The status of the last update on the environment.


=head2 LoggingConfiguration => L<Paws::MWAA::LoggingConfiguration>

The Apache Airflow logs published to CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 MaxWebservers => Int

The maximum number of web servers that you want to run in your
environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web
servers up to the number you specify for C<MaxWebservers> when you
interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST
API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. For example, in scenarios where your
workload requires network calls to the Apache Airflow REST API with a
high transaction-per-second (TPS) rate, Amazon MWAA will increase the
number of web servers up to the number set in C<MaxWebserers>. As TPS
rates decrease Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web servers, and
scales down to the number set in C<MinxWebserers>.

Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values
from C<2> to C<5>. Defaults to C<2> for all environment sizes except
mw1.micro, which defaults to C<1>.


=head2 MaxWorkers => Int

The maximum number of workers that run in your environment. For
example, C<20>.


=head2 MinWebservers => Int

The minimum number of web servers that you want to run in your
environment. Amazon MWAA scales the number of Apache Airflow web
servers up to the number you specify for C<MaxWebservers> when you
interact with your Apache Airflow environment using Apache Airflow REST
API, or the Apache Airflow CLI. As the transaction-per-second rate, and
the network load, decrease, Amazon MWAA disposes of the additional web
servers, and scales down to the number set in C<MinxWebserers>.

Valid values: For environments larger than mw1.micro, accepts values
from C<2> to C<5>. Defaults to C<2> for all environment sizes except
mw1.micro, which defaults to C<1>.


=head2 MinWorkers => Int

The minimum number of workers that run in your environment. For
example, C<2>.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the Amazon MWAA environment. For example,
C<MyMWAAEnvironment>.


=head2 NetworkConfiguration => L<Paws::MWAA::NetworkConfiguration>

Describes the VPC networking components used to secure and enable
network traffic between the Amazon Web Services resources for your
environment. For more information, see About networking on Amazon MWAA
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/latest/userguide/networking-about.html).

Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8 encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that
are no more than 1,024 bytes long. The following is an example:

=head2 Status => Str

The status of the Amazon MWAA environment.

Valid values:

=over

=item *

C<CREATING> - Indicates the request to create the environment is in
progress.

=item *

C<CREATING_SNAPSHOT> - Indicates the request to update environment
details, or upgrade the environment version, is in progress and Amazon
MWAA is creating a storage volume snapshot of the Amazon RDS database
cluster associated with the environment. A database snapshot is a
backup created at a specific point in time. Amazon MWAA uses snapshots
to recover environment metadata if the process to update or upgrade an
environment fails.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED> - Indicates the request to create the environment
failed, and the environment could not be created.

=item *

C<AVAILABLE> - Indicates the request was successful and the environment
is ready to use.

=item *

C<PENDING> - Indicates the request was successful, but the process to
create the environment is paused until you create the required VPC
endpoints in your VPC. After you create the VPC endpoints, the process
resumes.

=item *

C<UPDATING> - Indicates the request to update the environment is in
progress.

=item *

C<ROLLING_BACK> - Indicates the request to update environment details,
or upgrade the environment version, failed and Amazon MWAA is restoring
the environment using the latest storage volume snapshot.

=item *

C<DELETING> - Indicates the request to delete the environment is in
progress.

=item *

C<DELETED> - Indicates the request to delete the environment is
complete, and the environment has been deleted.

=item *

C<UNAVAILABLE> - Indicates the request failed, but the environment did
not return to its previous state and is not stable.

=item *

C<UPDATE_FAILED> - Indicates the request to update the environment
failed, and the environment was restored to its previous state
successfully and is ready to use.

=item *

C<MAINTENANCE> - Indicates that the environment is undergoing
maintenance. Depending on the type of work Amazon MWAA is performing,
your environment might become unavailable during this process. After
all operations are done, your environment will return to its status
prior to mainteneace operations.
