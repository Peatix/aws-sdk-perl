=head1 NAME

Paws::Kafka::ConsumerGroupReplication

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kafka::ConsumerGroupReplication object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConsumerGroupsToExclude => $value, ..., SynchroniseConsumerGroupOffsets => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kafka::ConsumerGroupReplication object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConsumerGroupsToExclude

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about consumer group replication.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConsumerGroupsToExclude => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

List of regular expression patterns indicating the consumer groups that
should not be replicated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConsumerGroupsToReplicate => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

List of regular expression patterns indicating the consumer groups to
copy.


=head2 DetectAndCopyNewConsumerGroups => Bool

Enables synchronization of consumer groups to target cluster.


=head2 SynchroniseConsumerGroupOffsets => Bool

Enables synchronization of consumer group offsets to target cluster.
The translated offsets will be written to topic __consumer_offsets.
