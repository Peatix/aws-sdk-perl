=head1 NAME

Paws::EMRServerless::JobRun

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMRServerless::JobRun object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplicationId => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMRServerless::JobRun object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplicationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a job run. A job run is a unit of work, such as a
Spark JAR, Hive query, or SparkSQL query, that you submit to an Amazon
EMR Serverless application.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationId => Str

The ID of the application the job is running on.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The execution role ARN of the job run.


=head2 Attempt => Int

The attempt of the job run.


=head2 AttemptCreatedAt => Str

The date and time of when the job run attempt was created.


=head2 AttemptUpdatedAt => Str

The date and time of when the job run attempt was last updated.


=head2 BilledResourceUtilization => L<Paws::EMRServerless::ResourceUtilization>

The aggregate vCPU, memory, and storage that Amazon Web Services has
billed for the job run. The billed resources include a 1-minute minimum
usage for workers, plus additional storage over 20 GB per worker. Note
that billed resources do not include usage for idle pre-initialized
workers.


=head2 ConfigurationOverrides => L<Paws::EMRServerless::ConfigurationOverrides>

The configuration settings that are used to override default
configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The date and time when the job run was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedBy => Str

The user who created the job run.


=head2 EndedAt => Str

The date and time when the job was terminated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExecutionRole => Str

The execution role ARN of the job run.


=head2 ExecutionTimeoutMinutes => Int

Returns the job run timeout value from the C<StartJobRun> call. If no
timeout was specified, then it returns the default timeout of 720
minutes.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobDriver => L<Paws::EMRServerless::JobDriver>

The job driver for the job run.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobRunId => Str

The ID of the job run.


=head2 Mode => Str

The mode of the job run.


=head2 Name => Str

The optional job run name. This doesn't have to be unique.


=head2 NetworkConfiguration => L<Paws::EMRServerless::NetworkConfiguration>




=head2 QueuedDurationMilliseconds => Int

The total time for a job in the QUEUED state in milliseconds.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReleaseLabel => Str

The Amazon EMR release associated with the application your job is
running on.


=head2 RetryPolicy => L<Paws::EMRServerless::RetryPolicy>

The retry policy of the job run.


=head2 StartedAt => Str

The date and time when the job moved to the RUNNING state.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> State => Str

The state of the job run.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StateDetails => Str

The state details of the job run.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::EMRServerless::TagMap>

The tags assigned to the job run.


=head2 TotalExecutionDurationSeconds => Int

The job run total execution duration in seconds. This field is only
available for job runs in a C<COMPLETED>, C<FAILED>, or C<CANCELLED>
state.


=head2 TotalResourceUtilization => L<Paws::EMRServerless::TotalResourceUtilization>

The aggregate vCPU, memory, and storage resources used from the time
the job starts to execute, until the time the job terminates, rounded
up to the nearest second.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdatedAt => Str

The date and time when the job run was updated.
