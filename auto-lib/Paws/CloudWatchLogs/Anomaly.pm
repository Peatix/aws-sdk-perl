=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::Anomaly

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::Anomaly object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Active => $value, ..., SuppressedUntil => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::Anomaly object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Active

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure represents one anomaly that has been found by a logs
anomaly detector.

For more information about patterns and anomalies, see
CreateLogAnomalyDetector
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLogAnomalyDetector.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Active => Bool

Specifies whether this anomaly is still ongoing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AnomalyDetectorArn => Str

The ARN of the anomaly detector that identified this anomaly.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AnomalyId => Str

The unique ID that CloudWatch Logs assigned to this anomaly.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A human-readable description of the anomaly. This description is
generated by CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirstSeen => Int

The date and time when the anomaly detector first saw this anomaly. It
is specified as epoch time, which is the number of seconds since
C<January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Histogram => L<Paws::CloudWatchLogs::Histogram>

A map showing times when the anomaly detector ran, and the number of
occurrences of this anomaly that were detected at each of those runs.
The times are specified in epoch time, which is the number of seconds
since C<January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC>.


=head2 IsPatternLevelSuppression => Bool

If this anomaly is suppressed, this field is C<true> if the suppression
is because the pattern is suppressed. If C<false>, then only this
particular anomaly is suppressed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastSeen => Int

The date and time when the anomaly detector most recently saw this
anomaly. It is specified as epoch time, which is the number of seconds
since C<January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogGroupArnList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of ARNS of the log groups that contained log events considered
to be part of this anomaly.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogSamples => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatchLogs::LogEvent>]

An array of sample log event messages that are considered to be part of
this anomaly.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PatternId => Str

The ID of the pattern used to help identify this anomaly.


=head2 PatternRegex => Str

The pattern used to help identify this anomaly, in regular expression
format.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PatternString => Str

The pattern used to help identify this anomaly, in string format.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PatternTokens => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatchLogs::PatternToken>]

An array of structures where each structure contains information about
one token that makes up the pattern.


=head2 Priority => Str

The priority level of this anomaly, as determined by CloudWatch Logs.
Priority is computed based on log severity labels such as C<FATAL> and
C<ERROR> and the amount of deviation from the baseline. Possible values
are C<HIGH>, C<MEDIUM>, and C<LOW>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> State => Str

Indicates the current state of this anomaly. If it is still being
treated as an anomaly, the value is C<Active>. If you have suppressed
this anomaly by using the UpdateAnomaly
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAnomaly.html)
operation, the value is C<Suppressed>. If this behavior is now
considered to be normal, the value is C<Baseline>.


=head2 Suppressed => Bool

Indicates whether this anomaly is currently suppressed. To suppress an
anomaly, use UpdateAnomaly
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAnomaly.html).


=head2 SuppressedDate => Int

If the anomaly is suppressed, this indicates when it was suppressed.


=head2 SuppressedUntil => Int

If the anomaly is suppressed, this indicates when the suppression will
end. If this value is C<0>, the anomaly was suppressed with no
expiration, with the C<INFINITE> value.
