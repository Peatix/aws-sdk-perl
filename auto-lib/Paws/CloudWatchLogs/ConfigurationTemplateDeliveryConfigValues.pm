=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ConfigurationTemplateDeliveryConfigValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ConfigurationTemplateDeliveryConfigValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldDelimiter => $value, ..., S3DeliveryConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ConfigurationTemplateDeliveryConfigValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldDelimiter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the default values that are used for each
configuration parameter when you use CreateDelivery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html)
to create a deliver under the current service type, resource type, and
log type.

The default field delimiter that is used in a CreateDelivery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html)

The field delimiter is used only when the final output delivery is in
C<Plain>, C<W3C>, or C<Raw> format.


=head2 RecordFields => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The default record fields that will be delivered when a list of record
fields is not provided in a CreateDelivery

operation.

The delivery parameters that are used when you create a delivery to a
delivery destination that is an S3 Bucket.
