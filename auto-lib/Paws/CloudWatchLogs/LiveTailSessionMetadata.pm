=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::LiveTailSessionMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::LiveTailSessionMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Sampled => $value, ..., Sampled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::LiveTailSessionMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Sampled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object contains the metadata for one C<LiveTailSessionUpdate>
structure. It indicates whether that update includes only a sample of
500 log events out of a larger number of ingested log events, or if it
contains all of the matching log events ingested during that second of
time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Sampled => Bool

If this is C<true>, then more than 500 log events matched the request
for this update, and the C<sessionResults> includes a sample of 500 of
those events.

If this is C<false>, then 500 or fewer log events matched the request
for this update, so no sampling was necessary. In this case, the
C<sessionResults> array includes all log events that matched your
request during this time.
