=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::AnomalyDetector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::AnomalyDetector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnomalyDetectorArn => $value, ..., LogGroupArnList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::AnomalyDetector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnomalyDetectorArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about one anomaly detector in the account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnomalyDetectorArn => Str

The ARN of the anomaly detector.


=head2 AnomalyDetectorStatus => Str

Specifies the current status of the anomaly detector. To pause an
anomaly detector, use the C<enabled> parameter in the
UpdateLogAnomalyDetector
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateLogAnomalyDetector.html)
operation.


=head2 AnomalyVisibilityTime => Int

The number of days used as the life cycle of anomalies. After this
time, anomalies are automatically baselined and the anomaly detector
model will treat new occurrences of similar event as normal.


=head2 CreationTimeStamp => Int

The date and time when this anomaly detector was created.


=head2 DetectorName => Str

The name of the anomaly detector.


=head2 EvaluationFrequency => Str

Specifies how often the anomaly detector runs and look for anomalies.


=head2 FilterPattern => Str




=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The ARN of the KMS key assigned to this anomaly detector, if any.


=head2 LastModifiedTimeStamp => Int

The date and time when this anomaly detector was most recently
modified.


=head2 LogGroupArnList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the ARNs of the log groups that this anomaly detector
watches.
