=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::QueryStatistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::QueryStatistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BytesScanned => $value, ..., RecordsScanned => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::QueryStatistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BytesScanned

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the number of log events scanned by the query, the number of
log events that matched the query criteria, and the total number of
bytes in the log events that were scanned.

If the query involved log groups that have field index policies, the
estimated number of skipped log events and the total bytes of those
skipped log events are included. Using field indexes to skip log events
in queries reduces scan volume and improves performance. For more
information, see Create field indexes to improve query performance and
reduce scan volume
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BytesScanned => Num

The total number of bytes in the log events scanned during the query.


=head2 EstimatedBytesSkipped => Num

An estimate of the number of bytes in the log events that were skipped
when processing this query, because the query contained an indexed
field. Skipping these entries lowers query costs and improves the query
performance time. For more information about field indexes, see
PutIndexPolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutIndexPolicy.html).


=head2 EstimatedRecordsSkipped => Num

An estimate of the number of log events that were skipped when
processing this query, because the query contained an indexed field.
Skipping these entries lowers query costs and improves the query
performance time. For more information about field indexes, see
PutIndexPolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutIndexPolicy.html).


=head2 LogGroupsScanned => Num

The number of log groups that were scanned by this query.


=head2 RecordsMatched => Num

The number of log events that matched the query string.


=head2 RecordsScanned => Num

The total number of log events scanned during the query.
