=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParseKeyValue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParseKeyValue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Source => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParseKeyValue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This processor parses a specified field in the original log event into
key-value pairs.

For more information about this processor including examples, see
parseKeyValue
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-parseKeyValue)
in the I<CloudWatch Logs User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => Str

The destination field to put the extracted key-value pairs into


=head2 FieldDelimiter => Str

The field delimiter string that is used between key-value pairs in the
original log events. If you omit this, the ampersand C<&> character is
used.


=head2 KeyPrefix => Str

If you want to add a prefix to all transformed keys, specify it here.


=head2 KeyValueDelimiter => Str

The delimiter string to use between the key and value in each pair in
the transformed log event.

If you omit this, the equal C<=> character is used.


=head2 NonMatchValue => Str

A value to insert into the value field in the result, when a key-value
pair is not successfully split.


=head2 OverwriteIfExists => Bool

Specifies whether to overwrite the value if the destination key already
exists. If you omit this, the default is C<false>.


=head2 Source => Str

Path to the field in the log event that will be parsed. Use dot
notation to access child fields. For example, C<store.book>
