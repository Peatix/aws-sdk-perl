=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatchLogs::DeliverySource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::DeliverySource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::DeliverySource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about one I<delivery source> in
your account. A delivery source is an Amazon Web Services resource that
sends logs to an Amazon Web Services destination. The destination can
be CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, or Firehose.

Only some Amazon Web Services services support being configured as a
delivery source. These services are listed as B<Supported [V2
Permissions]> in the table at Enabling logging from Amazon Web Services
services.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html)

To configure logs delivery between a supported Amazon Web Services
service and a destination, you must do the following:

=over

=item *

Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the
resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see
PutDeliverySource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html).

=item *

Create a I<delivery destination>, which is a logical object that
represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see
PutDeliveryDestination
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html).

=item *

If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use
PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html)
in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination.
This policy allows delivery to that destination.

=item *

Create a I<delivery> by pairing exactly one delivery source and one
delivery destination. For more information, see CreateDelivery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html).

=back

You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple
destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create
multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs
to the same delivery destination.
