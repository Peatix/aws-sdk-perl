Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParsePostgres

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParsePostgres object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Source => $value, ..., Source => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatchLogs::ParsePostgres object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Source

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this processor to parse RDS for PostgreSQL vended logs, extract
fields, and and convert them into a JSON format. This processor always
processes the entire log event message. For more information about this
processor including examples, see parsePostGres
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-parsePostGres).

For more information about RDS for PostgreSQL log format, see RDS for
PostgreSQL database log filesTCP flag sequence
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.html#USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.Log_Format.log-line-prefix).

If you use this processor, it must be the first processor in your
transformer.
