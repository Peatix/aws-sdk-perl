Determines whether the commitment period for a radio unit is set to
automatically renew for an additional 1 year after your current

renew. Set to C<False> if you do not want your commitment to
automatically renew.

You can do the following:

year. The hourly rate for the additional year will continue to be the
same as your existing 1-year rate.

=item *

Set a 3-year commitment to automatically renew for an additional 1
year. The hourly rate for the additional year will continue to be the
same as your existing 3-year rate.

=item *

Turn off a previously-enabled automatic renewal on a 1-year or 3-year
commitment.

choose a 60-day, 1-year, or 3-year period.
