=head1 NAME

Paws::Detective::MemberDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Detective::MemberDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., VolumeUsageUpdatedTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Detective::MemberDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about a member account in a behavior graph.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account identifier for the member account.


=head2 AdministratorId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administrator account
for the behavior graph.


=head2 DatasourcePackageIngestStates => L<Paws::Detective::DatasourcePackageIngestStates>

The state of a data source package for the behavior graph.


=head2 DisabledReason => Str

For member accounts with a status of C<ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED>, the
reason that the member account is not enabled.

The reason can have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<VOLUME_TOO_HIGH> - Indicates that adding the member account would
cause the data volume for the behavior graph to be too high.

=item *

C<VOLUME_UNKNOWN> - Indicates that Detective is unable to verify the
data volume for the member account. This is usually because the member
account is not enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty.

=back



=head2 EmailAddress => Str

The Amazon Web Services account root user email address for the member
account.


=head2 GraphArn => Str

The ARN of the behavior graph.


=head2 InvitationType => Str

The type of behavior graph membership.

For an organization account in the organization behavior graph, the
type is C<ORGANIZATION>.

For an account that was invited to a behavior graph, the type is
C<INVITATION>.


=head2 InvitedTime => Str

For invited accounts, the date and time that Detective sent the
invitation to the account. The value is an ISO8601 formatted string.
For example, C<2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z>.


=head2 MasterId => Str

The Amazon Web Services account identifier of the administrator account
for the behavior graph.


=head2 PercentOfGraphUtilization => Num

The member account data volume as a percentage of the maximum allowed
data volume. 0 indicates 0 percent, and 100 indicates 100 percent.

Note that this is not the percentage of the behavior graph data volume.

For example, the data volume for the behavior graph is 80 GB per day.
The maximum data volume is 160 GB per day. If the data volume for the
member account is 40 GB per day, then C<PercentOfGraphUtilization> is
25. It represents 25% of the maximum allowed data volume.


=head2 PercentOfGraphUtilizationUpdatedTime => Str

The date and time when the graph utilization percentage was last
updated. The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For example,
C<2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z>.


=head2 Status => Str

The current membership status of the member account. The status can
have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<INVITED> - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the member was
sent an invitation but has not yet responded.

=item *

C<VERIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS> - For invited accounts only, indicates that
Detective is verifying that the account identifier and email address
provided for the member account match. If they do match, then Detective
sends the invitation. If the email address and account identifier don't
match, then the member cannot be added to the behavior graph.

For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, indicates
that Detective is verifying that the account belongs to the
organization.

=item *

C<VERIFICATION_FAILED> - For invited accounts only. Indicates that the
account and email address provided for the member account do not match,
and Detective did not send an invitation to the account.

=item *

C<ENABLED> - Indicates that the member account currently contributes
data to the behavior graph. For invited accounts, the member account
accepted the invitation. For organization accounts in the organization
behavior graph, the Detective administrator account enabled the
organization account as a member account.

=item *

C<ACCEPTED_BUT_DISABLED> - The account accepted the invitation, or was
enabled by the Detective administrator account, but is prevented from
contributing data to the behavior graph. C<DisabledReason> provides the
reason why the member account is not enabled.

=back

Invited accounts that declined an invitation or that were removed from
the behavior graph are not included. In the organization behavior
graph, organization accounts that the Detective administrator account
did not enable are not included.


=head2 UpdatedTime => Str

The date and time that the member account was last updated. The value
is an ISO8601 formatted string. For example,
C<2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z>.


=head2 VolumeUsageByDatasourcePackage => L<Paws::Detective::VolumeUsageByDatasourcePackage>

Details on the volume of usage for each data source package in a
behavior graph.


=head2 VolumeUsageInBytes => Int

The data volume in bytes per day for the member account.


=head2 VolumeUsageUpdatedTime => Str

The data and time when the member account data volume was last updated.
The value is an ISO8601 formatted string. For example,
C<2021-08-18T16:35:56.284Z>.
