The state of a notification setting.

A notification setting includes information such as event name,
threshold, status of the notification setting, and the channel to
notify.

settings configured by IAM Roles Anywhere, the value is
C<rolesanywhere.amazonaws.com>, and for customized notifications
settings, it is the respective account ID.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Event => Str

The event to which this notification setting is applied.
