=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::KinesisVideoStreamStartSelector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::KinesisVideoStreamStartSelector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FragmentNumber => $value, ..., ProducerTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::KinesisVideoStreamStartSelector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FragmentNumber

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the starting point in a Kinesis stream to start processing.
You can use the producer timestamp or the fragment number. One of
either producer timestamp or fragment number is required. If you use
the producer timestamp, you must put the time in milliseconds. For more
information about fragment numbers, see Fragment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_reader_Fragment.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FragmentNumber => Str

The unique identifier of the fragment. This value monotonically
increases based on the ingestion order.


=head2 ProducerTimestamp => Int

The timestamp from the producer corresponding to the fragment, in
milliseconds, expressed in unix time format.
