=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::DatasetChanges

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::DatasetChanges object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GroundTruth => $value, ..., GroundTruth => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::DatasetChanges object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GroundTruth

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes updates or additions to a dataset. A Single update or
addition is an entry (JSON Line) that provides information about a
single image. To update an existing entry, you match the C<source-ref>
field of the update entry with the C<source-ref> filed of the entry
that you want to update. If the C<source-ref> field doesn't match an
existing entry, the entry is added to dataset as a new entry.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GroundTruth => Str

A Base64-encoded binary data object containing one or JSON lines that
either update the dataset or are additions to the dataset. You change a
dataset by calling UpdateDatasetEntries. If you are using an AWS SDK to
call C<UpdateDatasetEntries>, you don't need to encode C<Changes> as
the SDK encodes the data for you.

For example JSON lines, see Image-Level labels in manifest files and
and Object localization in manifest files in the I<Amazon Rekognition
Custom Labels Developer Guide>.
