=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::ProjectVersionDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::ProjectVersionDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseModelVersion => $value, ..., VersionDescription => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::ProjectVersionDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseModelVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A description of a version of a Amazon Rekognition project version.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaseModelVersion => Str

The base detection model version used to create the project version.


=head2 BillableTrainingTimeInSeconds => Int

The duration, in seconds, that you were billed for a successful
training of the model version. This value is only returned if the model
version has been successfully trained.


=head2 CreationTimestamp => Str

The Unix datetime for the date and time that training started.


=head2 EvaluationResult => L<Paws::Rekognition::EvaluationResult>

The training results. C<EvaluationResult> is only returned if training
is successful.


=head2 Feature => Str

The feature that was customized.


=head2 FeatureConfig => L<Paws::Rekognition::CustomizationFeatureConfig>

Feature specific configuration that was applied during training.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The identifer for the AWS Key Management Service key (AWS KMS key) that
was used to encrypt the model during training.


=head2 ManifestSummary => L<Paws::Rekognition::GroundTruthManifest>

The location of the summary manifest. The summary manifest provides
aggregate data validation results for the training and test datasets.


=head2 MaxInferenceUnits => Int

The maximum number of inference units Amazon Rekognition uses to
auto-scale the model. Applies only to Custom Labels projects. For more
information, see StartProjectVersion.


=head2 MinInferenceUnits => Int

The minimum number of inference units used by the model. Applies only
to Custom Labels projects. For more information, see
StartProjectVersion.


=head2 OutputConfig => L<Paws::Rekognition::OutputConfig>

The location where training results are saved.


=head2 ProjectVersionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the project version.


=head2 SourceProjectVersionArn => Str

If the model version was copied from a different project,
C<SourceProjectVersionArn> contains the ARN of the source model
version.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the model version.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A descriptive message for an error or warning that occurred.


=head2 TestingDataResult => L<Paws::Rekognition::TestingDataResult>

Contains information about the testing results.


=head2 TrainingDataResult => L<Paws::Rekognition::TrainingDataResult>

Contains information about the training results.


=head2 TrainingEndTimestamp => Str

The Unix date and time that training of the model ended.


=head2 VersionDescription => Str

A user-provided description of the project version.
