=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::ConnectedHomeSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::ConnectedHomeSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Labels => $value, ..., MinConfidence => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::ConnectedHomeSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Labels

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Label detection settings to use on a streaming video. Defining the
settings is required in the request parameter for
CreateStreamProcessor. Including this setting in the
C<CreateStreamProcessor> request enables you to use the stream
processor for label detection. You can then select what you want the
stream processor to detect, such as people or pets. When the stream
processor has started, one notification is sent for each object class
specified. For example, if packages and pets are selected, one SNS
notification is published the first time a package is detected and one
SNS notification is published the first time a pet is detected, as well
as an end-of-session summary.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Labels => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

packages, or pets. The current valid labels you can include in this
list are: "PERSON", "PET", "PACKAGE", and "ALL".


=head2 MinConfidence => Num

The minimum confidence required to label an object in the video.
