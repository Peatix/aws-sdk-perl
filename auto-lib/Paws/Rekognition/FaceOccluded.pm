=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::FaceOccluded

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::FaceOccluded object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Confidence => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::FaceOccluded object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Confidence

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<FaceOccluded> should return "true" with a high confidence score if a
detected faceE<rsquo>s eyes, nose, and mouth are partially captured or
if they are covered by masks, dark sunglasses, cell phones, hands, or
other objects. C<FaceOccluded> should return "false" with a high
confidence score if common occurrences that do not impact face
verification are detected, such as eye glasses, lightly tinted
sunglasses, strands of hair, and others.

You can use C<FaceOccluded> to determine if an obstruction on a face
negatively impacts using the image for face matching.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Confidence => Num

The confidence that the service has detected the presence of a face
occlusion.


=head2 Value => Bool

True if a detected faceE<rsquo>s eyes, nose, and mouth are partially
captured or if they are covered by masks, dark sunglasses, cell phones,
hands, or other objects. False if common occurrences that do not impact
face verification are detected, such as eye glasses, lightly tinted
sunglasses, strands of hair, and others.
