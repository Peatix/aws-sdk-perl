=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::BlackFrame

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::BlackFrame object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxPixelThreshold => $value, ..., MinCoveragePercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::BlackFrame object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxPixelThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter that allows you to control the black frame detection by
specifying the black levels and pixel coverage of black pixels in a
frame. As videos can come from multiple sources, formats, and time
periods, they may contain different standards and varying noise levels
for black frames that need to be accounted for. For more information,
see StartSegmentDetection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxPixelThreshold => Num

A threshold used to determine the maximum luminance value for a pixel
to be considered black. In a full color range video, luminance values
range from 0-255. A pixel value of 0 is pure black, and the most strict
filter. The maximum black pixel value is computed as follows:
max_black_pixel_value = minimum_luminance + MaxPixelThreshold
*luminance_range.

For example, for a full range video with BlackPixelThreshold = 0.1,
max_black_pixel_value is 0 + 0.1 * (255-0) = 25.5.

The default value of MaxPixelThreshold is 0.2, which maps to a
max_black_pixel_value of 51 for a full range video. You can lower this
threshold to be more strict on black levels.


=head2 MinCoveragePercentage => Num

The minimum percentage of pixels in a frame that need to have a
luminance below the max_black_pixel_value for a frame to be considered
a black frame. Luminance is calculated using the BT.709 matrix.

The default value is 99, which means at least 99% of all pixels in the
frame are black pixels as per the C<MaxPixelThreshold> set. You can
reduce this value to allow more noise on the black frame.
