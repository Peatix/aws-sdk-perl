=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::DatasetSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::DatasetSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatasetArn => $value, ..., GroundTruthManifest => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::DatasetSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatasetArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The source that Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels uses to create a
dataset. To use an Amazon Sagemaker format manifest file, specify the
S3 bucket location in the C<GroundTruthManifest> field. The S3 bucket
must be in your AWS account. To create a copy of an existing dataset,
specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing dataset in
C<DatasetArn>.

You need to specify a value for C<DatasetArn> or
C<GroundTruthManifest>, but not both. if you supply both values, or if
you don't specify any values, an InvalidParameterException exception
occurs.

For more information, see CreateDataset.
