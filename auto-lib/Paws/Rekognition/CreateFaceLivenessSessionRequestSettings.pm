=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::CreateFaceLivenessSessionRequestSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::CreateFaceLivenessSessionRequestSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuditImagesLimit => $value, ..., OutputConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::CreateFaceLivenessSessionRequestSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuditImagesLimit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A session settings object. It contains settings for the operation to be
performed. It accepts arguments for OutputConfig and AuditImagesLimit.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuditImagesLimit => Int

Number of audit images to be returned back. Takes an integer between
0-4. Any integer less than 0 will return 0, any integer above 4 will
return 4 images in the response. By default, it is set to 0. The limit
is best effort and is based on the actual duration of the selfie-video.


=head2 OutputConfig => L<Paws::Rekognition::LivenessOutputConfig>

Can specify the location of an Amazon S3 bucket, where reference and
audit images will be stored. Note that the Amazon S3 bucket must be
located in the caller's AWS account and in the same region as the Face
Liveness end-point. Additionally, the Amazon S3 object keys are
auto-generated by the Face Liveness system. Requires that the caller
has the C<s3:PutObject> permission on the Amazon S3 bucket.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Rekognition>
