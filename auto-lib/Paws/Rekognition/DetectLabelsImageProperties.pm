=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::DetectLabelsImageProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::DetectLabelsImageProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Background => $value, ..., Quality => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::DetectLabelsImageProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Background

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the quality and dominant colors of an input image.
Quality and color information is returned for the entire image,
foreground, and background.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

Information about the properties of an imageE<rsquo>s background,
including the backgroundE<rsquo>s quality and dominant colors,
including the quality and dominant colors of the image.


=head2 DominantColors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Rekognition::DominantColor>]

Information about the dominant colors found in an image, described with
RGB values, CSS color name, simplified color name, and PixelPercentage
(the percentage of image pixels that have a particular color).


=head2 Foreground => L<Paws::Rekognition::DetectLabelsImageForeground>

Information about the properties of an imageE<rsquo>s foreground,
