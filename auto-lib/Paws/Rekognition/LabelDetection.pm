=head1 NAME

Paws::Rekognition::LabelDetection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Rekognition::LabelDetection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DurationMillis => $value, ..., Timestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Rekognition::LabelDetection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DurationMillis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a label detected in a video analysis request and the
time the label was detected in the video.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DurationMillis => Int

The time duration of a segment in milliseconds, I.e. time elapsed from
StartTimestampMillis to EndTimestampMillis.


=head2 EndTimestampMillis => Int

The time in milliseconds defining the end of the timeline segment
containing a continuously detected label.


=head2 Label => L<Paws::Rekognition::Label>

Details about the detected label.


=head2 StartTimestampMillis => Int

The time in milliseconds defining the start of the timeline segment
containing a continuously detected label.


=head2 Timestamp => Int

Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was
detected. Note that C<Timestamp> is not guaranteed to be accurate to
the individual frame where the label first appears.



=head1 SEE ALSO
