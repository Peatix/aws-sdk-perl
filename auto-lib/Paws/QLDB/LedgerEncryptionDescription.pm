=head1 NAME

Paws::QLDB::LedgerEncryptionDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QLDB::LedgerEncryptionDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncryptionStatus => $value, ..., KmsKeyArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QLDB::LedgerEncryptionDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncryptionStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the encryption of data at rest in an Amazon QLDB
ledger. This includes the current status, the key in Key Management
Service (KMS), and when the key became inaccessible (in the case of an
error).

For more information, see Encryption at rest
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html)
in the I<Amazon QLDB Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncryptionStatus => Str

The current state of encryption at rest for the ledger. This can be one
of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<ENABLED>: Encryption is fully enabled using the specified key.

=item *

C<UPDATING>: The ledger is actively processing the specified key
change.

Key changes in QLDB are asynchronous. The ledger is fully accessible
without any performance impact while the key change is being processed.
The amount of time it takes to update a key varies depending on the
ledger size.

=item *

C<KMS_KEY_INACCESSIBLE>: The specified customer managed KMS key is not
accessible, and the ledger is impaired. Either the key was disabled or
deleted, or the grants on the key were revoked. When a ledger is
impaired, it is not accessible and does not accept any read or write
requests.

An impaired ledger automatically returns to an active state after you
restore the grants on the key, or re-enable the key that was disabled.
However, deleting a customer managed KMS key is irreversible. After a
key is deleted, you can no longer access the ledgers that are protected
with that key, and the data becomes unrecoverable permanently.

=back



=head2 InaccessibleKmsKeyDateTime => Str

The date and time, in epoch time format, when the KMS key first became
inaccessible, in the case of an error. (Epoch time format is the number
of seconds that have elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

This parameter is undefined if the KMS key is accessible.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KmsKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed KMS key that the
ledger uses for encryption at rest. If this parameter is undefined, the
ledger uses an Amazon Web Services owned KMS key for encryption. It
will display C<AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY> when updating the ledger's encryption
configuration to the Amazon Web Services owned KMS key.
