=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalousLogGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalousLogGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImpactEndTime => $value, ..., NumberOfLogLinesScanned => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalousLogGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImpactEndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An Amazon CloudWatch log group that contains log anomalies and is used
to generate an insight.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ImpactEndTime => Str

The time the anomalous log events stopped.


=head2 ImpactStartTime => Str

The time the anomalous log events began. The impact start time
indicates the time of the first log anomaly event that occurs.


=head2 LogAnomalyShowcases => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::LogAnomalyShowcase>]

The log anomalies in the log group. Each log anomaly displayed
represents a cluster of similar anomalous log events.


=head2 LogGroupName => Str

The name of the CloudWatch log group.


=head2 NumberOfLogLinesScanned => Int

The number of log lines that were scanned for anomalous log events.
