=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagCollection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagCollection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppBoundaryKey => $value, ..., TagValues => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagCollection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppBoundaryKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of Amazon Web Services tags.

Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources.
Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign
the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the
resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an
Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function.
For more information about using tags, see the Tagging best practices
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html)
whitepaper.

Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

=over

=item *

A tag I<key> (for example, C<CostCenter>, C<Environment>, C<Project>,
or C<Secret>). Tag I<keys> are case-sensitive.

=item *

An optional field known as a tag I<value> (for example,
C<111122223333>, C<Production>, or a team name). Omitting the tag
I<value> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag I<keys>, tag
I<values> are case-sensitive.

=back

Together these are known as I<key>-I<value> pairs.

The string used for a I<key> in a tag that you use to define your
resource coverage must begin with the prefix C<Devops-guru->. The tag
I<key> might be C<DevOps-Guru-deployment-application> or
C<devops-guru-rds-application>. When you create a I<key>, the case of
characters in the I<key> can be whatever you choose. After you create a
I<key>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a
I<key> named C<devops-guru-rds> and a I<key> named C<DevOps-Guru-RDS>,
and these act as two different I<keys>. Possible I<key>/I<value> pairs
in your application might be C<Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS>
or C<Devops-Guru-production-application/containers>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppBoundaryKey => Str

An Amazon Web Services tag I<key> that is used to identify the Amazon
Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web
Services resources in your account and Region tagged with this I<key>
make up your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

The string used for a I<key> in a tag that you use to define your
resource coverage must begin with the prefix C<Devops-guru->. The tag
I<key> might be C<DevOps-Guru-deployment-application> or
C<devops-guru-rds-application>. When you create a I<key>, the case of
characters in the I<key> can be whatever you choose. After you create a
I<key>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a
I<key> named C<devops-guru-rds> and a I<key> named C<DevOps-Guru-RDS>,
and these act as two different I<keys>. Possible I<key>/I<value> pairs
in your application might be C<Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS>
or C<Devops-Guru-production-application/containers>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TagValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

The tag's I<value> is an optional field used to associate a string with
the tag I<key> (for example, C<111122223333>, C<Production>, or a team
name). The I<key> and I<value> are the tag's I<key> pair. Omitting the
tag I<value> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag I<keys>,
tag I<values> are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum of 256
characters for a tag value.
