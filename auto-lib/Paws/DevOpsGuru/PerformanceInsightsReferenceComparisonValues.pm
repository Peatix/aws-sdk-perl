=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceComparisonValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceComparisonValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReferenceMetric => $value, ..., ReferenceScalar => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceComparisonValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReferenceMetric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Reference scalar values and other metrics that DevOps Guru displays on
a graph in its console along with the actual metrics it analyzed.
Compare these reference values to your actual metrics to help you
understand anomalous behavior that DevOps Guru detected.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReferenceMetric => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceMetric>

A metric that DevOps Guru compares to actual metric values. This
reference metric is used to determine if an actual metric should be
considered anomalous.


=head2 ReferenceScalar => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceScalar>

A scalar value DevOps Guru for a metric that DevOps Guru compares to
actual metric values. This reference value is used to determine if an
actual metric value should be considered anomalous.
