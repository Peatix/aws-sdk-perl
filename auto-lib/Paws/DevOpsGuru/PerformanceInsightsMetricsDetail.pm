=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricsDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricsDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricDisplayName => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricsDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricDisplayName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about Performance Insights metrics.

Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore
different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a
running DB instance. DB load is measured as average active sessions.
Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB
load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time
point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions,
measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User,
and Host.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricDisplayName => Str

The name used for a specific Performance Insights metric.


=head2 MetricQuery => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery>

A single query to be processed for the metric. For more information,
see C< PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/APIReference/API_PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery.html)
>.


=head2 ReferenceData => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsReferenceData>]

For more information, see C< PerformanceInsightsReferenceData
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/APIReference/API_PerformanceInsightsReferenceData.html)
>.


=head2 StatsAtAnomaly => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsStat>]

The metric statistics during the anomalous period detected by DevOps
Guru;


=head2 StatsAtBaseline => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsStat>]

Typical metric statistics that are not considered anomalous. When
DevOps Guru analyzes metrics, it compares them to C<StatsAtBaseline> to
help determine if they are anomalous.


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit of measure for a metric. For example, a session or a process.
