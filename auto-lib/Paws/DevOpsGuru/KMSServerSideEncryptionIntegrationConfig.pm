=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::KMSServerSideEncryptionIntegrationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::KMSServerSideEncryptionIntegrationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KMSKeyId => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::KMSServerSideEncryptionIntegrationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KMSKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about whether DevOps Guru is configured to encrypt
server-side data using KMS.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KMSKeyId => Str

Describes the specified KMS key.

To specify a KMS key, use its key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with "alias/". If you specify
a predefined Amazon Web Services alias (an Amazon Web Services alias
with no key ID), Amazon Web Services KMS associates the alias with an
Amazon Web Services managed key and returns its KeyId and Arn in the
response. To specify a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services
account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

For example:

Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

Key ARN:
arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias


=head2 OptInStatus => Str

Specifies if DevOps Guru is enabled for KMS integration.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of KMS key used. Customer managed keys are the KMS keys that
you create. Amazon Web Services owned keys are keys that are owned and
managed by DevOps Guru.
