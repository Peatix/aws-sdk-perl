=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about notification channels you have configured with DevOps
Guru. The one supported notification channel is Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filters => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::NotificationFilterConfig>

The filter configurations for the Amazon SNS notification topic you use
with DevOps Guru. If you do not provide filter configurations, the
default configurations are to receive notifications for all message
types of C<High> or C<Medium> severity.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Sns => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::SnsChannelConfig>

Information about a notification channel configured in DevOps Guru to
send notifications when insights are created.

If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a
policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to send it
notifications. DevOps Guru adds the required policy on your behalf to
send notifications using Amazon SNS in your account. DevOps Guru only
supports standard SNS topics. For more information, see Permissions for
Amazon SNS topics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-required-permissions.html).

If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is encrypted by an Amazon Web
Services Key Management Service customer-managed key (CMK), then you
must add permissions to the CMK. For more information, see Permissions
for Amazon Web Services KMSE<ndash>encrypted Amazon SNS topics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-kms-permissions.html).
