=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filter => $value, ..., Metric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single query to be processed. Use these parameters to query the
Performance Insights C<GetResourceMetrics> API to retrieve the metrics
for an anomaly. For more information, see C< GetResourceMetrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/performance-insights/latest/APIReference/API_GetResourceMetrics.html)
> in the I<Amazon RDS Performance Insights API Reference>.

Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore
different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a
running DB instance. DB load is measured as average active sessions.
Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB
load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time
point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions,
measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User,
and Host.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricFilterMap>

One or more filters to apply to a Performance Insights
C<GetResourceMetrics> API query. Restrictions:

=over

=item *

Any number of filters by the same dimension, as specified in the
C<GroupBy> parameter.

=item *

A single filter for any other dimension in this dimension group.

=back



=head2 GroupBy => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup>

The specification for how to aggregate the data points from a
Performance Insights C<GetResourceMetrics> API query. The Performance
Insights query returns all of the dimensions within that group, unless
you provide the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can
also request that Performance Insights return a limited number of
values for a dimension.


=head2 Metric => Str

The name of the meteric used used when querying an Performance Insights
C<GetResourceMetrics> API for anomaly metrics.

Valid values for C<Metric> are:

=over

=item *

C<db.load.avg> - a scaled representation of the number of active
sessions for the database engine.

=item *

C<db.sampledload.avg> - the raw number of active sessions for the
database engine.

=back

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance
Insights threshold, C<db.load.avg> and C<db.sampledload.avg> are the
same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the
internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions,
with C<db.load.avg> showing the scaled values, C<db.sampledload.avg>
showing the raw values, and C<db.sampledload.avg> less than
C<db.load.avg>. For most use cases, you can query C<db.load.avg> only.
