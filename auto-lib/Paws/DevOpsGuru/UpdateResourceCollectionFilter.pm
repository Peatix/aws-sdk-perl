=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::UpdateResourceCollectionFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::UpdateResourceCollectionFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CloudFormation => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::UpdateResourceCollectionFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CloudFormation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information used to update a collection of Amazon Web Services
resources.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CloudFormation => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::UpdateCloudFormationCollectionFilter>

A collection of Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks. You can
specify up to 500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::UpdateTagCollectionFilter>]

The updated Amazon Web Services tags used to filter the resources in
the resource collection.

Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources.
Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging, so you can assign
the same tag to resources from different services to indicate that the
resources are related. For example, you can assign the same tag to an
Amazon DynamoDB table resource that you assign to an Lambda function.
For more information about using tags, see the Tagging best practices
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html)
whitepaper.

Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

=over

=item *

A tag I<key> (for example, C<CostCenter>, C<Environment>, C<Project>,
or C<Secret>). Tag I<keys> are case-sensitive.

=item *

An optional field known as a tag I<value> (for example,
C<111122223333>, C<Production>, or a team name). Omitting the tag
I<value> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag I<keys>, tag
I<values> are case-sensitive.

=back

Together these are known as I<key>-I<value> pairs.

The string used for a I<key> in a tag that you use to define your
resource coverage must begin with the prefix C<Devops-guru->. The tag
I<key> might be C<DevOps-Guru-deployment-application> or
C<devops-guru-rds-application>. When you create a I<key>, the case of
characters in the I<key> can be whatever you choose. After you create a
I<key>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a
I<key> named C<devops-guru-rds> and a I<key> named C<DevOps-Guru-RDS>,
and these act as two different I<keys>. Possible I<key>/I<value> pairs
in your application might be C<Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS>
or C<Devops-Guru-production-application/containers>.
