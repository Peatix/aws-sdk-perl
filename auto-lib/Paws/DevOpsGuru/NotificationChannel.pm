=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a notification channel. A notification channel is
used to notify you when DevOps Guru creates an insight. The one
supported notification channel is Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS).

If you use an Amazon SNS topic in another account, you must attach a
policy to it that grants DevOps Guru permission to send it
notifications. DevOps Guru adds the required policy on your behalf to
send notifications using Amazon SNS in your account. DevOps Guru only
supports standard SNS topics. For more information, see Permissions for
Amazon SNS topics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-required-permissions.html).

If you use an Amazon SNS topic that is encrypted by an Amazon Web
Services Key Management Service customer-managed key (CMK), then you
must add permissions to the CMK. For more information, see Permissions
for Amazon Web Services KMSE<ndash>encrypted Amazon SNS topics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/sns-kms-permissions.html).
