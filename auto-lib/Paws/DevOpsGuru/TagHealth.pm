Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagHealth

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagHealth object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnalyzedResourceCount => $value, ..., TagValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::TagHealth object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnalyzedResourceCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the health of Amazon Web Services resources in your
account that are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag I<key>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnalyzedResourceCount => Int

Number of resources that DevOps Guru is monitoring in your account that
are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag.


=head2 AppBoundaryKey => Str

An Amazon Web Services tag I<key> that is used to identify the Amazon
Web Services resources that DevOps Guru analyzes. All Amazon Web
Services resources in your account and Region tagged with this I<key>
make up your DevOps Guru application and analysis boundary.

The string used for a I<key> in a tag that you use to define your
resource coverage must begin with the prefix C<Devops-guru->. The tag
I<key> might be C<DevOps-Guru-deployment-application> or
C<devops-guru-rds-application>. When you create a I<key>, the case of
characters in the I<key> can be whatever you choose. After you create a
I<key>, it is case-sensitive. For example, DevOps Guru works with a
I<key> named C<devops-guru-rds> and a I<key> named C<DevOps-Guru-RDS>,
and these act as two different I<keys>. Possible I<key>/I<value> pairs
in your application might be C<Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS>
or C<Devops-Guru-production-application/containers>.


=head2 Insight => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::InsightHealth>

Information about the health of the Amazon Web Services resources in
your account that are specified by an Amazon Web Services tag,
including the number of open proactive, open reactive insights, and the
Mean Time to Recover (MTTR) of closed insights.


=head2 TagValue => Str

The value in an Amazon Web Services tag.

The tag's I<value> is an optional field used to associate a string with
the tag I<key> (for example, C<111122223333>, C<Production>, or a team
name). The I<key> and I<value> are the tag's I<key> pair. Omitting the
tag I<value> is the same as using an empty string. Like tag I<keys>,
tag I<values> are case-sensitive. You can specify a maximum of 256
characters for a tag value.
