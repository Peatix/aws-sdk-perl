=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::ReactiveAnomalySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::ReactiveAnomalySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnomalyReportedTimeRange => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::ReactiveAnomalySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnomalyReportedTimeRange

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about a reactive anomaly. This object is returned by
C<DescribeAnomaly.>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnomalyReportedTimeRange => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalyReportedTimeRange>

An C<AnomalyReportedTimeRange> object that specifies the time range
between when the anomaly is opened and the time when it is closed.


=head2 AnomalyResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalyResource>]

The Amazon Web Services resources in which anomalous behavior was
detected by DevOps Guru.


=head2 AnomalyTimeRange => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalyTimeRange>




=head2 AssociatedInsightId => Str

The ID of the insight that contains this anomaly. An insight is
composed of related anomalies.


=head2 CausalAnomalyId => Str

The ID of the causal anomaly that is associated with this reactive
anomaly. The ID of a `CAUSAL` anomaly is always `NULL`.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the reactive anomaly.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID of the reactive anomaly.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the reactive anomaly.


=head2 ResourceCollection => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::ResourceCollection>




=head2 Severity => Str

The severity of the anomaly. The severity of anomalies that generate an
insight determine that insight's severity. For more information, see
Understanding insight severities
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/working-with-insights.html#understanding-insights-severities)
in the I<Amazon DevOps Guru User Guide>.


=head2 SourceDetails => L<Paws::DevOpsGuru::AnomalySourceDetails>

Details about the source of the analyzed operational data that
triggered the anomaly. The one supported source is Amazon CloudWatch
metrics.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the reactive anomaly.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of the reactive anomaly. It can be one of the following types.

=over

=item *

C<CAUSAL> - the anomaly can cause a new insight.

=item *

C<CONTEXTUAL> - the anomaly contains additional information about an
insight or its causal anomaly.

=back
