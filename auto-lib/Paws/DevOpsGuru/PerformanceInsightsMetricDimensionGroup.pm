=head1 NAME

Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Limit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DevOpsGuru::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A logical grouping of Performance Insights metrics for a related
subject area. For example, the C<db.sql> dimension group consists of
the following dimensions: C<db.sql.id>, C<db.sql.db_id>,
C<db.sql.statement>, and C<db.sql.tokenized_id>.

Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger
elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are
returned.

Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore
different dimensions of database load based on data captured from a
running DB instance. DB load is measured as average active sessions.
Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB
load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time
point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions,
measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User,
and Host.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If this parameter
is not present, then it signifies that all of the dimensions in the
group were requested or are present in the response.

Valid values for elements in the C<Dimensions> array are:

=over

C<db.application.name> - The name of the application that is connected
to the database (only Aurora PostgreSQL and RDS PostgreSQL)

=item *

C<db.host.id> - The host ID of the connected client (all engines)

=item *

C<db.host.name> - The host name of the connected client (all engines)

=item *

C<db.name> - The name of the database to which the client is connected
(only Aurora PostgreSQL, Amazon RDS PostgreSQL, Aurora MySQL, Amazon
RDS MySQL, and MariaDB)

=item *
