=head1 NAME

Paws::Textract::IdentityDocument

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Textract::IdentityDocument object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Blocks => $value, ..., IdentityDocumentFields => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Textract::IdentityDocument object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Blocks

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure that lists each document processed in an AnalyzeID
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Blocks => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Textract::Block>]

Individual word recognition, as returned by document detection.


=head2 DocumentIndex => Int

Denotes the placement of a document in the IdentityDocument list. The
first document is marked 1, the second 2 and so on.


=head2 IdentityDocumentFields => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Textract::IdentityDocumentField>]

The structure used to record information extracted from identity
documents. Contains both normalized field and value of the extracted
text.
