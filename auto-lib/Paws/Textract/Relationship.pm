=head1 NAME

Paws::Textract::Relationship

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Textract::Relationship object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Ids => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Textract::Relationship object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Ids

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about how blocks are related to each other. A C<Block>
object contains 0 or more C<Relation> objects in a list,
C<Relationships>. For more information, see Block.

The C<Type> element provides the type of the relationship for all
blocks in the C<IDs> array.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Ids => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of IDs for related blocks. You can get the type of the
relationship from the C<Type> element.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of relationship between the blocks in the IDs array and the
current block. The following list describes the relationship types that
can be returned.

=over

=item *

I<VALUE> - A list that contains the ID of the VALUE block that's
associated with the KEY of a key-value pair.

=item *

I<CHILD> - A list of IDs that identify blocks found within the current
block object. For example, WORD blocks have a CHILD relationship to the
LINE block type.

=item *

I<MERGED_CELL> - A list of IDs that identify each of the MERGED_CELL
block types in a table.

=item *

I<ANSWER> - A list that contains the ID of the QUERY_RESULT block
thatE<rsquo>s associated with the corresponding QUERY block.

=item *

I<TABLE> - A list of IDs that identify associated TABLE block types.

=item *

I<TABLE_TITLE> - A list that contains the ID for the TABLE_TITLE block
type in a table.

=item *

I<TABLE_FOOTER> - A list of IDs that identify the TABLE_FOOTER block
types in a table.
