=head1 NAME

Paws::Textract::ExpenseField

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Textract::ExpenseField object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Currency => $value, ..., ValueDetection => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Textract::ExpenseField object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Currency

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Breakdown of detected information, seperated into the catagories Type,
LabelDetection, and ValueDetection

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Currency => L<Paws::Textract::ExpenseCurrency>

Shows the kind of currency, both the code and confidence associated
with any monatary value detected.


=head2 GroupProperties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Textract::ExpenseGroupProperty>]

Shows which group a response object belongs to, such as whether an
address line belongs to the vendor's address or the recipent's address.


=head2 LabelDetection => L<Paws::Textract::ExpenseDetection>

The explicitly stated label of a detected element.


=head2 PageNumber => Int

The page number the value was detected on.


=head2 Type => L<Paws::Textract::ExpenseType>

The implied label of a detected element. Present alongside
LabelDetection for explicit elements.


=head2 ValueDetection => L<Paws::Textract::ExpenseDetection>

The value of a detected element. Present in explicit and implicit
elements.



=head1 SEE ALSO
