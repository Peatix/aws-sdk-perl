=head1 NAME

Paws::Textract::AdapterVersionEvaluationMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Textract::AdapterVersionEvaluationMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdapterVersion => $value, ..., FeatureType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Textract::AdapterVersionEvaluationMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdapterVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information on the metrics used to evalute the peformance of a
given adapter version. Includes data for baseline model performance and
individual adapter version perfromance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdapterVersion => L<Paws::Textract::EvaluationMetric>

The F1 score, precision, and recall metrics for the baseline model.


=head2 Baseline => L<Paws::Textract::EvaluationMetric>

The F1 score, precision, and recall metrics for the baseline model.


=head2 FeatureType => Str

Indicates the feature type being analyzed by a given adapter version.



=head1 SEE ALSO
