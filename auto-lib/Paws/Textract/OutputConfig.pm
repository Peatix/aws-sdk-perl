=head1 NAME

Paws::Textract::OutputConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Textract::OutputConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { S3Bucket => $value, ..., S3Prefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Textract::OutputConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->S3Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets whether or not your output will go to a user created bucket. Used
to set the name of the bucket, and the prefix on the output file.

C<OutputConfig> is an optional parameter which lets you adjust where
your output will be placed. By default, Amazon Textract will store the
results internally and can only be accessed by the Get API operations.
With C<OutputConfig> enabled, you can set the name of the bucket the
output will be sent to the file prefix of the results where you can
download your results. Additionally, you can set the C<KMSKeyID>
parameter to a customer master key (CMK) to encrypt your output.
Without this parameter set Amazon Textract will encrypt server-side
using the AWS managed CMK for Amazon S3.

Decryption of Customer Content is necessary for processing of the
documents by Amazon Textract. If your account is opted out under an AI
services opt out policy then all unencrypted Customer Content is
immediately and permanently deleted after the Customer Content has been
processed by the service. No copy of of the output is retained by
Amazon Textract. For information about how to opt out, see Managing AI
services opt-out policy.
