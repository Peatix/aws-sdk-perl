=head1 NAME

Paws::RedShift::DescribeEndpointAuthorization - Arguments for method DescribeEndpointAuthorization on L<Paws::RedShift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeEndpointAuthorization on the
L<Amazon Redshift|Paws::RedShift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeEndpointAuthorization.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeEndpointAuthorization.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $redshift = Paws->service('RedShift');
    my $EndpointAuthorizationList = $redshift->DescribeEndpointAuthorization(
      Account           => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL
      ClusterIdentifier => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL
      Grantee           => 1,             # OPTIONAL
      Marker            => 'MyString',    # OPTIONAL
      MaxRecords        => 1,             # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $EndpointAuthorizationList =
      $EndpointAuthorizationList->EndpointAuthorizationList;
    my $Marker = $EndpointAuthorizationList->Marker;

    # Returns a L<Paws::RedShift::EndpointAuthorizationList> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Account => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID of either the cluster owner
(grantor) or grantee. If C<Grantee> parameter is true, then the
C<Account> value is of the grantor.



=head2 ClusterIdentifier => Str

The cluster identifier of the cluster to access.



=head2 Grantee => Bool

Indicates whether to check authorization from a grantor or grantee
point of view. If true, Amazon Redshift returns endpoint authorizations
that you've been granted. If false (default), checks authorization from
a grantor point of view.



=head2 Marker => Str

An optional pagination token provided by a previous
C<DescribeEndpointAuthorization> request. If this parameter is
specified, the response includes only records beyond the marker, up to
the value specified by the C<MaxRecords> parameter.



=head2 MaxRecords => Int

The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more
records exist than the specified C<MaxRecords> value, a pagination
token called a C<Marker> is included in the response so that the
remaining results can be retrieved.
