=head1 NAME

Paws::QConnect::ChunkingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QConnect::ChunkingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChunkingStrategy => $value, ..., SemanticChunkingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QConnect::ChunkingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChunkingStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about how to chunk the documents in the data source. A chunk
refers to an excerpt from a data source that is returned when the
knowledge base that it belongs to is queried.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ChunkingStrategy => Str

Knowledge base can split your source data into chunks. A chunk refers
to an excerpt from a data source that is returned when the knowledge
base that it belongs to is queried. You have the following options for
chunking your data. If you opt for C<NONE>, then you may want to
pre-process your files by splitting them up such that each file
corresponds to a chunk.


=head2 FixedSizeChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::QConnect::FixedSizeChunkingConfiguration>

Configurations for when you choose fixed-size chunking. If you set the
C<chunkingStrategy> as C<NONE>, exclude this field.


=head2 HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::QConnect::HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration>

Settings for hierarchical document chunking for a data source.
Hierarchical chunking splits documents into layers of chunks where the
first layer contains large chunks, and the second layer contains
smaller chunks derived from the first layer.


=head2 SemanticChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::QConnect::SemanticChunkingConfiguration>

Settings for semantic document chunking for a data source. Semantic
chunking splits a document into smaller documents based on groups of
similar content derived from the text with natural language processing.
