=head2 CrawlerLimits => L<Paws::QConnect::WebCrawlerLimits>

The configuration of crawl limits for the web URLs.


=head2 ExclusionFilters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of one or more exclusion regular expression patterns to exclude
certain URLs. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter/pattern
and both match a URL, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the web
content of the URL isnE<rsquo>t crawled.


=head2 InclusionFilters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of one or more inclusion regular expression patterns to include
certain URLs. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter/pattern
and both match a URL, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the web
content of the URL isnE<rsquo>t crawled.

The scope of what is crawled for your URLs. You can choose to crawl
only web pages that belong to the same host or primary domain. For
example, only web pages that contain the seed URL
C<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/> and no other
domains. You can choose to include sub domains in addition to the host
or primary domain. For example, web pages that contain
C<aws.amazon.com> can also include sub domain C<docs.aws.amazon.com>.
