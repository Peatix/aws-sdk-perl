=head1 NAME

Paws::QConnect::ParsingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QConnect::ParsingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BedrockFoundationModelConfiguration => $value, ..., ParsingStrategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QConnect::ParsingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BedrockFoundationModelConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for parsing document contents. By default, the service
converts the contents of each document into text before splitting it
into chunks. To improve processing of PDF files with tables and images,
you can configure the data source to convert the pages of text into
images and use a model to describe the contents of each page.
