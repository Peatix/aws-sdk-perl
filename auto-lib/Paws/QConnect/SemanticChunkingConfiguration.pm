=head1 NAME

Paws::QConnect::SemanticChunkingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QConnect::SemanticChunkingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BreakpointPercentileThreshold => $value, ..., MaxTokens => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QConnect::SemanticChunkingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BreakpointPercentileThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for semantic document chunking for a data source. Semantic
chunking splits a document into smaller documents based on groups of
similar content derived from the text with natural language processing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BreakpointPercentileThreshold => Int

The dissimilarity threshold for splitting chunks.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BufferSize => Int

The buffer size.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxTokens => Int

The maximum number of tokens that a chunk can contain.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::QConnect>
