=head1 NAME

Paws::PerformanceInsights::ResponseResourceMetricKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PerformanceInsights::ResponseResourceMetricKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Metric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PerformanceInsights::ResponseResourceMetricKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object describing a Performance Insights metric and one or more
dimensions for that metric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => L<Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionMap>

The valid dimensions for the metric.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metric => Str

The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid values for C<Metric> are:

=over

=item *

C<db.load.avg> - A scaled representation of the number of active
sessions for the database engine.

=item *

C<db.sampledload.avg> - The raw number of active sessions for the
database engine.

=item *

The counter metrics listed in Performance Insights operating system
counters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.OS)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.

in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide>.

=back

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance
Insights threshold, C<db.load.avg> and C<db.sampledload.avg> are the
same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the
internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions,
with C<db.load.avg> showing the scaled values, C<db.sampledload.avg>
showing the raw values, and C<db.sampledload.avg> less than
C<db.load.avg>. For most use cases, you can query C<db.load.avg> only.
