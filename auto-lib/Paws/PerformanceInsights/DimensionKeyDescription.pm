=head1 NAME

Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionKeyDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionKeyDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalMetrics => $value, ..., Total => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionKeyDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that includes the requested dimension key values and
aggregated metric values within a dimension group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalMetrics => L<Paws::PerformanceInsights::AdditionalMetricsMap>

A map that contains the value for each additional metric.


=head2 Dimensions => L<Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionMap>

A map of name-value pairs for the dimensions in the group.


=head2 Partitions => ArrayRef[Num]

If C<PartitionBy> was specified, C<PartitionKeys> contains the
dimensions that were.


=head2 Total => Num

The aggregated metric value for the dimensions, over the requested time
range.
