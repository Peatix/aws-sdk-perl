=head1 NAME

Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Limit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PerformanceInsights::DimensionGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A logical grouping of Performance Insights metrics for a related
subject area. For example, the C<db.sql> dimension group consists of
the following dimensions:

=over

=item *

C<db.sql.id> - The hash of a running SQL statement, generated by
Performance Insights.

=item *

C<db.sql.db_id> - Either the SQL ID generated by the database engine,
or a value generated by Performance Insights that begins with C<pi->.

=item *

C<db.sql.statement> - The full text of the SQL statement that is
running, for example, C<SELECT * FROM employees>.

=item *

C<db.sql_tokenized.id> - The hash of the SQL digest generated by
Performance Insights.

=back

Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger
elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are
returned.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If this parameter
is not present, then it signifies that all of the dimensions in the
group were requested, or are present in the response.

Valid values for elements in the C<Dimensions> array are:

=over

=item *

C<db.application.name> - The name of the application that is connected
to the database. Valid values are as follows:

=over

=item *

Aurora PostgreSQL

=item *

Amazon RDS PostgreSQL

=item *

Amazon DocumentDB

=back

=item *

C<db.blocking_sql.id> - The ID for each of the SQL queries blocking the
most DB load.

=item *

C<db.blocking_sql.sql> - The SQL text for each of the SQL queries
blocking the most DB load.

=item *

C<db.blocking_session.id> - The ID for each of the sessions blocking
the most DB load.

=item *

C<db.blocking_object.id> - The ID for each of the object resources
acquired by other sessions that are blocking the most DB load.

=item *

C<db.blocking_object.type> - The object type for each of the object
resources acquired by other sessions that are blocking the most DB
load.

=item *

C<db.blocking_object.value> - The value for each of the object
resources acquired by other sessions that are blocking the most DB
load.

=item *

C<db.host.id> - The host ID of the connected client (all engines).

=item *

C<db.host.name> - The host name of the connected client (all engines).

=item *

C<db.name> - The name of the database to which the client is connected.
Valid values are as follows:

=over

=item *

=item *

Amazon RDS PostgreSQL

=item *

Aurora MySQL

=item *

Amazon RDS MySQL

=item *

Amazon RDS MariaDB

=item *

=back

=item *

C<db.query.id> - The query ID generated by Performance Insights (only
Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.query.db_id> - The query ID generated by the database (only Amazon
DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.query.statement> - The text of the query that is being run (only
Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.query.tokenized_id>

=item *

C<db.query.tokenized.id> - The query digest ID generated by Performance
Insights (only Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.query.tokenized.db_id> - The query digest ID generated by
Performance Insights (only Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.query.tokenized.statement> - The text of the query digest (only
Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.session_type.name> - The type of the current session (only Amazon
DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.sql.id> - The hash of the full, non-tokenized SQL statement
generated by Performance Insights (all engines except Amazon
DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.sql.db_id> - Either the SQL ID generated by the database engine,
or a value generated by Performance Insights that begins with C<pi->
(all engines except Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.sql.statement> - The full text of the SQL statement that is
running, as in C<SELECT * FROM employees> (all engines except Amazon
DocumentDB)

=item *

C<db.sql.tokenized_id> - The hash of the SQL digest generated by
Performance Insights (all engines except Amazon DocumentDB). The
C<db.sql.tokenized_id> dimension fetches the value of the
C<db.sql_tokenized.id> dimension. Amazon RDS returns
C<db.sql.tokenized_id> from the C<db.sql> dimension group.

=item *

C<db.sql_tokenized.id> - The hash of the SQL digest generated by
Performance Insights (all engines except Amazon DocumentDB). In the
console, C<db.sql_tokenized.id> is called the Support ID because Amazon
Web Services Support can look at this data to help you troubleshoot
database issues.

=item *

C<db.sql_tokenized.db_id> - Either the native database ID used to refer
to the SQL statement, or a synthetic ID such as C<pi-2372568224> that
Performance Insights generates if the native database ID isn't
available (all engines except Amazon DocumentDB).

=item *

C<db.sql_tokenized.statement> - The text of the SQL digest, as in
C<SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = ?> (all engines except
Amazon DocumentDB)
