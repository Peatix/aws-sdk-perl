=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $snowball = Paws->service('Snowball');
    my $CreateLongTermPricingResult = $snowball->CreateLongTermPricing(
      LongTermPricingType        => 'OneYear',
      SnowballType               => 'STANDARD',
      IsLongTermPricingAutoRenew => 1,            # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LongTermPricingId = $CreateLongTermPricingResult->LongTermPricingId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Snowball::CreateLongTermPricingResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
