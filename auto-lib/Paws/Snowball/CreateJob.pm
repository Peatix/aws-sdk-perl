Paws::Snowball::CreateJob - Arguments for method CreateJob on L<Paws::Snowball>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateJob on the
L<Amazon ImportE<sol>Export Snowball|Paws::Snowball> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateJob.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateJob.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $snowball = Paws->service('Snowball');
 # To create a job
 # Creates a job to import or export data between Amazon S3 and your on-premises
 # data center. Your AWS account must have the right trust policies and
 # permissions in place to create a job for Snowball. If you're creating a job
 # for a node in a cluster, you only need to provide the clusterId value; the
 # other job attributes are inherited from the cluster.
    my $CreateJobResult = $snowball->CreateJob(
      'AddressId'   => 'ADID1234ab12-3eec-4eb3-9be6-9374c10eb51b',
      'Description' => 'My Job',
      'JobType'     => 'IMPORT',
      'KmsKeyARN'   =>
'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/abcd1234-12ab-34cd-56ef-123456123456',
      'Notification' => {
        'JobStatesToNotify' => [

        ],
        'NotifyAll' => 0
      },
      'Resources' => {
        'S3Resources' => [

          {
            'BucketArn' => 'arn:aws:s3:::MyBucket',
            'KeyRange'  => {

            }
          }
        ]
      },
      'RoleARN' => 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/snowball-import-S3-role',
      'ShippingOption'             => 'SECOND_DAY',
      'SnowballCapacityPreference' => 'T80',
      'SnowballType'               => 'STANDARD'
    );

    # Results:
    my $JobId = $CreateJobResult->JobId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Snowball::CreateJobResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
