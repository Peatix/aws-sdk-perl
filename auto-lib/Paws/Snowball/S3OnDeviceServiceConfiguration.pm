=head1 NAME

Paws::Snowball::S3OnDeviceServiceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Snowball::S3OnDeviceServiceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FaultTolerance => $value, ..., StorageUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Snowball::S3OnDeviceServiceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FaultTolerance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow family devices configuration
items.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FaultTolerance => Int

E<gt>Fault tolerance level of the cluster. This indicates the number of
nodes that can go down without degrading the performance of the
cluster. This additional input helps when the specified C<StorageLimit>
matches more than one Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow family
devices service configuration.


=head2 ServiceSize => Int

Applicable when creating a cluster. Specifies how many nodes are needed
for Amazon S3 compatible storage on Snow family devices. If specified,
the other input can be omitted.


=head2 StorageLimit => Num

If the specified storage limit value matches storage limit of one of
the defined configurations, that configuration will be used. If the
specified storage limit value does not match any defined configuration,
the request will fail. If more than one configuration has the same
storage limit as specified, the other input need to be provided.


=head2 StorageUnit => Str

Storage unit. Currently the only supported unit is TB.
