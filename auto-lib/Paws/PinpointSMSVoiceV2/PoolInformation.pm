=head1 NAME

Paws::PinpointSMSVoiceV2::PoolInformation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PinpointSMSVoiceV2::PoolInformation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedTimestamp => $value, ..., TwoWayEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PinpointSMSVoiceV2::PoolInformation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The information for a pool in an Amazon Web Services account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedTimestamp => Str

The time when the pool was created, in UNIX epoch time
(https://www.epochconverter.com/) format.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeletionProtectionEnabled => Bool

When set to true the pool can't be deleted.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MessageType => Str

The type of message. Valid values are TRANSACTIONAL for messages that
are critical or time-sensitive and PROMOTIONAL for messages that aren't
critical or time-sensitive.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OptOutListName => Str

The name of the OptOutList associated with the pool.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PoolArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pool.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PoolId => Str

The unique identifier for the pool.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SelfManagedOptOutsEnabled => Bool

When set to false, an end recipient sends a message that begins with
HELP or STOP to one of your dedicated numbers, AWS End User Messaging
SMS and Voice automatically replies with a customizable message and
adds the end recipient to the OptOutList. When set to true you're
responsible for responding to HELP and STOP requests. You're also
responsible for tracking and honoring opt-out requests. For more
information see Self-managed opt-outs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/settings-sms-managing.html#settings-account-sms-self-managed-opt-out)


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SharedRoutesEnabled => Bool

Allows you to enable shared routes on your pool.

By default, this is set to C<False>. If you set this value to C<True>,
your messages are sent using phone numbers or sender IDs (depending on
the country) that are shared with other users. In some countries, such
as the United States, senders aren't allowed to use shared routes and
must use a dedicated phone number or short code.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The current status of the pool.


=head2 TwoWayChannelArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the two way channel.


=head2 TwoWayChannelRole => Str

An optional IAM Role Arn for a service to assume, to be able to post
inbound SMS messages.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TwoWayEnabled => Bool

When set to true you can receive incoming text messages from your end
recipients using the TwoWayChannelArn.
