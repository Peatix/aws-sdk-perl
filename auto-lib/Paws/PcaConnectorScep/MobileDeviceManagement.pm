=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorScep::MobileDeviceManagement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorScep::MobileDeviceManagement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Intune => $value, ..., Intune => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorScep::MobileDeviceManagement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Intune

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you don't supply a value, by default Connector for SCEP creates a
connector for general-purpose use. A general-purpose connector is
designed to work with clients or endpoints that support the SCEP
protocol, except Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune. For
information about considerations and limitations with using Connector
for SCEP, see Considerations and Limitations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlc4scep-considerations-limitations.html).

If you provide an C<IntuneConfiguration>, Connector for SCEP creates a
connector for use with Microsoft Intune, and you manage the challenge
passwords using Microsoft Intune. For more information, see Using
Connector for SCEP for Microsoft Intune
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/scep-connector.htmlconnector-for-scep-intune.html).
