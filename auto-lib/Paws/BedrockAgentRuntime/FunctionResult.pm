=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::FunctionResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::FunctionResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionGroup => $value, ..., ResponseState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::FunctionResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionGroup

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the function that was called from the action
group and the response that was returned.

This data type is used in the following API operations:

=over

=item *

In the C<returnControlInvocationResults> of the InvokeAgent request
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_InvokeAgent.html#API_agent-runtime_InvokeAgent_RequestSyntax)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActionGroup => Str

The action group that the function belongs to.


=head2 AgentId => Str

The agent's ID.


=head2 ConfirmationState => Str

Contains the user confirmation information about the function that was
called.


=head2 Function => Str

The name of the function that was called.


=head2 ResponseBody => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ResponseBody>

The response from the function call using the parameters. The response
might be returned directly or from the Lambda function. Specify C<TEXT>
or C<IMAGES>. The key of the object is the content type. You can only
specify one type. If you specify C<IMAGES>, you can specify only one
image. You can specify images only when the function in the
C<returnControlInvocationResults> is a computer use action. For more
information, see Configure an Amazon Bedrock Agent to complete tasks
with computer use tools
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agent-computer-use.html).


=head2 ResponseState => Str

Controls the final response state returned to end user when
API/Function execution failed. When this state is FAILURE, the request
would fail with dependency failure exception. When this state is
REPROMPT, the API/function response will be sent to model for re-prompt
