=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Metadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Metadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientRequestId => $value, ..., Usage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Metadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientRequestId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the execution process for different types of
invocations, such as model invocation, knowledge base invocation, agent
collaborator invocation, guardrail invocation, and code interpreter
Invocation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientRequestId => Str

A unique identifier associated with the downstream invocation. This ID
can be used for tracing, debugging, and identifying specific
invocations in customer logs or systems.


=head2 EndTime => Str

In the final response, C<endTime> is the end time time of the agent
invocation operation.


=head2 OperationTotalTimeMs => Int

The total time it took for the agent to complete execution. This field
is only set for the final response.


=head2 StartTime => Str

In the final response, C<startTime> is the start time of the agent
invocation operation.


=head2 TotalTimeMs => Int

The total execution time for the specific invocation being processed
(model, knowledge base, guardrail, agent collaborator, or code
interpreter). It represents how long the individual invocation took.


=head2 Usage => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Usage>

Specific to model invocation and contains details about the usage of a
foundation model.
