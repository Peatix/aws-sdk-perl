=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::StreamingConfigurations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::StreamingConfigurations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplyGuardrailInterval => $value, ..., StreamFinalResponse => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::StreamingConfigurations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplyGuardrailInterval

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configurations for streaming.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApplyGuardrailInterval => Int

The guardrail interval to apply as response is generated. By default,
the guardrail interval is set to 50 characters. If a larger interval is
specified, the response will be generated in larger chunks with fewer
C<ApplyGuardrail> calls. The following examples show the response
generated for I<Hello, I am an agent> input string.

B<Example response in chunks: Interval set to 3 characters>

C<'Hel', 'lo, ','I am', ' an', ' Age', 'nt'>

Each chunk has at least 3 characters except for the last chunk

B<Example response in chunks: Interval set to 20 or more characters>

C<Hello, I am an Agent>


=head2 StreamFinalResponse => Bool

Specifies whether to enable streaming for the final response. This is
set to C<false> by default.
