=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::TracePart

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::TracePart object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AgentAliasId => $value, ..., Trace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::TracePart object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AgentAliasId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the agent and session, alongside the agent's
reasoning process and results from calling API actions and querying
knowledge bases and metadata about the trace. You can use the trace to
understand how the agent arrived at the response it provided the
customer. For more information, see Trace enablement
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-test.html#trace-enablement).

=head2 AgentAliasId => Str

The unique identifier of the alias of the agent.


=head2 AgentId => Str

The unique identifier of the agent.


=head2 AgentVersion => Str

The version of the agent.


=head2 CallerChain => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Caller>]
