=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::OptimizedPromptStream

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::OptimizedPromptStream object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessDeniedException => $value, ..., ValidationException => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::OptimizedPromptStream object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessDeniedException

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The stream containing events in the prompt optimization process.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessDeniedException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::AccessDeniedException>

The request is denied because of missing access permissions. Check your
permissions and retry your request.


=head2 AnalyzePromptEvent => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::AnalyzePromptEvent>

An event in which the prompt was analyzed in preparation for
optimization.


=head2 BadGatewayException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::BadGatewayException>

There was an issue with a dependency due to a server issue. Retry your
request.


=head2 DependencyFailedException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::DependencyFailedException>

There was an issue with a dependency. Check the resource configurations
and retry the request.


=head2 InternalServerException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::InternalServerException>

An internal server error occurred. Retry your request.


=head2 OptimizedPromptEvent => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::OptimizedPromptEvent>

An event in which the prompt was optimized.


=head2 ThrottlingException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ThrottlingException>

Your request was throttled because of service-wide limitations.
Resubmit your request later or in a different region. You can also
purchase Provisioned Throughput
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prov-throughput.html)
to increase the rate or number of tokens you can process.


=head2 ValidationException => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ValidationException>

Input validation failed. Check your request parameters and retry the
request.
