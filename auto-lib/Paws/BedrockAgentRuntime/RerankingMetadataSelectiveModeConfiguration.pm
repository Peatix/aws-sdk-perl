=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::RerankingMetadataSelectiveModeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::RerankingMetadataSelectiveModeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldsToExclude => $value, ..., FieldsToInclude => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::RerankingMetadataSelectiveModeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldsToExclude

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for the metadata fields to include or exclude
when considering reranking. If you include the C<fieldsToExclude>
field, the reranker ignores all the metadata fields that you specify.
If you include the C<fieldsToInclude> field, the reranker uses only the
metadata fields that you specify and ignores all others. You can
include only one of these fields.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FieldsToExclude => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::FieldForReranking>]

exclude from consideration when reranking.


=head2 FieldsToInclude => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::FieldForReranking>]

An array of objects, each of which specifies a metadata field to
include in consideration when reranking. The remaining metadata fields
are ignored.
