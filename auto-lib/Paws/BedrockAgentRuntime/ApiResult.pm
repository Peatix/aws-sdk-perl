=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ApiResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ApiResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionGroup => $value, ..., ResponseState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ApiResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionGroup

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the API operation that was called from the
action group and the response body that was returned.

This data type is used in the following API operations:

=over

=item *

In the C<returnControlInvocationResults> of the InvokeAgent request
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_InvokeAgent.html#API_agent-runtime_InvokeAgent_RequestSyntax)

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActionGroup => Str

The action group that the API operation belongs to.


=head2 AgentId => Str

The agent's ID.


=head2 ApiPath => Str

The path to the API operation.


=head2 ConfirmationState => Str

Controls the API operations or functions to invoke based on the user
confirmation.


=head2 HttpMethod => Str

The HTTP method for the API operation.


=head2 HttpStatusCode => Int

http status code from API execution response (for example: 200, 400,
500).


=head2 ResponseBody => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ResponseBody>

The response body from the API operation. The key of the object is the
content type (currently, only C<TEXT> is supported). The response may
be returned directly or from the Lambda function.


=head2 ResponseState => Str

Controls the final response state returned to end user when
API/Function execution failed. When this state is FAILURE, the request
would fail with dependency failure exception. When this state is
REPROMPT, the API/function response will be sent to model for re-prompt
