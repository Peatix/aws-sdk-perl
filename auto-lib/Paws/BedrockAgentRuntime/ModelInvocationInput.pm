=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ModelInvocationInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ModelInvocationInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FoundationModel => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ModelInvocationInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FoundationModel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input for the pre-processing step.

=over

=item *

The C<type> matches the agent step.

=item *

The C<text> contains the prompt.

=item *

The C<inferenceConfiguration>, C<parserMode>, and C<overrideLambda>
values are set in the PromptOverrideConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_PromptOverrideConfiguration.html)
object that was set when the agent was created or updated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FoundationModel => Str

The identifier of a foundation model.


=head2 InferenceConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::InferenceConfiguration>

Specifications about the inference parameters that were provided
alongside the prompt. These are specified in the
PromptOverrideConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_PromptOverrideConfiguration.html)
object that was set when the agent was created or updated. For more
information, see Inference parameters for foundation models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).


=head2 OverrideLambda => Str

The ARN of the Lambda function to use when parsing the raw foundation
model output in parts of the agent sequence.


=head2 ParserMode => Str

Specifies whether to override the default parser Lambda function when
parsing the raw foundation model output in the part of the agent
sequence defined by the C<promptType>.


=head2 PromptCreationMode => Str

Specifies whether the default prompt template was C<OVERRIDDEN>. If it
was, the C<basePromptTemplate> that was set in the
PromptOverrideConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent_PromptOverrideConfiguration.html)
object when the agent was created or updated is used instead.


=head2 Text => Str

The text that prompted the agent at this step.


=head2 TraceId => Str

The unique identifier of the trace.


=head2 Type => Str

The step in the agent sequence.
