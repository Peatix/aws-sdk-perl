=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Collaborator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Collaborator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionGroups => $value, ..., PromptOverrideConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::Collaborator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionGroups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

List of inline collaborators.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActionGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::AgentActionGroup>]

List of action groups with each action group defining tasks the inline
collaborator agent needs to carry out.


=head2 AgentCollaboration => Str

Defines how the inline supervisor agent handles information across
multiple collaborator agents to coordinate a final response.


=head2 AgentName => Str

Name of the inline collaborator agent which must be the same name as
specified for C<collaboratorName>.


=head2 CollaboratorConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::CollaboratorConfiguration>]

Settings of the collaborator agent.


=head2 CustomerEncryptionKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key that encrypts the
inline collaborator.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FoundationModel => Str

The foundation model used by the inline collaborator agent.


=head2 GuardrailConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::GuardrailConfigurationWithArn>

Details of the guardwrail associated with the inline collaborator.


=head2 IdleSessionTTLInSeconds => Int

The number of seconds for which the Amazon Bedrock keeps information
about the user's conversation with the inline collaborator agent.

A user interaction remains active for the amount of time specified. If
no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and Amazon
Bedrock deletes any data provided before the timeout.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Instruction => Str

Instruction that tell the inline collaborator agent what it should do
and how it should interact with users.


=head2 KnowledgeBases => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::KnowledgeBase>]

Knowledge base associated with the inline collaborator agent.


=head2 PromptOverrideConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::PromptOverrideConfiguration>

Contains configurations to override prompt templates in different parts
of an inline collaborator sequence. For more information, see Advanced
prompts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/advanced-prompts.html).
