=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::KnowledgeBaseVectorSearchConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::KnowledgeBaseVectorSearchConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filter => $value, ..., RerankingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::KnowledgeBaseVectorSearchConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configurations for how to perform the search query and return results.
For more information, see Query configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html).

This data type is used in the following API operations:

=over

=item *

Retrieve request
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_Retrieve.html#API_agent-runtime_Retrieve_RequestSyntax)
E<ndash> in the C<vectorSearchConfiguration> field

=item *

RetrieveAndGenerate request
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_RetrieveAndGenerate.html#API_agent-runtime_RetrieveAndGenerate_RequestSyntax)
E<ndash> in the C<vectorSearchConfiguration> field

=back


=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::RetrievalFilter>

Specifies the filters to use on the metadata in the knowledge base data
sources before returning results. For more information, see Query
configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-test-config.html).


=head2 ImplicitFilterConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::ImplicitFilterConfiguration>

Settings for implicit filtering.


=head2 NumberOfResults => Int

The number of source chunks to retrieve.


=head2 OverrideSearchType => Str

By default, Amazon Bedrock decides a search strategy for you. If you're
using an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store that contains a
filterable text field, you can specify whether to query the knowledge
base with a C<HYBRID> search using both vector embeddings and raw text,
or C<SEMANTIC> search using only vector embeddings. For other vector
store configurations, only C<SEMANTIC> search is available. For more
information, see Test a knowledge base
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-test.html).


=head2 RerankingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgentRuntime::VectorSearchRerankingConfiguration>

Contains configurations for reranking the retrieved results. For more
information, see Improve the relevance of query responses with a
reranker model
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/rerank.html).
