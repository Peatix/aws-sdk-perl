=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::LustreFileSystemConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::LustreFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::LustreFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutomaticBackupRetentionDays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int




=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A boolean flag indicating whether tags on the file system are copied to
backups. If it's set to true, all tags on the file system are copied to
all automatic backups and any user-initiated backups where the user
doesn't specify any tags. If this value is true, and you specify one or
more tags, only the specified tags are copied to backups. If you
specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated backup, no tags
are copied from the file system, regardless of this value. (Default =
false)


=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 DataCompressionType => Str

The data compression configuration for the file system.
C<DataCompressionType> can have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - Data compression is turned off for the file system.

=item *

C<LZ4> - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

=back

For more information, see Lustre data compression
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html).


=head2 DataRepositoryConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::DataRepositoryConfiguration>




=head2 DeploymentType => Str

The deployment type of the FSx for Lustre file system. I<Scratch
deployment type> is designed for temporary storage and shorter-term
processing of data.

C<SCRATCH_1> and C<SCRATCH_2> deployment types are best suited for when
you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The
C<SCRATCH_2> deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and
higher burst throughput capacity than C<SCRATCH_1>.

The C<PERSISTENT_1> and C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type is used for
longer-term storage and workloads and encryption of data in transit.
C<PERSISTENT_2> offers higher C<PerUnitStorageThroughput> (up to 1000
MB/s/TiB) along with a lower minimum storage capacity requirement (600
GiB). To learn more about FSx for Lustre deployment types, see FSx for
Lustre deployment options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/lustre-deployment-types.html).

The default is C<SCRATCH_1>.


=head2 DriveCacheType => Str

The type of drive cache used by C<PERSISTENT_1> file systems that are
provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when
C<StorageType> is HDD. When set to C<READ> the file system has an SSD
storage cache that is sized to 20% of the file system's storage
capacity. This improves the performance for frequently accessed files
by caching up to 20% of the total storage capacity.

This parameter is required when C<StorageType> is set to HDD.


=head2 EfaEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) and GPUDirect Storage
(GDS) support is enabled for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreLogConfiguration>

The Lustre logging configuration. Lustre logging writes the enabled log
events for your file system to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 MetadataConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::FileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration>

The Lustre metadata performance configuration for an Amazon FSx for
Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type.


=head2 MountName => Str

You use the C<MountName> value when mounting the file system.

For the C<SCRATCH_1> deployment type, this value is always "C<fsx>".
For C<SCRATCH_2>, C<PERSISTENT_1>, and C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment
types, this value is a string that is unique within an Amazon Web
Services Region.


=head2 PerUnitStorageThroughput => Int

Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per second of read
or write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. File system
throughput capacity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) *
PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). This option is only valid for
C<PERSISTENT_1> and C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment types.

Valid values:

=over

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_1> SSD storage: 50, 100, 200.

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_1> HDD storage: 12, 40.

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_2> SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000.

=back



=head2 RootSquashConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreRootSquashConfiguration>

The Lustre root squash configuration for an Amazon FSx for Lustre file
system. When enabled, root squash restricts root-level access from
clients that try to access your file system as a root user.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str

The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance, formatted
d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. Here, C<d> is the weekday number, from 1
through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.
