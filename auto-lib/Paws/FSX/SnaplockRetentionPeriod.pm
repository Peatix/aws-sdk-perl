=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::SnaplockRetentionPeriod

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::SnaplockRetentionPeriod object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefaultRetention => $value, ..., MinimumRetention => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::SnaplockRetentionPeriod object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefaultRetention

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration to set the retention period of an FSx for ONTAP
SnapLock volume. The retention period includes default, maximum, and

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultRetention => L<Paws::FSX::RetentionPeriod>

The retention period assigned to a write once, read many (WORM) file by
default if an explicit retention period is not set for an FSx for ONTAP
SnapLock volume. The default retention period must be greater than or
equal to the minimum retention period and less than or equal to the
maximum retention period.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaximumRetention => L<Paws::FSX::RetentionPeriod>

The longest retention period that can be assigned to a WORM file on an
FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinimumRetention => L<Paws::FSX::RetentionPeriod>

The shortest retention period that can be assigned to a WORM file on an
FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.
