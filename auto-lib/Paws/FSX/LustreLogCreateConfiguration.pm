=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::LustreLogCreateConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Level => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::LustreLogCreateConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Lustre logging configuration used when creating or updating an
Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. An Amazon File Cache is created with
Lustre logging enabled by default, with a setting of C<WARN_ERROR> for
the logging events. which can't be changed.

Lustre logging writes the enabled logging events for your file system
or cache to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

Services partition, Amazon Web Services Region, and Amazon Web Services
account as your Amazon FSx file system.

=item *

The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the
C</aws/fsx> prefix.

If you do not provide a destination, Amazon FSx will create and use a
log stream in the CloudWatch Logs C</aws/fsx/lustre> log group (for
Amazon FSx for Lustre) or C</aws/fsx/filecache> (for Amazon File
Cache).

If C<Destination> is provided and the resource does not exist, the

If C<Level> is set to C<DISABLED>, you cannot specify a destination in
C<Destination>.
