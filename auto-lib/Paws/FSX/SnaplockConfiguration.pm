=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::SnaplockConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::SnaplockConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuditLogVolume => $value, ..., VolumeAppendModeEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::SnaplockConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuditLogVolume

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the SnapLock configuration for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
volume.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuditLogVolume => Bool

Enables or disables the audit log volume for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
volume. The default value is C<false>. If you set C<AuditLogVolume> to
C<true>, the SnapLock volume is created as an audit log volume. The
minimum retention period for an audit log volume is six months.

For more information, see SnapLock audit log volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/how-snaplock-works.html#snaplock-audit-log-volume).


=head2 AutocommitPeriod => L<Paws::FSX::AutocommitPeriod>

The configuration object for setting the autocommit period of files in
an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 PrivilegedDelete => Str

Enables, disables, or permanently disables privileged delete on an FSx
for ONTAP SnapLock Enterprise volume. Enabling privileged delete allows
SnapLock administrators to delete write once, read many (WORM) files
even if they have active retention periods. C<PERMANENTLY_DISABLED> is
a terminal state. If privileged delete is permanently disabled on a
SnapLock volume, you can't re-enable it. The default value is
C<DISABLED>.

For more information, see Privileged delete
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snaplock-enterprise.html#privileged-delete).


=head2 RetentionPeriod => L<Paws::FSX::SnaplockRetentionPeriod>

Specifies the retention period of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 SnaplockType => Str

Specifies the retention mode of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume. After
it is set, it can't be changed. You can choose one of the following
retention modes:

=over

=item *

C<COMPLIANCE>: Files transitioned to write once, read many (WORM) on a
Compliance volume can't be deleted until their retention periods
expire. This retention mode is used to address government or
industry-specific mandates or to protect against ransomware attacks.
For more information, see SnapLock Compliance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snaplock-compliance.html).

=item *

C<ENTERPRISE>: Files transitioned to WORM on an Enterprise volume can
be deleted by authorized users before their retention periods expire
using privileged delete. This retention mode is used to advance an
organization's data integrity and internal compliance or to test
retention settings before using SnapLock Compliance. For more
information, see SnapLock Enterprise
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snaplock-enterprise.html).

=back



=head2 VolumeAppendModeEnabled => Bool

Enables or disables volume-append mode on an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
volume. Volume-append mode allows you to create WORM-appendable files
and write data to them incrementally. The default value is C<false>.

For more information, see Volume-append mode
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/worm-state.html#worm-state-append).
