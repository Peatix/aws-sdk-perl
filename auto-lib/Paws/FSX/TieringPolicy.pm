=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CoolingPeriod => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CoolingPeriod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the data tiering policy for an ONTAP volume. When enabled,
Amazon FSx for ONTAP's intelligent tiering automatically transitions a
volume's data between the file system's primary storage and capacity
pool storage based on your access patterns.

Valid tiering policies are the following:

=over

=item *

C<SNAPSHOT_ONLY> - (Default value) moves cold snapshots to the capacity
pool storage tier.

=back

=over

=item *

C<AUTO> - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool
storage tier based on your access patterns.

=back

=over

=item *

C<ALL> - moves all user data blocks in both the active file system and
Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

=back

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier, preventing
it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.

=back


=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CoolingPeriod => Int

Specifies the number of days that user data in a volume must remain
inactive before it is considered "cold" and moved to the capacity pool.
Used with the C<AUTO> and C<SNAPSHOT_ONLY> tiering policies. Enter a
whole number between 2 and 183. Default values are 31 days for C<AUTO>
and 2 days for C<SNAPSHOT_ONLY>.


=head2 Name => Str

Specifies the tiering policy used to transition data. Default value is
C<SNAPSHOT_ONLY>.

=over

=item *

C<SNAPSHOT_ONLY> - moves cold snapshots to the capacity pool storage
tier.

=item *

C<AUTO> - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool
storage tier based on your access patterns.

=item *

C<ALL> - moves all user data blocks in both the active file system and
Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.

=item *

C<NONE> - keeps a volume's data in the primary storage tier, preventing
it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.
