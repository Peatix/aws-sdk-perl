=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CreateOpenZFSVolumeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateOpenZFSVolumeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CopyTagsToSnapshots => $value, ..., UserAndGroupQuotas => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateOpenZFSVolumeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CopyTagsToSnapshots

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration of the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS volume that
you are creating.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyTagsToSnapshots => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should be copied
to snapshots. This value defaults to C<false>. If it's set to C<true>,
all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots where the user doesn't
specify tags. If this value is C<true>, and you specify one or more
tags, only the specified tags are copied to snapshots. If you specify
one or more tags when creating the snapshot, no tags are copied from
the volume, regardless of this value.


=head2 DataCompressionType => Str

Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume. The
compression type is C<NONE> by default.

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. C<NONE> is the
default.

=item *

C<ZSTD> - Compresses the data in the volume using the Zstandard (ZSTD)
compression algorithm. ZSTD compression provides a higher level of data
compression and higher read throughput performance than LZ4
compression.

=item *

C<LZ4> - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4 compression
algorithm. LZ4 compression provides a lower level of compression and
higher write throughput performance than ZSTD compression.

of your Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system, see Tips for maximizing
performance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/performance.html#performance-tips-zfs)
File system and volume settings in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User
Guide>.


=head2 NfsExports => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSNfsExport>]

The configuration object for mounting a Network File System (NFS) file
system.


=head2 OriginSnapshot => L<Paws::FSX::CreateOpenZFSOriginSnapshotConfiguration>

The configuration object that specifies the snapshot to use as the
origin of the data for the volume.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ParentVolumeId => Str

The ID of the volume to use as the parent volume of the volume that you
are creating.


=head2 ReadOnly => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether the volume is read-only.


=head2 RecordSizeKiB => Int

Specifies the suggested block size for a volume in a ZFS dataset, in
kibibytes (KiB). For file systems using the Intelligent-Tiering storage
class, valid values are 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 KiB, with a
default of 1024 KiB. For all other file systems, valid values are 4, 8,
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB, with a default of 128 KiB. We
recommend using the default setting for the majority of use cases.
Generally, workloads that write in fixed small or large record sizes
may benefit from setting a custom record size, like database workloads
(small record size) or media streaming workloads (large record size).
For additional guidance on when to set a custom record size, see ZFS
Record size
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/performance.html#record-size-performance)
in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide>.


=head2 StorageCapacityQuotaGiB => Int

Sets the maximum storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for the volume. You
can specify a quota that is larger than the storage on the parent
volume. A volume quota limits the amount of storage that the volume can
consume to the configured amount, but does not guarantee the space will
be available on the parent volume. To guarantee quota space, you must
also set C<StorageCapacityReservationGiB>. To I<not> specify a storage
capacity quota, set this to C<-1>.

For more information, see Volume properties
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/managing-volumes.html#volume-properties)
in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide>.


=head2 StorageCapacityReservationGiB => Int

Specifies the amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to reserve from the
parent volume. Setting C<StorageCapacityReservationGiB> guarantees that
the specified amount of storage space on the parent volume will always
be available for the volume. You can't reserve more storage than the
parent volume has. To I<not> specify a storage capacity reservation,
set this to C<0> or C<-1>. For more information, see Volume properties
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/managing-volumes.html#volume-properties)
in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide>.


=head2 UserAndGroupQuotas => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSUserOrGroupQuota>]

Configures how much storage users and groups can use on the volume.
