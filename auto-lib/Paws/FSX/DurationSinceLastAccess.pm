=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::DurationSinceLastAccess

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::DurationSinceLastAccess object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Unit => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::DurationSinceLastAccess object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Unit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the minimum amount of time since last access for a file to be
eligible for release. Only files that have been exported to S3 and that
were last accessed or modified before this point-in-time are eligible
to be released from the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit of time used by the C<Value> parameter to determine if a file
can be released, based on when it was last accessed. C<DAYS> is the
only supported value. This is a required parameter.


=head2 Value => Int

An integer that represents the minimum amount of time (in days) since a
file was last accessed in the file system. Only exported files with a
C<MAX(atime, ctime, mtime)> timestamp that is more than this amount of
time in the past (relative to the task create time) will be released.
The default of C<Value> is C<0>. This is a required parameter.

If an exported file meets the last accessed time criteria, its file or
directory path must also be specified in the C<Paths> parameter of the
operation in order for the file to be released.
