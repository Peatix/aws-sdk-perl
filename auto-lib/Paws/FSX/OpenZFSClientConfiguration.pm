=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::OpenZFSClientConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::OpenZFSClientConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Clients => $value, ..., Options => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::OpenZFSClientConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Clients

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies who can mount an OpenZFS file system and the options
available while mounting the file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Clients => Str

A value that specifies who can mount the file system. You can provide a
wildcard character (C<*>), an IP address (C<0.0.0.0>), or a CIDR
address (C<192.0.2.0/24>). By default, Amazon FSx uses the wildcard
character when specifying the client.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Options => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The options to use when mounting the file system. For a list of options
that you can use with Network File System (NFS), see the exports(5) -
Linux man page (https://linux.die.net/man/5/exports). When choosing
your options, consider the following:

=over

=item *

C<crossmnt> is used by default. If you don't specify C<crossmnt> when
changing the client configuration, you won't be able to see or access
snapshots in your file system's snapshot directory.

=item *

C<sync> is used by default. If you instead specify C<async>, the system
acknowledges writes before writing to disk. If the system crashes
before the writes are finished, you lose the unwritten data.
