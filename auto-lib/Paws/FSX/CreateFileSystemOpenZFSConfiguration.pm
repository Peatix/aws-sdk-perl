=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutomaticBackupRetentionDays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Amazon FSx for OpenZFS configuration properties for the file system
that you are creating.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int




=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the file system should be
copied to backups. This value defaults to C<false>. If it's set to
C<true>, all tags for the file system are copied to all automatic and
user-initiated backups where the user doesn't specify tags. If this
value is C<true>, and you specify one or more tags, only the specified
tags are copied to backups. If you specify one or more tags when
creating a user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file
system, regardless of this value.


=head2 CopyTagsToVolumes => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the file system should be
copied to volumes. This value defaults to C<false>. If it's set to
C<true>, all tags for the file system are copied to volumes where the
user doesn't specify tags. If this value is C<true>, and you specify
one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to volumes. If you
specify one or more tags when creating the volume, no tags are copied
from the file system, regardless of this value.


=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentType => Str

Specifies the file system deployment type. Valid values are the
following:

=over

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_1>- Creates file systems with high availability and
durability by replicating your data and supporting failover across
multiple Availability Zones in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_HA_2>- Creates file systems with high availability and
throughput capacities of 160 - 10,240 MB/s using an NVMe L2ARC cache by
deploying a primary and standby file system within the same
Availability Zone.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_HA_1>- Creates file systems with high availability and
throughput capacities of 64 - 4,096 MB/s by deploying a primary and
standby file system within the same Availability Zone.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_2>- Creates file systems with throughput capacities of 160
- 10,240 MB/s using an NVMe L2ARC cache that automatically recover
within a single Availability Zone.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_1>- Creates file systems with throughput capacities of 64 -
4,096 MBs that automatically recover within a single Availability Zone.

For a list of which Amazon Web Services Regions each deployment type is
available in, see Deployment type availability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/availability-durability.html#available-aws-regions).
For more information on the differences in performance between
deployment types, see File system performance

in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide>.


=head2 DiskIopsConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration>




=head2 EndpointIpAddressRange => Str

(Multi-AZ only) Specifies the IP address range in which the endpoints
to access your file system will be created. By default in the Amazon
FSx API and Amazon FSx console, Amazon FSx selects an available /28 IP
address range for you from one of the VPC's CIDR ranges. You can have
overlapping endpoint IP addresses for file systems deployed in the same
VPC/route tables.


=head2 PreferredSubnetId => Str

Required when C<DeploymentType> is set to C<MULTI_AZ_1>. This specifies
the subnet in which you want the preferred file server to be located.


=head2 ReadCacheConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSReadCacheConfiguration>

Specifies the optional provisioned SSD read cache on file systems that
use the Intelligent-Tiering storage class.


=head2 RootVolumeConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSCreateRootVolumeConfiguration>

The configuration Amazon FSx uses when creating the root value of the
Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system. All volumes are children of the
root volume.


=head2 RouteTableIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

(Multi-AZ only) Specifies the route tables in which Amazon FSx creates
the rules for routing traffic to the correct file server. You should
specify all virtual private cloud (VPC) route tables associated with
the subnets in which your clients are located. By default, Amazon FSx
selects your VPC's default route table.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ThroughputCapacity => Int

Specifies the throughput of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system,
measured in megabytes per second (MBps). Valid values depend on the
DeploymentType you choose, as follows:

=over

=item *

For C<MULTI_AZ_1> and C<SINGLE_AZ_2>, valid values are 160, 320, 640,
1280, 2560, 3840, 5120, 7680, or 10240 MBps.

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1>, valid values are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048,
3072, or 4096 MBps.

=back

You pay for additional throughput capacity that you provision.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str
