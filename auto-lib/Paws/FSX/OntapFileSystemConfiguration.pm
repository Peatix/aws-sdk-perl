=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::OntapFileSystemConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::OntapFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::OntapFileSystemConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutomaticBackupRetentionDays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for the FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int




=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 DeploymentType => Str

Specifies the FSx for ONTAP file system deployment type in use in the
file system.

=over

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_1> - A high availability file system configured for Multi-AZ
redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability.
This is a first-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_2> - A high availability file system configured for Multi-AZ
redundancy to tolerate temporary AZ unavailability. This is a
second-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_1> - A file system configured for Single-AZ redundancy.
This is a first-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_2> - A file system configured with multiple
high-availability (HA) pairs for Single-AZ redundancy. This is a
second-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=back

For information about the use cases for Multi-AZ and Single-AZ
deployments, refer to Choosing Multi-AZ or Single-AZ file system
deployment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/high-availability-multiAZ.html).


=head2 DiskIopsConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration>

The SSD IOPS configuration for the ONTAP file system, specifying the
number of provisioned IOPS and the provision mode.


=head2 EndpointIpAddressRange => Str

(Multi-AZ only) Specifies the IP address range in which the endpoints
to access your file system will be created. By default in the Amazon
FSx API, Amazon FSx selects an unused IP address range for you from the
198.19.* range. By default in the Amazon FSx console, Amazon FSx
chooses the last 64 IP addresses from the VPCE<rsquo>s primary CIDR
range to use as the endpoint IP address range for the file system. You
can have overlapping endpoint IP addresses for file systems deployed in
the same VPC/route tables.


=head2 Endpoints => L<Paws::FSX::FileSystemEndpoints>

The C<Management> and C<Intercluster> endpoints that are used to access
data or to manage the file system using the NetApp ONTAP CLI, REST API,
or NetApp SnapMirror.


=head2 FsxAdminPassword => Str

You can use the C<fsxadmin> user account to access the NetApp ONTAP CLI
and REST API. The password value is always redacted in the response.


=head2 HAPairs => Int

Specifies how many high-availability (HA) file server pairs the file
system will have. The default value is 1. The value of this property
affects the values of C<StorageCapacity>, C<Iops>, and
C<ThroughputCapacity>. For more information, see High-availability (HA)
pairs (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/HA-pairs.html)
in the FSx for ONTAP user guide.

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<HAPairs> is less than 1 or greater than 12.

=item *

The value of C<HAPairs> is greater than 1 and the value of
C<DeploymentType> is C<SINGLE_AZ_1>, C<MULTI_AZ_1>, or C<MULTI_AZ_2>.

=back



=head2 PreferredSubnetId => Str




=head2 RouteTableIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

(Multi-AZ only) The VPC route tables in which your file system's
endpoints are created.


=head2 ThroughputCapacity => Int




=head2 ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair => Int

Use to choose the throughput capacity per HA pair. When the value of
C<HAPairs> is equal to 1, the value of C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
is the total throughput for the file system.

This field and C<ThroughputCapacity> cannot be defined in the same API
call, but one is required.

This field and C<ThroughputCapacity> are the same for file systems with
one HA pair.

=over

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1> and C<MULTI_AZ_1> file systems, valid values are
128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 MBps.

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_2>, valid values are 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=item *

For C<MULTI_AZ_2>, valid values are 384, 768, 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=back

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> and C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
are not the same value.

=item *

The value of deployment type is C<SINGLE_AZ_2> and
C<ThroughputCapacity> / C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid
HA pair (a value between 1 and 12).

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid value.
