This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::AutoImportPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Events => $value, ..., Events => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::AutoImportPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Events

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the data repository association's automatic import policy.
The AutoImportPolicy defines how Amazon FSx keeps your file metadata
and directory listings up to date by importing changes to your Amazon
FSx for Lustre file system as you modify objects in a linked S3 bucket.

The C<AutoImportPolicy> is only supported on Amazon FSx for Lustre file
systems with a data repository association.

the data repository.
