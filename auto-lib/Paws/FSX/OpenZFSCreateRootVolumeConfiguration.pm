=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::OpenZFSCreateRootVolumeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::OpenZFSCreateRootVolumeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CopyTagsToSnapshots => $value, ..., UserAndGroupQuotas => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::OpenZFSCreateRootVolumeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CopyTagsToSnapshots

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS root volume.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyTagsToSnapshots => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether tags for the volume should be copied
to snapshots of the volume. This value defaults to C<false>. If it's
set to C<true>, all tags for the volume are copied to snapshots where
the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is C<true> and you specify
one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to snapshots. If
you specify one or more tags when creating the snapshot, no tags are
copied from the volume, regardless of this value.


=head2 DataCompressionType => Str

Specifies the method used to compress the data on the volume. The
compression type is C<NONE> by default.

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - Doesn't compress the data on the volume. C<NONE> is the
default.

=item *

C<ZSTD> - Compresses the data in the volume using the Zstandard (ZSTD)
compression algorithm. Compared to LZ4, Z-Standard provides a better
compression ratio to minimize on-disk storage utilization.

=item *

C<LZ4> - Compresses the data in the volume using the LZ4 compression
algorithm. Compared to Z-Standard, LZ4 is less compute-intensive and
delivers higher write throughput speeds.

=back



=head2 NfsExports => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSNfsExport>]

The configuration object for mounting a file system.


=head2 ReadOnly => Bool

A Boolean value indicating whether the volume is read-only. Setting
this value to C<true> can be useful after you have completed changes to
a volume and no longer want changes to occur.


=head2 RecordSizeKiB => Int

Specifies the record size of an OpenZFS root volume, in kibibytes
(KiB). Valid values are 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, or 1024 KiB.
The default is 128 KiB. Most workloads should use the default record
size. Database workflows can benefit from a smaller record size, while
streaming workflows can benefit from a larger record size. For
additional guidance on setting a custom record size, see Tips for
maximizing performance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/performance.html#performance-tips-zfs)
in the I<Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide>.


=head2 UserAndGroupQuotas => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::OpenZFSUserOrGroupQuota>]

An object specifying how much storage users or groups can use on the
volume.
