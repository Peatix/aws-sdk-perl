=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CopyBackup - Arguments for method CopyBackup on L<Paws::FSX>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CopyBackup on the
L<Amazon FSx|Paws::FSX> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CopyBackup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CopyBackup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $fsx = Paws->service('FSX');
    # To copy a backup
    # This operation copies an Amazon FSx backup.
    my $CopyBackupResponse = $fsx->CopyBackup(
      'SourceBackupId' => 'backup-03e3c82e0183b7b6b',
      'SourceRegion'   => 'us-east-2'
    );

    # Results:
    my $Backup = $CopyBackupResponse->Backup;

    # Returns a L<Paws::FSX::CopyBackupResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/fsx/CopyBackup>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientRequestToken => Str





=head2 CopyTags => Bool

A Boolean flag indicating whether tags from the source backup should be
copied to the backup copy. This value defaults to C<false>.

If you set C<CopyTags> to C<true> and the source backup has existing
tags, you can use the C<Tags> parameter to create new tags, provided
that the sum of the source backup tags and the new tags doesn't exceed
50. Both sets of tags are merged. If there are tag conflicts (for
example, two tags with the same key but different values), the tags
created with the C<Tags> parameter take precedence.



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str





=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceBackupId => Str

The ID of the source backup. Specifies the ID of the backup that's
being copied.



=head2 SourceRegion => Str

The source Amazon Web Services Region of the backup. Specifies the
Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup is being copied. The
source and destination Regions must be in the same Amazon Web Services
partition. If you don't specify a Region, C<SourceRegion> defaults to
the Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::Tag>]






=head1 SEE ALSO
