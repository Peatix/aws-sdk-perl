=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::AutoExportPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Events => $value, ..., Events => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::AutoExportPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Events

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a data repository association's automatic export policy. The
C<AutoExportPolicy> defines the types of updated objects on the file
system that will be automatically exported to the data repository. As
you create, modify, or delete files, Amazon FSx for Lustre
automatically exports the defined changes asynchronously once your
application finishes modifying the file.

The C<AutoExportPolicy> is only supported on Amazon FSx for Lustre file
systems with a data repository association.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

C<CHANGED> - Changes to files and directories on the file system are
automatically exported to the data repository.

=item *

C<DELETED> - Files and directories are automatically deleted on the
data repository when they are deleted on the file system.
