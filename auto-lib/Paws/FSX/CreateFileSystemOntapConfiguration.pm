=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOntapConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOntapConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemOntapConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutomaticBackupRetentionDays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ONTAP configuration properties of the FSx for ONTAP file system
that you are creating.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int




=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentType => Str

Specifies the FSx for ONTAP file system deployment type to use in
creating the file system.

=over

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_1> - A high availability file system configured for Multi-AZ
redundancy to tolerate temporary Availability Zone (AZ) unavailability.
This is a first-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<MULTI_AZ_2> - A high availability file system configured for Multi-AZ
redundancy to tolerate temporary AZ unavailability. This is a
second-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_1> - A file system configured for Single-AZ redundancy.
This is a first-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=item *

C<SINGLE_AZ_2> - A file system configured with multiple
high-availability (HA) pairs for Single-AZ redundancy. This is a
second-generation FSx for ONTAP file system.

=back

For information about the use cases for Multi-AZ and Single-AZ
deployments, refer to Choosing a file system deployment type
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/high-availability-AZ.html).


=head2 DiskIopsConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration>

The SSD IOPS configuration for the FSx for ONTAP file system.


=head2 EndpointIpAddressRange => Str

(Multi-AZ only) Specifies the IP address range in which the endpoints
to access your file system will be created. By default in the Amazon
FSx API, Amazon FSx selects an unused IP address range for you from the
198.19.* range. By default in the Amazon FSx console, Amazon FSx
chooses the last 64 IP addresses from the VPCE<rsquo>s primary CIDR
range to use as the endpoint IP address range for the file system. You
can have overlapping endpoint IP addresses for file systems deployed in
the same VPC/route tables, as long as they don't overlap with any
subnet.


=head2 FsxAdminPassword => Str

The ONTAP administrative password for the C<fsxadmin> user with which
you administer your file system using the NetApp ONTAP CLI and REST
API.


=head2 HAPairs => Int

Specifies how many high-availability (HA) pairs of file servers will
power your file system. First-generation file systems are powered by 1
HA pair. Second-generation multi-AZ file systems are powered by 1 HA
pair. Second generation single-AZ file systems are powered by up to 12
HA pairs. The default value is 1. The value of this property affects
the values of C<StorageCapacity>, C<Iops>, and C<ThroughputCapacity>.
For more information, see High-availability (HA) pairs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/administering-file-systems.html#HA-pairs)
in the FSx for ONTAP user guide. Block storage protocol support (iSCSI
and NVMe over TCP) is disabled on file systems with more than 6 HA
pairs. For more information, see Using block storage protocols
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html#using-block-storage).

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<HAPairs> is less than 1 or greater than 12.

=item *

The value of C<HAPairs> is greater than 1 and the value of
C<DeploymentType> is C<SINGLE_AZ_1>, C<MULTI_AZ_1>, or C<MULTI_AZ_2>.

=back



=head2 PreferredSubnetId => Str

Required when C<DeploymentType> is set to C<MULTI_AZ_1> or
C<MULTI_AZ_2>. This specifies the subnet in which you want the
preferred file server to be located.


=head2 RouteTableIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

(Multi-AZ only) Specifies the route tables in which Amazon FSx creates
the rules for routing traffic to the correct file server. You should
specify all virtual private cloud (VPC) route tables associated with
the subnets in which your clients are located. By default, Amazon FSx
selects your VPC's default route table.

Amazon FSx manages these route tables for Multi-AZ file systems using
tag-based authentication. These route tables are tagged with C<Key:
AmazonFSx; Value: ManagedByAmazonFSx>. When creating FSx for ONTAP
Multi-AZ file systems using CloudFormation we recommend that you add
the C<Key: AmazonFSx; Value: ManagedByAmazonFSx> tag manually.


=head2 ThroughputCapacity => Int

Sets the throughput capacity for the file system that you're creating
in megabytes per second (MBps). For more information, see Managing
throughput capacity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-throughput-capacity.html)
in the FSx for ONTAP User Guide.

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> and C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
are not the same value.

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> when divided by the value of
C<HAPairs> is outside of the valid range for C<ThroughputCapacity>.

=back



=head2 ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair => Int

Use to choose the throughput capacity per HA pair, rather than the
total throughput for the file system.

You can define either the C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> or the
C<ThroughputCapacity> when creating a file system, but not both.

This field and C<ThroughputCapacity> are the same for file systems
powered by one HA pair.

=over

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1> and C<MULTI_AZ_1> file systems, valid values are
128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 MBps.

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_2>, valid values are 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=item *

For C<MULTI_AZ_2>, valid values are 384, 768, 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=back

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> and C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
are not the same value for file systems with one HA pair.

=item *

The value of deployment type is C<SINGLE_AZ_2> and
C<ThroughputCapacity> / C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid
HA pair (a value between 1 and 12).

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid value.

=back



=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str
