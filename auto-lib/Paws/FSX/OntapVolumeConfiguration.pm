=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::OntapVolumeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::OntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregateConfiguration => $value, ..., VolumeStyle => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::OntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregateConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggregateConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::AggregateConfiguration>

This structure specifies configuration options for a volumeE<rsquo>s
storage aggregate or aggregates.


=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume should be copied
to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags
for the volume are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups
where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is true, and you
specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to
backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated
backup, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this value.


=head2 FlexCacheEndpointType => Str

Specifies the FlexCache endpoint type of the volume. Valid values are
the following:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> specifies that the volume doesn't have a FlexCache
configuration. C<NONE> is the default.

=item *

C<ORIGIN> specifies that the volume is the origin volume for a
FlexCache volume.

=item *

C<CACHE> specifies that the volume is a FlexCache volume.

=back



=head2 JunctionPath => Str

Specifies the directory that network-attached storage (NAS) clients use
to mount the volume, along with the storage virtual machine (SVM)
Domain Name System (DNS) name or IP address. You can create a
C<JunctionPath> directly below a parent volume junction or on a
directory within a volume. A C<JunctionPath> for a volume named C<vol3>
might be C</vol1/vol2/vol3>, or C</vol1/dir2/vol3>, or even
C</dir1/dir2/vol3>.


=head2 OntapVolumeType => Str

Specifies the type of volume. Valid values are the following:

=over

=item *

C<RW> specifies a read/write volume. C<RW> is the default.

=item *

C<DP> specifies a data-protection volume. You can protect data by
replicating it to data-protection mirror copies. If a disaster occurs,
you can use these data-protection mirror copies to recover data.

=item *

C<LS> specifies a load-sharing mirror volume. A load-sharing mirror
reduces the network traffic to a FlexVol volume by providing additional
read-only access to clients.

=back



=head2 SecurityStyle => Str

The security style for the volume, which can be C<UNIX>, C<NTFS>, or
C<MIXED>.


=head2 SizeInBytes => Int

The configured size of the volume, in bytes.


=head2 SizeInMegabytes => Int

The configured size of the volume, in megabytes (MBs).


=head2 SnaplockConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::SnaplockConfiguration>

The SnapLock configuration object for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 SnapshotPolicy => Str

Specifies the snapshot policy for the volume. There are three built-in
snapshot policies:

=over

=item *

C<default>: This is the default policy. A maximum of six hourly
snapshots taken five minutes past the hour. A maximum of two daily
snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight. A
maximum of two weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at 15 minutes after
midnight.

=item *

C<default-1weekly>: This policy is the same as the C<default> policy
except that it only retains one snapshot from the weekly schedule.

=item *

C<none>: This policy does not take any snapshots. This policy can be
assigned to volumes to prevent automatic snapshots from being taken.

=back

You can also provide the name of a custom policy that you created with
the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

For more information, see Snapshot policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snapshots-ontap.html#snapshot-policies)
in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.


=head2 StorageEfficiencyEnabled => Bool

The volume's storage efficiency setting.


=head2 StorageVirtualMachineId => Str

The ID of the volume's storage virtual machine.


=head2 StorageVirtualMachineRoot => Bool

A Boolean flag indicating whether this volume is the root volume for
its storage virtual machine (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be the
root volume. This value defaults to C<false>. If this value is C<true>,
then this is the SVM root volume.

This flag is useful when you're deleting an SVM, because you must first
delete all non-root volumes. This flag, when set to C<false>, helps you
identify which volumes to delete before you can delete the SVM.


=head2 TieringPolicy => L<Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy>

The volume's C<TieringPolicy> setting.


=head2 UUID => Str

The volume's universally unique identifier (UUID).


=head2 VolumeStyle => Str

Use to specify the style of an ONTAP volume. For more information about
FlexVols and FlexGroups, see Volume types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/volume-types.html)
in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.
