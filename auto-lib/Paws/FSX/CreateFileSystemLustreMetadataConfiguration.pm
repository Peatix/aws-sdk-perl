=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Iops => $value, ..., Mode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Iops

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Lustre metadata performance configuration for the creation of an
Amazon FSx for Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment
type. The configuration uses a Metadata IOPS value to set the maximum
rate of metadata disk IOPS supported by the file system.

After creation, the file system supports increasing metadata
performance. For more information on Metadata IOPS, see Lustre metadata
performance configuration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-metadata-performance.html#metadata-configuration)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Iops => Int

(USER_PROVISIONED mode only) Specifies the number of Metadata IOPS to
provision for the file system. This parameter sets the maximum rate of
metadata disk IOPS supported by the file system. Valid values are
C<1500>, C<3000>, C<6000>, C<12000>, and multiples of C<12000> up to a
maximum of C<192000>.

Iops doesnE<rsquo>t have a default value. If you're using
USER_PROVISIONED mode, you can choose to specify a valid value. If
you're using AUTOMATIC mode, you cannot specify a value because FSx for
Lustre automatically sets the value based on your file system storage
capacity.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Mode => Str

The metadata configuration mode for provisioning Metadata IOPS for an
FSx for Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type.

=over

=item *

In AUTOMATIC mode, FSx for Lustre automatically provisions and scales
the number of Metadata IOPS for your file system based on your file
system storage capacity.

=item *

In USER_PROVISIONED mode, you specify the number of Metadata IOPS to
provision for your file system.
