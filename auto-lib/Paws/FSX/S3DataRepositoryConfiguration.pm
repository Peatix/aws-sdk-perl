=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::S3DataRepositoryConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::S3DataRepositoryConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoExportPolicy => $value, ..., AutoImportPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::S3DataRepositoryConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoExportPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to an Amazon
FSx for Lustre file system with a data repository association. The
configuration consists of an C<AutoImportPolicy> that defines which
file events on the data repository are automatically imported to the
file system and an C<AutoExportPolicy> that defines which file events
on the file system are automatically exported to the data repository.
File events are when files or directories are added, changed, or
deleted on the file system or the data repository.

Data repository associations on Amazon File Cache don't use
C<S3DataRepositoryConfiguration> because they don't support automatic
import or automatic export.
