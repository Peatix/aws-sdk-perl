=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::ReleaseConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::ReleaseConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DurationSinceLastAccess => $value, ..., DurationSinceLastAccess => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::ReleaseConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DurationSinceLastAccess

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration that specifies a minimum amount of time since last
access for an exported file to be eligible for release from an Amazon
FSx for Lustre file system. Only files that were last accessed before
this point-in-time can be released. For example, if you specify a last
accessed time criteria of 9 days, only files that were last accessed
9.00001 or more days ago can be released.

Only file data that has been exported to S3 can be released. Files that
have not yet been exported to S3, such as new or changed files that
have not been exported, are not eligible for release. When files are
released, their metadata stays on the file system, so they can still be
accessed later. Users and applications can access a released file by
reading the file again, which restores data from Amazon S3 to the FSx
for Lustre file system.

If a file meets the last accessed time criteria, its file or directory
path must also be specified with the C<Paths> parameter of the
operation in order for the file to be released.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DurationSinceLastAccess => L<Paws::FSX::DurationSinceLastAccess>

Defines the point-in-time since an exported file was last accessed, in
order for that file to be eligible for release. Only files that were
last accessed before this point-in-time are eligible to be released
from the file system.
