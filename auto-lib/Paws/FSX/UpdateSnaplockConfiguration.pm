=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::UpdateSnaplockConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::UpdateSnaplockConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuditLogVolume => $value, ..., VolumeAppendModeEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::UpdateSnaplockConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuditLogVolume

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Updates the SnapLock configuration for an existing FSx for ONTAP
volume.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuditLogVolume => Bool

Enables or disables the audit log volume for an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
volume. The default value is C<false>. If you set C<AuditLogVolume> to
C<true>, the SnapLock volume is created as an audit log volume. The
minimum retention period for an audit log volume is six months.

For more information, see SnapLock audit log volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/how-snaplock-works.html#snaplock-audit-log-volume).


=head2 AutocommitPeriod => L<Paws::FSX::AutocommitPeriod>

The configuration object for setting the autocommit period of files in
an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 PrivilegedDelete => Str

Enables, disables, or permanently disables privileged delete on an FSx
for ONTAP SnapLock Enterprise volume. Enabling privileged delete allows
SnapLock administrators to delete write once, read many (WORM) files
even if they have active retention periods. C<PERMANENTLY_DISABLED> is
a terminal state. If privileged delete is permanently disabled on a
SnapLock volume, you can't re-enable it. The default value is
C<DISABLED>.

For more information, see Privileged delete
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snaplock-enterprise.html#privileged-delete).


=head2 RetentionPeriod => L<Paws::FSX::SnaplockRetentionPeriod>

Specifies the retention period of an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 VolumeAppendModeEnabled => Bool

Enables or disables volume-append mode on an FSx for ONTAP SnapLock
volume. Volume-append mode allows you to create WORM-appendable files
and write data to them incrementally. The default value is C<false>.

For more information, see Volume-append mode
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/worm-state.html#worm-state-append).
