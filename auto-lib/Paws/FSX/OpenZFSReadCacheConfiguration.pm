=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::OpenZFSReadCacheConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::OpenZFSReadCacheConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SizeGiB => $value, ..., SizingMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::OpenZFSReadCacheConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SizeGiB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the optional provisioned SSD read cache on file
systems that use the Intelligent-Tiering storage class.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SizeGiB => Int

Required if C<SizingMode> is set to C<USER_PROVISIONED>. Specifies the
size of the file system's SSD read cache, in gibibytes (GiB).


=head2 SizingMode => Str

Specifies how the provisioned SSD read cache is sized, as follows:

=over

=item *

Set to C<NO_CACHE> if you do not want to use an SSD read cache with
your Intelligent-Tiering file system.

=item *

Set to C<USER_PROVISIONED> to specify the exact size of your SSD read
cache.

=item *

Set to C<PROPORTIONAL_TO_THROUGHPUT_CAPACITY> to have your SSD read
cache automatically sized based on your throughput capacity.
