=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::StorageVirtualMachine

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::StorageVirtualMachine object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveDirectoryConfiguration => $value, ..., UUID => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::StorageVirtualMachine object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveDirectoryConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM)
configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveDirectoryConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::SvmActiveDirectoryConfiguration>

Describes the Microsoft Active Directory configuration to which the SVM
is joined, if applicable.


=head2 CreationTime => Str




=head2 Endpoints => L<Paws::FSX::SvmEndpoints>

The endpoints that are used to access data or to manage the SVM using
the NetApp ONTAP CLI, REST API, or NetApp CloudManager. They are the
C<Iscsi>, C<Management>, C<Nfs>, and C<Smb> endpoints.


=head2 FileSystemId => Str




=head2 Lifecycle => Str

Describes the SVM's lifecycle status.

=over

=item *

C<CREATED> - The SVM is fully available for use.

=item *

C<CREATING> - Amazon FSx is creating the new SVM.

=item *

C<DELETING> - Amazon FSx is deleting an existing SVM.

=item *

C<FAILED> - Amazon FSx was unable to create the SVM.

=item *

C<MISCONFIGURED> - The SVM is in a failed but recoverable state.

=item *

C<PENDING> - Amazon FSx has not started creating the SVM.

=back



=head2 LifecycleTransitionReason => L<Paws::FSX::LifecycleTransitionReason>

Describes why the SVM lifecycle state changed.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the SVM, if provisioned.


=head2 ResourceARN => Str




=head2 RootVolumeSecurityStyle => Str

The security style of the root volume of the SVM.


=head2 StorageVirtualMachineId => Str

The SVM's system generated unique ID.


=head2 Subtype => Str

Describes the SVM's subtype.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::Tag>]




=head2 UUID => Str

The SVM's UUID (universally unique identifier).
