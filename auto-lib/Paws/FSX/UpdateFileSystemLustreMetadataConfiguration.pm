=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Iops => $value, ..., Mode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Iops

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Lustre metadata performance configuration update for an Amazon FSx
for Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type. You can
request an increase in your file system's Metadata IOPS and/or switch
your file system's metadata configuration mode. For more information,
see Managing metadata performance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-metadata-performance.html)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Iops => Int

(USER_PROVISIONED mode only) Specifies the number of Metadata IOPS to
provision for your file system. Valid values are C<1500>, C<3000>,
C<6000>, C<12000>, and multiples of C<12000> up to a maximum of
C<192000>.

The value you provide must be greater than or equal to the current
number of Metadata IOPS provisioned for the file system.


=head2 Mode => Str

The metadata configuration mode for provisioning Metadata IOPS for an
FSx for Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type.

=over

=item *

To increase the Metadata IOPS or to switch from AUTOMATIC mode, specify
C<USER_PROVISIONED> as the value for this parameter. Then use the Iops
parameter to provide a Metadata IOPS value that is greater than or
equal to the current number of Metadata IOPS provisioned for the file
system.

=item *

To switch from USER_PROVISIONED mode, specify C<AUTOMATIC> as the value
for this parameter, but do not input a value for Iops.

If you request to switch from USER_PROVISIONED to AUTOMATIC mode and
the current Metadata IOPS value is greater than the automated default,
FSx for Lustre rejects the request because downscaling Metadata IOPS is
not supported.
