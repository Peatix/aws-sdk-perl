=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::FileCacheLustreConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::FileCacheLustreConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeploymentType => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::FileCacheLustreConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeploymentType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for the Amazon File Cache resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeploymentType => Str

The deployment type of the Amazon File Cache resource, which must be
C<CACHE_1>.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreLogConfiguration>

The configuration for Lustre logging used to write the enabled logging
events for your Amazon File Cache resource to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 MetadataConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::FileCacheLustreMetadataConfiguration>

The configuration for a Lustre MDT (Metadata Target) storage volume.


=head2 MountName => Str

You use the C<MountName> value when mounting the cache. If you pass a
cache ID to the C<DescribeFileCaches> operation, it returns the the
C<MountName> value as part of the cache's description.


=head2 PerUnitStorageThroughput => Int

Per unit storage throughput represents the megabytes per second of read
or write throughput per 1 tebibyte of storage provisioned. Cache
throughput capacity is equal to Storage capacity (TiB) *
PerUnitStorageThroughput (MB/s/TiB). The only supported value is
C<1000>.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str





=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::FSX>
