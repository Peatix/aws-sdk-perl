=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoImportPolicy => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoImportPolicy

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoImportPolicy => Str

(Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects
appear as file and directory listings. Use this parameter to choose how
Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listings up to date as you add
or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. C<AutoImportPolicy> can
have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and
directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is
created. FSx does not update file and directory listings for any new or
changed objects after choosing this option.

=item *

C<NEW> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory
listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not
currently exist in the FSx file system.

=item *

C<NEW_CHANGED> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports
file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket
and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you
choose this option.

=item *

C<NEW_CHANGED_DELETED> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically
imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3
bucket, any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket, and any
objects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

=back

For more information, see Automatically import updates from your S3
bucket
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/older-deployment-types.html#legacy-auto-import-from-s3).

This parameter is not supported for file systems with a data repository
association.


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int

The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this property
to C<0> disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups
for a maximum of 90 days. The default is C<0>.


=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

(Optional) Not available for use with file systems that are linked to a
data repository. A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the file
system should be copied to backups. The default value is false. If
C<CopyTagsToBackups> is set to true, all file system tags are copied to
all automatic and user-initiated backups when the user doesn't specify
any backup-specific tags. If C<CopyTagsToBackups> is set to true and
you specify one or more backup tags, only the specified tags are copied
to backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a
user-initiated backup, no tags are copied from the file system,
regardless of this value.

(Default = C<false>)

For more information, see Working with backups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-backups-fsx.html)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.


=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 DataCompressionType => Str

Sets the data compression configuration for the file system.
C<DataCompressionType> can have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - (Default) Data compression is turned off when the file system
is created.

=item *

C<LZ4> - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

=back

For more information, see Lustre data compression
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.


=head2 DeploymentType => Str

(Optional) Choose C<SCRATCH_1> and C<SCRATCH_2> deployment types when
you need temporary storage and shorter-term processing of data. The
C<SCRATCH_2> deployment type provides in-transit encryption of data and
higher burst throughput capacity than C<SCRATCH_1>.

Choose C<PERSISTENT_1> for longer-term storage and for
throughput-focused workloads that arenE<rsquo>t latency-sensitive.
C<PERSISTENT_1> supports encryption of data in transit, and is
available in all Amazon Web Services Regions in which FSx for Lustre is
available.

Choose C<PERSISTENT_2> for longer-term storage and for
latency-sensitive workloads that require the highest levels of
IOPS/throughput. C<PERSISTENT_2> supports SSD storage, and offers
higher C<PerUnitStorageThroughput> (up to 1000 MB/s/TiB). You can
optionally specify a metadata configuration mode for C<PERSISTENT_2>
which supports increasing metadata performance. C<PERSISTENT_2> is
available in a limited number of Amazon Web Services Regions. For more
information, and an up-to-date list of Amazon Web Services Regions in
which C<PERSISTENT_2> is available, see File system deployment options
for FSx for Lustre
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/using-fsx-lustre.html#lustre-deployment-types)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.

If you choose C<PERSISTENT_2>, and you set C<FileSystemTypeVersion> to
C<2.10>, the C<CreateFileSystem> operation fails.

Encryption of data in transit is automatically turned on when you
access C<SCRATCH_2>, C<PERSISTENT_1>, and C<PERSISTENT_2> file systems
from Amazon EC2 instances that support automatic encryption in the
Amazon Web Services Regions where they are available. For more
information about encryption in transit for FSx for Lustre file
systems, see Encrypting data in transit
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/encryption-in-transit-fsxl.html)
in the I<Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide>.

(Default = C<SCRATCH_1>)


=head2 DriveCacheType => Str

The type of drive cache used by C<PERSISTENT_1> file systems that are
provisioned with HDD storage devices. This parameter is required when
storage type is HDD. Set this property to C<READ> to improve the
performance for frequently accessed files by caching up to 20% of the
total storage capacity of the file system.

This parameter is required when C<StorageType> is set to C<HDD>.


=head2 EfaEnabled => Bool

(Optional) Specifies whether Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) and GPUDirect
Storage (GDS) support is enabled for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file
system.

(Default = C<false>)


=head2 ExportPath => Str

(Optional) Specifies the path in the Amazon S3 bucket where the root of
your Amazon FSx file system is exported. The path must use the same
Amazon S3 bucket as specified in ImportPath. You can provide an
optional prefix to which new and changed data is to be exported from
your Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. If an C<ExportPath> value is
not provided, Amazon FSx sets a default export path,
C<s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre[creation-timestamp]>. The timestamp is
in UTC format, for example
C<s3://import-bucket/FSxLustre20181105T222312Z>.

The Amazon S3 export bucket must be the same as the import bucket
specified by C<ImportPath>. If you specify only a bucket name, such as
C<s3://import-bucket>, you get a 1:1 mapping of file system objects to
S3 bucket objects. This mapping means that the input data in S3 is
overwritten on export. If you provide a custom prefix in the export
path, such as C<s3://import-bucket/[custom-optional-prefix]>, Amazon
FSx exports the contents of your file system to that export prefix in
the Amazon S3 bucket.

This parameter is not supported for file systems with a data repository
association.


=head2 ImportedFileChunkSize => Int

(Optional) For files imported from a data repository, this value
determines the stripe count and maximum amount of data per file (in
MiB) stored on a single physical disk. The maximum number of disks that
a single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of
disks that make up the file system.

The default chunk size is 1,024 MiB (1 GiB) and can go as high as
512,000 MiB (500 GiB). Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB.

This parameter is not supported for file systems with a data repository
association.


=head2 ImportPath => Str

(Optional) The path to the Amazon S3 bucket (including the optional
prefix) that you're using as the data repository for your Amazon FSx
for Lustre file system. The root of your FSx for Lustre file system
will be mapped to the root of the Amazon S3 bucket you select. An
example is C<s3://import-bucket/optional-prefix>. If you specify a
prefix after the Amazon S3 bucket name, only object keys with that
prefix are loaded into the file system.

This parameter is not supported for file systems with a data repository
association.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreLogCreateConfiguration>

The Lustre logging configuration used when creating an Amazon FSx for
Lustre file system. When logging is enabled, Lustre logs error and
warning events for data repositories associated with your file system
to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 MetadataConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::CreateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration>

The Lustre metadata performance configuration for the creation of an
FSx for Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type.


=head2 PerUnitStorageThroughput => Int

Required with C<PERSISTENT_1> and C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment types,
provisions the amount of read and write throughput for each 1 tebibyte
(TiB) of file system storage capacity, in MB/s/TiB. File system
throughput capacity is calculated by multiplying le system storage
capacity (TiB) by the C<PerUnitStorageThroughput> (MB/s/TiB). For a
2.4-TiB le system, provisioning 50 MB/s/TiB of
C<PerUnitStorageThroughput> yields 120 MB/s of le system throughput.
You pay for the amount of throughput that you provision.

Valid values:

=over

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_1> SSD storage: 50, 100, 200 MB/s/TiB.

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_1> HDD storage: 12, 40 MB/s/TiB.

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_2> SSD storage: 125, 250, 500, 1000 MB/s/TiB.

=back



=head2 RootSquashConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreRootSquashConfiguration>

The Lustre root squash configuration used when creating an Amazon FSx
for Lustre file system. When enabled, root squash restricts root-level
access from clients that try to access your file system as a root user.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str

(Optional) The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance,
formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone, where d is the weekday number,
from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.
