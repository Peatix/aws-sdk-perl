=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::DeleteFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::DeleteFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FinalBackupTags => $value, ..., SkipFinalBackup => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::DeleteFileSystemOpenZFSConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FinalBackupTags

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration object for the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system
used in the C<DeleteFileSystem> operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FinalBackupTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FSX::Tag>]

A list of tags to apply to the file system's final backup.


=head2 Options => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

To delete a file system if there are child volumes present below the
root volume, use the string C<DELETE_CHILD_VOLUMES_AND_SNAPSHOTS>. If
your file system has child volumes and you don't use this option, the
delete request will fail.


=head2 SkipFinalBackup => Bool

By default, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS takes a final backup on your behalf
when the C<DeleteFileSystem> operation is invoked. Doing this helps
protect you from data loss, and we highly recommend taking the final
backup. If you want to skip taking a final backup, set this value to
C<true>.



=head1 SEE ALSO
