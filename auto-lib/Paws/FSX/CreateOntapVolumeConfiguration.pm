=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::CreateOntapVolumeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::CreateOntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregateConfiguration => $value, ..., VolumeStyle => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::CreateOntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregateConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration of the ONTAP volume that you are creating.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggregateConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::CreateAggregateConfiguration>

Use to specify configuration options for a volumeE<rsquo>s storage
aggregate or aggregates.


=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume should be copied
to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags
for the volume are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups
where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is true, and you
specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to
backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated
backup, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this value.


=head2 JunctionPath => Str

Specifies the location in the SVM's namespace where the volume is
mounted. This parameter is required. The C<JunctionPath> must have a
leading forward slash, such as C</vol3>.


=head2 OntapVolumeType => Str

Specifies the type of volume you are creating. Valid values are the
following:

=over

=item *

C<RW> specifies a read/write volume. C<RW> is the default.

=item *

C<DP> specifies a data-protection volume. A C<DP> volume is read-only
and can be used as the destination of a NetApp SnapMirror relationship.

=back

For more information, see Volume types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-volumes.html#volume-types)
in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.


=head2 SecurityStyle => Str

Specifies the security style for the volume. If a volume's security
style is not specified, it is automatically set to the root volume's
security style. The security style determines the type of permissions
that FSx for ONTAP uses to control data access. Specify one of the
following values:

=over

=item *

C<UNIX> if the file system is managed by a UNIX administrator, the
majority of users are NFS clients, and an application accessing the
data uses a UNIX user as the service account.

=item *

C<NTFS> if the file system is managed by a Windows administrator, the
majority of users are SMB clients, and an application accessing the
data uses a Windows user as the service account.

=item *

C<MIXED> This is an advanced setting. For more information, see the
topic What the security styles and their effects are
(https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-admin/security-styles-their-effects-concept.html)
in the NetApp Documentation Center.

=back

For more information, see Volume security style
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-volumes.html#volume-security-style)
in the FSx for ONTAP User Guide.


=head2 SizeInBytes => Int

Specifies the configured size of the volume, in bytes.


=head2 SizeInMegabytes => Int

Use C<SizeInBytes> instead. Specifies the size of the volume, in
megabytes (MB), that you are creating.


=head2 SnaplockConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::CreateSnaplockConfiguration>

Specifies the SnapLock configuration for an FSx for ONTAP volume.


=head2 SnapshotPolicy => Str

Specifies the snapshot policy for the volume. There are three built-in
snapshot policies:

=over

=item *

C<default>: This is the default policy. A maximum of six hourly
snapshots taken five minutes past the hour. A maximum of two daily
snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight. A
maximum of two weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at 15 minutes after
midnight.

=item *

C<default-1weekly>: This policy is the same as the C<default> policy
except that it only retains one snapshot from the weekly schedule.

=item *

C<none>: This policy does not take any snapshots. This policy can be
assigned to volumes to prevent automatic snapshots from being taken.

=back

You can also provide the name of a custom policy that you created with
the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

For more information, see Snapshot policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snapshots-ontap.html#snapshot-policies)
in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.


=head2 StorageEfficiencyEnabled => Bool

Set to true to enable deduplication, compression, and compaction
storage efficiency features on the volume, or set to false to disable
them.

C<StorageEfficiencyEnabled> is required when creating a C<RW> volume
(C<OntapVolumeType> set to C<RW>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StorageVirtualMachineId => Str

Specifies the ONTAP SVM in which to create the volume.


=head2 TieringPolicy => L<Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy>




=head2 VolumeStyle => Str

Use to specify the style of an ONTAP volume. FSx for ONTAP offers two
styles of volumes that you can use for different purposes, FlexVol and
FlexGroup volumes. For more information, see Volume styles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-volumes.html#volume-styles)
in the Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide.
