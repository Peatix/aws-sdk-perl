=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::UpdateOntapVolumeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::UpdateOntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CopyTagsToBackups => $value, ..., TieringPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::UpdateOntapVolumeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CopyTagsToBackups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used to specify changes to the ONTAP configuration for the volume you
are updating.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyTagsToBackups => Bool

A boolean flag indicating whether tags for the volume should be copied
to backups. This value defaults to false. If it's set to true, all tags
for the volume are copied to all automatic and user-initiated backups
where the user doesn't specify tags. If this value is true, and you
specify one or more tags, only the specified tags are copied to
backups. If you specify one or more tags when creating a user-initiated
backup, no tags are copied from the volume, regardless of this value.


=head2 JunctionPath => Str

Specifies the location in the SVM's namespace where the volume is
mounted. The C<JunctionPath> must have a leading forward slash, such as
C</vol3>.


=head2 SecurityStyle => Str

The security style for the volume, which can be C<UNIX>, C<NTFS>, or
C<MIXED>.


=head2 SizeInBytes => Int

The configured size of the volume, in bytes.


=head2 SizeInMegabytes => Int

Specifies the size of the volume in megabytes.


=head2 SnaplockConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::UpdateSnaplockConfiguration>

The configuration object for updating the SnapLock configuration of an
FSx for ONTAP SnapLock volume.


=head2 SnapshotPolicy => Str

Specifies the snapshot policy for the volume. There are three built-in
snapshot policies:

=over

=item *

C<default>: This is the default policy. A maximum of six hourly
snapshots taken five minutes past the hour. A maximum of two daily
snapshots taken Monday through Saturday at 10 minutes after midnight. A
maximum of two weekly snapshots taken every Sunday at 15 minutes after
midnight.

=item *

C<default-1weekly>: This policy is the same as the C<default> policy
except that it only retains one snapshot from the weekly schedule.

=item *

C<none>: This policy does not take any snapshots. This policy can be
assigned to volumes to prevent automatic snapshots from being taken.

=back

You can also provide the name of a custom policy that you created with
the ONTAP CLI or REST API.

For more information, see Snapshot policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/snapshots-ontap.html#snapshot-policies)
in the I<Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP User Guide>.


=head2 StorageEfficiencyEnabled => Bool

Default is C<false>. Set to true to enable the deduplication,
compression, and compaction storage efficiency features on the volume.


=head2 TieringPolicy => L<Paws::FSX::TieringPolicy>

Update the volume's data tiering policy.
