=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoImportPolicy => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoImportPolicy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration object for Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems used in
the C<UpdateFileSystem> operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoImportPolicy => Str

(Optional) When you create your file system, your existing S3 objects
appear as file and directory listings. Use this property to choose how
Amazon FSx keeps your file and directory listing up to date as you add
or modify objects in your linked S3 bucket. C<AutoImportPolicy> can
have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - (Default) AutoImport is off. Amazon FSx only updates file and
directory listings from the linked S3 bucket when the file system is
created. FSx does not update the file and directory listing for any new
or changed objects after choosing this option.

=item *

C<NEW> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports directory
listings of any new objects added to the linked S3 bucket that do not
currently exist in the FSx file system.

=item *

C<NEW_CHANGED> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically imports
file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3 bucket
and any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket after you
choose this option.

=item *

C<NEW_CHANGED_DELETED> - AutoImport is on. Amazon FSx automatically
imports file and directory listings of any new objects added to the S3
bucket, any existing objects that are changed in the S3 bucket, and any
objects that were deleted in the S3 bucket.

=back

This parameter is not supported for file systems with a data repository
association.


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int

The number of days to retain automatic backups. Setting this property
to C<0> disables automatic backups. You can retain automatic backups
for a maximum of 90 days. The default is C<0>.


=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 DataCompressionType => Str

Sets the data compression configuration for the file system.
C<DataCompressionType> can have the following values:

=over

=item *

C<NONE> - Data compression is turned off for the file system.

=item *

C<LZ4> - Data compression is turned on with the LZ4 algorithm.

=back

If you don't use C<DataCompressionType>, the file system retains its
current data compression configuration.

For more information, see Lustre data compression
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/data-compression.html).


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreLogCreateConfiguration>

The Lustre logging configuration used when updating an Amazon FSx for
Lustre file system. When logging is enabled, Lustre logs error and
warning events for data repositories associated with your file system
to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.


=head2 MetadataConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemLustreMetadataConfiguration>

The Lustre metadata performance configuration for an Amazon FSx for
Lustre file system using a C<PERSISTENT_2> deployment type. When this
configuration is enabled, the file system supports increasing metadata
performance.


=head2 PerUnitStorageThroughput => Int

The throughput of an Amazon FSx for Lustre Persistent SSD-based file
system, measured in megabytes per second per tebibyte (MB/s/TiB). You
can increase or decrease your file system's throughput. Valid values
depend on the deployment type of the file system, as follows:

=over

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_1> SSD-based deployment types, valid values are 50,
100, and 200 MB/s/TiB.

=item *

For C<PERSISTENT_2> SSD-based deployment types, valid values are 125,
250, 500, and 1000 MB/s/TiB.

=back

For more information, see Managing throughput capacity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/managing-throughput-capacity.html).


=head2 RootSquashConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::LustreRootSquashConfiguration>

The Lustre root squash configuration used when updating an Amazon FSx
for Lustre file system. When enabled, root squash restricts root-level
access from clients that try to access your file system as a root user.


=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str

(Optional) The preferred start time to perform weekly maintenance,
formatted d:HH:MM in the UTC time zone. d is the weekday number, from 1
through 7, beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday.
