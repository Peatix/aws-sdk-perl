=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::Alias

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::Alias object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Lifecycle => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::Alias object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Lifecycle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A DNS alias that is associated with the file system. You can use a DNS
alias to access a file system using user-defined DNS names, in addition
to the default DNS name that Amazon FSx assigns to the file system. For
more information, see DNS aliases
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-dns-aliases.html)
in the I<FSx for Windows File Server User Guide>.
