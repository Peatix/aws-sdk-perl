=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DnsIps => $value, ..., UserName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::SelfManagedActiveDirectoryConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DnsIps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration that Amazon FSx uses to join a FSx for Windows File
Server file system or an FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machine (SVM) to
a self-managed (including on-premises) Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
directory. For more information, see Using Amazon FSx for Windows with
your self-managed Microsoft Active Directory
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/self-managed-AD.html)
or Managing FSx for ONTAP SVMs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-svms.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DnsIps => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of up to three IP addresses of DNS servers or domain controllers
in the self-managed AD directory.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainName => Str

The fully qualified domain name of the self-managed AD directory, such
as C<corp.example.com>.


=head2 FileSystemAdministratorsGroup => Str

(Optional) The name of the domain group whose members are granted
administrative privileges for the file system. Administrative
privileges include taking ownership of files and folders, setting audit
controls (audit ACLs) on files and folders, and administering the file
system remotely by using the FSx Remote PowerShell. The group that you
specify must already exist in your domain. If you don't provide one,
your AD domain's Domain Admins group is used.


=head2 OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName => Str

(Optional) The fully qualified distinguished name of the organizational
unit within your self-managed AD directory. Amazon FSx only accepts OU
as the direct parent of the file system. An example is
C<OU=FSx,DC=yourdomain,DC=corp,DC=com>. To learn more, see RFC 2253
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253). If none is provided, the FSx
file system is created in the default location of your self-managed AD
directory.

Only Organizational Unit (OU) objects can be the direct parent of the
file system that you're creating.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Password => Str

The password for the service account on your self-managed AD domain
that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UserName => Str

The user name for the service account on your self-managed AD domain
that Amazon FSx will use to join to your AD domain. This account must
have the permission to join computers to the domain in the
organizational unit provided in C<OrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName>,
or in the default location of your AD domain.
