=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemOntapConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemOntapConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddRouteTableIds => $value, ..., WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::UpdateFileSystemOntapConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddRouteTableIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration updates for an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file
system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddRouteTableIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

(Multi-AZ only) A list of IDs of new virtual private cloud (VPC) route
tables to associate (add) with your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file
system.


=head2 AutomaticBackupRetentionDays => Int




=head2 DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime => Str




=head2 DiskIopsConfiguration => L<Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration>

The SSD IOPS (input output operations per second) configuration for an
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. The default is 3 IOPS per GB
of storage capacity, but you can provision additional IOPS per GB of
storage. The configuration consists of an IOPS mode (C<AUTOMATIC> or
C<USER_PROVISIONED>), and in the case of C<USER_PROVISIONED> IOPS, the
total number of SSD IOPS provisioned. For more information, see
Updating SSD storage capacity and IOPS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/increase-primary-storage.html).


=head2 FsxAdminPassword => Str

Update the password for the C<fsxadmin> user by entering a new
password. You use the C<fsxadmin> user to access the NetApp ONTAP CLI
and REST API to manage your file system resources. For more
information, see Managing resources using NetApp Application
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-resources-ontap-apps.html).


=head2 HAPairs => Int

Use to update the number of high-availability (HA) pairs for a
second-generation single-AZ file system. If you increase the number of
HA pairs for your file system, you must specify proportional increases
for C<StorageCapacity>, C<Iops>, and C<ThroughputCapacity>. For more
information, see High-availability (HA) pairs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/administering-file-systems.html#HA-pairs)
in the FSx for ONTAP user guide. Block storage protocol support (iSCSI
and NVMe over TCP) is disabled on file systems with more than 6 HA
pairs. For more information, see Using block storage protocols
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/supported-fsx-clients.html#using-block-storage).


=head2 RemoveRouteTableIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

(Multi-AZ only) A list of IDs of existing virtual private cloud (VPC)
route tables to disassociate (remove) from your Amazon FSx for NetApp
ONTAP file system. You can use the API operation to retrieve the list
of VPC route table IDs for a file system.


=head2 ThroughputCapacity => Int

Enter a new value to change the amount of throughput capacity for the
file system in megabytes per second (MBps). For more information, see
Managing throughput capacity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/ONTAPGuide/managing-throughput-capacity.html)
in the FSx for ONTAP User Guide.

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> and C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
are not the same value.

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> when divided by the value of
C<HAPairs> is outside of the valid range for C<ThroughputCapacity>.

=back



=head2 ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair => Int

Use to choose the throughput capacity per HA pair, rather than the
total throughput for the file system.

This field and C<ThroughputCapacity> cannot be defined in the same API
call, but one is required.

This field and C<ThroughputCapacity> are the same for file systems with
one HA pair.

=over

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_1> and C<MULTI_AZ_1> file systems, valid values are
128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096 MBps.

=item *

For C<SINGLE_AZ_2>, valid values are 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=item *

For C<MULTI_AZ_2>, valid values are 384, 768, 1536, 3072, or 6144 MBps.

=back

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) for the
following conditions:

=over

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacity> and C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair>
are not the same value for file systems with one HA pair.

=item *

The value of deployment type is C<SINGLE_AZ_2> and
C<ThroughputCapacity> / C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid
HA pair (a value between 1 and 12).

=item *

The value of C<ThroughputCapacityPerHAPair> is not a valid value.

=back



=head2 WeeklyMaintenanceStartTime => Str
