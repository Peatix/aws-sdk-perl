=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Iops => $value, ..., Mode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::DiskIopsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Iops

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SSD IOPS (input/output operations per second) configuration for an
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, or FSx
for OpenZFS file system. By default, Amazon FSx automatically
provisions 3 IOPS per GB of storage capacity. You can provision
additional IOPS per GB of storage. The configuration consists of the
total number of provisioned SSD IOPS and how it is was provisioned, or
the mode (by the customer or by Amazon FSx).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Iops => Int

The total number of SSD IOPS provisioned for the file system.

The minimum and maximum values for this property depend on the value of
C<HAPairs> and C<StorageCapacity>. The minimum value is calculated as
C<StorageCapacity> * 3 * C<HAPairs> (3 IOPS per GB of
C<StorageCapacity>). The maximum value is calculated as 200,000 *
C<HAPairs>.

Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request) if the
value of C<Iops> is outside of the minimum or maximum values.


=head2 Mode => Str

Specifies whether the file system is using the C<AUTOMATIC> setting of
SSD IOPS of 3 IOPS per GB of storage capacity, or if it using a
C<USER_PROVISIONED> value.
