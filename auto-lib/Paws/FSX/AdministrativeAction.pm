=head1 NAME

Paws::FSX::AdministrativeAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FSX::AdministrativeAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdministrativeActionType => $value, ..., TotalTransferBytes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FSX::AdministrativeAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdministrativeActionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a specific Amazon FSx administrative action for the current
Windows, Lustre, OpenZFS, or ONTAP file system or volume.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdministrativeActionType => Str




=head2 FailureDetails => L<Paws::FSX::AdministrativeActionFailureDetails>




=head2 ProgressPercent => Int

The percentage-complete status of a C<STORAGE_OPTIMIZATION> or
C<DOWNLOAD_DATA_FROM_BACKUP> administrative action. Does not apply to
any other administrative action type.


=head2 RemainingTransferBytes => Int

The remaining bytes to transfer for the FSx for OpenZFS snapshot that
you're copying.


=head2 RequestTime => Str

The time that the administrative action request was received.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the administrative action, as follows:

=over

=item *

C<FAILED> - Amazon FSx failed to process the administrative action
successfully.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> - Amazon FSx is processing the administrative action.

=item *

C<PENDING> - Amazon FSx is waiting to process the administrative
action.

=item *

C<COMPLETED> - Amazon FSx has finished processing the administrative
task.

For a backup restore to a second-generation FSx for ONTAP file system,
indicates that all data has been downloaded to the volume, and clients
now have read-write access to volume.

=item *

C<UPDATED_OPTIMIZING> - For a storage-capacity increase update, Amazon
FSx has updated the file system with the new storage capacity, and is
now performing the storage-optimization process.

=item *

C<PENDING> - For a backup restore to a second-generation FSx for ONTAP
file system, indicates that the file metadata is being downloaded onto
the volume. The volume's Lifecycle state is CREATING.

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> - For a backup restore to a second-generation FSx for
ONTAP file system, indicates that all metadata has been downloaded to
the new volume and client can access data with read-only access while
Amazon FSx downloads the file data to the volume. Track the progress of
this process with the C<ProgressPercent> element.

=back



=head2 TargetFileSystemValues => L<Paws::FSX::FileSystem>

The target value for the administration action, provided in the
C<UpdateFileSystem> operation. Returned for C<FILE_SYSTEM_UPDATE>
administrative actions.


=head2 TargetSnapshotValues => L<Paws::FSX::Snapshot>




=head2 TargetVolumeValues => L<Paws::FSX::Volume>




=head2 TotalTransferBytes => Int

The number of bytes that have transferred for the FSx for OpenZFS
snapshot that you're copying.
