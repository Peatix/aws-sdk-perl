This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::QApps::FormInputCard object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeMode => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::QApps::FormInputCard object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A card in an Amazon Q App that allows the user to submit a response.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeMode => Str

The compute mode of the form input card. This property determines
whether individual participants of a data collection session can submit
multiple response or one response. A compute mode of C<append> shall
allow participants to submit the same form multiple times with
different values. A compute mode of C<replace>codeE<gt> shall overwrite
the current value for each participant.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Dependencies => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Any dependencies or requirements for the form input card.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The unique identifier of the form input card.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metadata => L<Paws::QApps::FormInputCardMetadata>

The metadata that defines the form input card data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Title => Str

The title of the form input card.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str
