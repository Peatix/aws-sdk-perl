=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $workmail = Paws->service('WorkMail');
    my $DeleteOrganizationResponse = $workmail->DeleteOrganization(
      DeleteDirectory                 => 1,
      OrganizationId                  => 'MyOrganizationId',
      ClientToken                     => 'MyIdempotencyClientToken',  # OPTIONAL
      DeleteIdentityCenterApplication => 1,                           # OPTIONAL
      ForceDelete                     => 1,                           # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $OrganizationId = $DeleteOrganizationResponse->OrganizationId;
    my $State          = $DeleteOrganizationResponse->State;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WorkMail::DeleteOrganizationResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
