=head1 NAME

Paws::VoiceID::AuthenticationResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VoiceID::AuthenticationResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioAggregationEndedAt => $value, ..., Score => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::AuthenticationResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioAggregationEndedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The authentication result produced by Voice ID, processed against the
current session state and streamed audio of the speaker.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AudioAggregationEndedAt => Str

A timestamp of when audio aggregation ended for this authentication
result.


=head2 AudioAggregationStartedAt => Str

A timestamp of when audio aggregation started for this authentication
result.


=head2 AuthenticationResultId => Str

The unique identifier for this authentication result. Because there can
be multiple authentications for a given session, this field helps to
identify if the returned result is from a previous streaming activity
or a new result. Note that in absence of any new streaming activity,
C<AcceptanceThreshold> changes, or C<SpeakerId> changes, Voice ID
always returns cached Authentication Result for this API.


=head2 Configuration => L<Paws::VoiceID::AuthenticationConfiguration>

The C<AuthenticationConfiguration> used to generate this authentication
result.


=head2 CustomerSpeakerId => Str

The client-provided identifier for the speaker whose authentication
result is produced. Only present if a C<SpeakerId> is provided for the
session.


=head2 Decision => Str

The authentication decision produced by Voice ID, processed against the
current session state and streamed audio of the speaker.


=head2 GeneratedSpeakerId => Str

The service-generated identifier for the speaker whose authentication
result is produced.


=head2 Score => Int

The authentication score for the speaker whose authentication result is
produced. This value is only present if the authentication decision is
either C<ACCEPT> or C<REJECT>.
