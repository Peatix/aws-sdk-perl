Paws::VoiceID::RegistrationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VoiceID::RegistrationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DuplicateRegistrationAction => $value, ..., WatchlistIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::RegistrationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DuplicateRegistrationAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The registration configuration to be used during the batch fraudster
registration job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DuplicateRegistrationAction => Str

The action to take when a fraudster is identified as a duplicate. The
default action is C<SKIP>, which skips registering the duplicate
fraudster. Setting the value to C<REGISTER_AS_NEW> always registers a
new fraudster into the specified domain.


=head2 FraudsterSimilarityThreshold => Int

The minimum similarity score between the new and old fraudsters in
order to consider the new fraudster a duplicate.


=head2 WatchlistIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifiers of watchlists that a fraudster is registered to. If a
watchlist isn't provided, the fraudsters are registered to the default
watchlist.
