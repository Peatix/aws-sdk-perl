=head1 NAME

Paws::VoiceID::FraudDetectionResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VoiceID::FraudDetectionResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioAggregationEndedAt => $value, ..., RiskDetails => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::FraudDetectionResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioAggregationEndedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fraud detection result produced by Voice ID, processed against the
current session state and streamed audio of the speaker.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AudioAggregationEndedAt => Str

A timestamp of when audio aggregation ended for this fraud detection
result.


=head2 AudioAggregationStartedAt => Str

A timestamp of when audio aggregation started for this fraud detection
result.


=head2 Configuration => L<Paws::VoiceID::FraudDetectionConfiguration>

The C<FraudDetectionConfiguration> used to generate this fraud
detection result.


=head2 Decision => Str

The fraud detection decision produced by Voice ID, processed against
the current session state and streamed audio of the speaker.


=head2 FraudDetectionResultId => Str

The unique identifier for this fraud detection result. Given there can
be multiple fraud detections for a given session, this field helps in
identifying if the returned result is from previous streaming activity
or a new result. Note that in the absence of any new streaming activity
or risk threshold changes, Voice ID always returns cached Fraud
Detection result for this API.


=head2 Reasons => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The reason speaker was flagged by the fraud detection system. This is
only be populated if fraud detection Decision is C<HIGH_RISK>, and the
following possible values: C<KNOWN_FRAUDSTER> and C<VOICE_SPOOFING>.


=head2 RiskDetails => L<Paws::VoiceID::FraudRiskDetails>

Details about each risk analyzed for this speaker. Currently, this
contains KnownFraudsterRisk and VoiceSpoofingRisk details.
