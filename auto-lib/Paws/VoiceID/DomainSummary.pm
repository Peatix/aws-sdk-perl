=head1 NAME

Paws::VoiceID::DomainSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VoiceID::DomainSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., WatchlistDetails => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::DomainSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a summary of information about a domain.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the domain.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The timestamp of when the domain was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the domain.


=head2 DomainId => Str

The identifier of the domain.


=head2 DomainStatus => Str

The current status of the domain.


=head2 Name => Str

The client-provided name for the domain.


=head2 ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::VoiceID::ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration>

The server-side encryption configuration containing the KMS key
identifier you want Voice ID to use to encrypt your data.


=head2 ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails => L<Paws::VoiceID::ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails>

Details about the most recent server-side encryption configuration
update. When the server-side encryption configuration is changed,
dependency on the old KMS key is removed through an asynchronous
process. When this update is complete, the domain's data can only be
accessed using the new KMS key.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The timestamp of when the domain was last updated.


=head2 WatchlistDetails => L<Paws::VoiceID::WatchlistDetails>

Provides information about C<watchlistDetails> and
C<DefaultWatchlistID>.
