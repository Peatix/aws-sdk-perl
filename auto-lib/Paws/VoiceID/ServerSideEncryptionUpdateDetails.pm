=head1 NAME

Paws::VoiceID::ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VoiceID::ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Message => $value, ..., UpdateStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::ServerSideEncryptionUpdateDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Message

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about the most recent server-side encryption configuration
update. When the server-side encryption configuration is changed,
dependency on the old KMS key is removed through an asynchronous
process. When this update is complete, the domainE<rsquo>s data can
only be accessed using the new KMS key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Message => Str

Message explaining the current UpdateStatus. When the UpdateStatus is
FAILED, this message explains the cause of the failure.


=head2 OldKmsKeyId => Str

The previous KMS key ID the domain was encrypted with, before
ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration was updated to a new KMS key ID.


=head2 UpdateStatus => Str

Status of the server-side encryption update. During an update, if there
is an issue with the domain's current or old KMS key ID, such as an
inaccessible or disabled key, then the status is FAILED. In order to
resolve this, the key needs to be made accessible, and then an
UpdateDomain call with the existing server-side encryption
configuration will re-attempt this update process.
