  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FraudDetectionAction => $value, ..., WatchlistIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VoiceID::EnrollmentJobFraudDetectionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FraudDetectionAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The fraud detection configuration to be used during the batch speaker
enrollment job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FraudDetectionAction => Str

The action to take when the given speaker is flagged by the fraud
detection system. The default value is C<FAIL>, which fails the speaker
enrollment. Changing this value to C<IGNORE> results in the speaker
being enrolled even if they are flagged by the fraud detection system.


=head2 RiskThreshold => Int

Threshold value for determining whether the speaker is a high risk to
be fraudulent. If the detected risk score calculated by Voice ID is
greater than or equal to the threshold, the speaker is considered a
fraudster.


=head2 WatchlistIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifier of watchlists against which fraud detection is
performed.
