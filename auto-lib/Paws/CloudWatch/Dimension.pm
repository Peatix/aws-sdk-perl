=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::Dimension

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::Dimension object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::Dimension object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a
metric. Because dimensions are part of the unique identifier for a
metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one of your
metrics, you are creating a new variation of that metric. For example,
many Amazon EC2 metrics publish C<InstanceId> as a dimension name, and
the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
