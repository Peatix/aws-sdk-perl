=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::Entity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::Entity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attributes => $value, ..., KeyAttributes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::Entity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Attributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An entity associated with metrics, to allow for finding related
telemetry. An entity is typically a resource or service within your
system. For example, metrics from an Amazon EC2 instance could be
associated with that instance as the entity. Similarly, metrics from a
service that you own could be associated with that service as the
entity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::CloudWatch::EntityAttributesMap>

Additional attributes of the entity that are not used to specify the
identity of the entity. A list of key-value pairs.

For details about how to use the attributes, see How to add related
information to telemetry
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/adding-your-own-related-telemetry.html)
in the I<CloudWatch User Guide>.


=head2 KeyAttributes => L<Paws::CloudWatch::EntityKeyAttributesMap>

The attributes of the entity which identify the specific entity, as a
list of key-value pairs. Entities with the same C<KeyAttributes> are
considered to be the same entity. For an entity to be valid, the
C<KeyAttributes> must exist and be formatted correctly.

There are five allowed attributes (key names): C<Type>,
C<ResourceType>, C<Identifier>, C<Name>, and C<Environment>.

For details about how to use the key attributes to specify an entity,
see How to add related information to telemetry
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/adding-your-own-related-telemetry.html)
in the I<CloudWatch User Guide>.
