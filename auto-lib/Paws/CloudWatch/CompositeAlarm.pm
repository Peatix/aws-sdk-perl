=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionsEnabled => $value, ..., StateValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionsEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details about a composite alarm.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActionsEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the
alarm state.


=head2 ActionsSuppressedBy => Str

When the value is C<ALARM>, it means that the actions are suppressed
because the suppressor alarm is in C<ALARM> When the value is
C<WaitPeriod>, it means that the actions are suppressed because the
composite alarm is waiting for the suppressor alarm to go into into the
C<ALARM> state. The maximum waiting time is as specified in
C<ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod>. After this time, the composite alarm
performs its actions. When the value is C<ExtensionPeriod>, it means
that the actions are suppressed because the composite alarm is waiting
after the suppressor alarm went out of the C<ALARM> state. The maximum
waiting time is as specified in C<ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod>.
After this time, the composite alarm performs its actions.


=head2 ActionsSuppressedReason => Str

Captures the reason for action suppression.


=head2 ActionsSuppressor => Str

Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the C<ALARM>
state. C<ActionsSuppressor> can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.


=head2 ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod => Int

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits after
suppressor alarm goes out of the C<ALARM> state. After this time, the
composite alarm performs its actions.

C<ExtensionPeriod> is required only when C<ActionsSuppressor> is
specified.


=head2 ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod => Int

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the
suppressor alarm to go into the C<ALARM> state. After this time, the
composite alarm performs its actions.

C<WaitPeriod> is required only when C<ActionsSuppressor> is specified.


=head2 AlarmActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the ALARM state
from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource
Name (ARN).


=head2 AlarmArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the alarm.


=head2 AlarmConfigurationUpdatedTimestamp => Str

The time stamp of the last update to the alarm configuration.


=head2 AlarmDescription => Str

The description of the alarm.


=head2 AlarmName => Str

The name of the alarm.


=head2 AlarmRule => Str

The rule that this alarm uses to evaluate its alarm state.


=head2 InsufficientDataActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the
INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state. Each action is specified
as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).


=head2 OKActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from
any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN).


=head2 StateReason => Str

An explanation for the alarm state, in text format.


=head2 StateReasonData => Str

An explanation for the alarm state, in JSON format.


=head2 StateTransitionedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of the last change to the alarm's C<StateValue>.


=head2 StateUpdatedTimestamp => Str

Tracks the timestamp of any state update, even if C<StateValue> doesn't
change.


=head2 StateValue => Str

The state value for the alarm.
