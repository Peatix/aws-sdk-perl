=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::ManagedRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ResourceARN => $value, ..., TemplateName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::ManagedRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ResourceARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the information that's required to enable a managed
Contributor Insights rule for an Amazon Web Services resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceARN => Str

The ARN of an Amazon Web Services resource that has managed Contributor
Insights rules.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatch::Tag>]

A list of key-value pairs that you can associate with a managed
Contributor Insights rule. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a
rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You
also can use them to scope user permissions by granting a user
permission to access or change only the resources that have certain tag
values. To associate tags with a rule, you must have the
C<cloudwatch:TagResource> permission in addition to the
C<cloudwatch:PutInsightRule> permission. If you are using this
operation to update an existing Contributor Insights rule, any tags
that you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of
an existing rule, use C<TagResource>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TemplateName => Str

The template name for the managed Contributor Insights rule, as
returned by C<ListManagedInsightRules>.
