=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricNames => $value, ..., Namespace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains a metric namespace and optionally, a list of
metric names, to either include in a metric stream or exclude from a
metric stream.

A metric stream's filters can include up to 1000 total names. This
limit applies to the sum of namespace names and metric names in the
filters. For example, this could include 10 metric namespace filters
with 99 metrics each, or 20 namespace filters with 49 metrics specified
in each filter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names of the metrics to either include or exclude from the metric
stream.

If you omit this parameter, all metrics in the namespace are included
or excluded, depending on whether this filter is specified as an
exclude filter or an include filter.

Each metric name can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII
range 32 through 126). Each metric name must contain at least one
non-whitespace character.


=head2 Namespace => Str

The name of the metric namespace for this filter.

The namespace can contain only ASCII printable characters (ASCII range
32 through 126). It must contain at least one non-whitespace character.
