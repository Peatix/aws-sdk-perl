=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamStatisticsConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamStatisticsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalStatistics => $value, ..., IncludeMetrics => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamStatisticsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalStatistics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, a metric stream always sends the C<MAX>, C<MIN>, C<SUM>,
and C<SAMPLECOUNT> statistics for each metric that is streamed. This
structure contains information for one metric that includes additional
statistics in the stream. For more information about statistics, see
CloudWatch, listed in CloudWatch statistics definitions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AdditionalStatistics => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of additional statistics that are to be streamed for the
metrics listed in the C<IncludeMetrics> array in this structure. This
list can include as many as 20 statistics.

If the C<OutputFormat> for the stream is C<opentelemetry1.0> or
C<opentelemetry0.7>, the only valid values are C<pI<??> > percentile
statistics such as C<p90>, C<p99> and so on.

If the C<OutputFormat> for the stream is C<json>, the valid values
include the abbreviations for all of the statistics listed in
CloudWatch statistics definitions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html).
For example, this includes C<tm98, > C<wm90>, C<PR(:300)>, and so on.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IncludeMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatch::MetricStreamStatisticsMetric>]

An array of metric name and namespace pairs that stream the additional
statistics listed in the value of the C<AdditionalStatistics>
parameter. There can be as many as 100 pairs in the array.

All metrics that match the combination of metric name and namespace
will be streamed with the additional statistics, no matter their
dimensions.
