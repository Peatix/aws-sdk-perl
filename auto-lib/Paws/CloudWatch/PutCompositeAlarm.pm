Paws::CloudWatch::PutCompositeAlarm - Arguments for method PutCompositeAlarm on L<Paws::CloudWatch>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutCompositeAlarm on the
L<Amazon CloudWatch|Paws::CloudWatch> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutCompositeAlarm.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutCompositeAlarm.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActionsEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the
alarm state of the composite alarm. The default is C<TRUE>.



=head2 ActionsSuppressor => Str

Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the C<ALARM>
state. C<ActionsSuppressor> can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.



=head2 ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod => Int

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits after
suppressor alarm goes out of the C<ALARM> state. After this time, the
composite alarm performs its actions.

C<ExtensionPeriod> is required only when C<ActionsSuppressor> is
specified.



=head2 ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod => Int

The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the
suppressor alarm to go into the C<ALARM> state. After this time, the
composite alarm performs its actions.

C<WaitPeriod> is required only when C<ActionsSuppressor> is specified.



=head2 AlarmActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the C<ALARM>
state from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon
Resource Name (ARN).

Valid Values: ]

B<Amazon SNS actions:>

C<arn:aws:sns:I<region>:I<account-id>:I<sns-topic-name>>

B<Lambda actions:>

=over

=item *

Invoke the latest version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>>

=item *

Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<version-number>>

=item *

Invoke a function by using an alias Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<alias-name>>

=back

B<Systems Manager actions:>

C<arn:aws:ssm:I<region>:I<account-id>:opsitem:I<severity>>

B<Start a Amazon Q Developer operational investigation>

C<arn:aws:aiops:I<region>:I<account-id>:investigation-group:I<ingestigation-group-id>>



=head2 AlarmDescription => Str

The description for the composite alarm.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> AlarmName => Str

The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the
Region.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> AlarmRule => Str

An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to
determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you
reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm
needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You
can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a
single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the
functions in your expression.

You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms
that are to be evaluated.

Functions can include the following:

=over

=item *

C<ALARM("I<alarm-name> or I<alarm-ARN>")> is TRUE if the named alarm is
in ALARM state.

=item *

C<OK("I<alarm-name> or I<alarm-ARN>")> is TRUE if the named alarm is in
OK state.

=item *

C<INSUFFICIENT_DATA("I<alarm-name> or I<alarm-ARN>")> is TRUE if the
named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

=item *

C<TRUE> always evaluates to TRUE.

=item *

C<FALSE> always evaluates to FALSE.

=back

TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex C<AlarmRule> structure,
and for testing your alarm actions.

Alarm names specified in C<AlarmRule> can be surrounded with
double-quotes ("), but do not have to be.

The following are some examples of C<AlarmRule>:

=over

=item *

C<ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)> specifies
that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both
CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.

=item *

C<ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)>
specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh
is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This
example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window.

=item *

C<(ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND
OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)> goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh
OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in
OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to
prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an
alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is
also occurring.

=back

The C<AlarmRule> can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The
C<AlarmRule> expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are
child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.



=head2 InsufficientDataActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the
C<INSUFFICIENT_DATA> state from any other state. Each action is
specified as an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

Valid Values: ]

B<Amazon SNS actions:>

C<arn:aws:sns:I<region>:I<account-id>:I<sns-topic-name>>

B<Lambda actions:>

=over

=item *

Invoke the latest version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>>

=item *

Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<version-number>>

=item *

Invoke a function by using an alias Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<alias-name>>

=back




=head2 OKActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an C<OK> state
from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource
Name (ARN).

Valid Values: ]

B<Amazon SNS actions:>

C<arn:aws:sns:I<region>:I<account-id>:I<sns-topic-name>>

B<Lambda actions:>

=over

=item *

Invoke the latest version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>>

=item *

Invoke a specific version of a Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<version-number>>

=item *

Invoke a function by using an alias Lambda function:
C<arn:aws:lambda:I<region>:I<account-id>:function:I<function-name>:I<alias-name>>

=back




=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatch::Tag>]

A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can
associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm. To be able to associate
tags with the alarm when you create the alarm, you must have the
C<cloudwatch:TagResource> permission.

Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also
use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to
access or change only resources with certain tag values.

If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags
you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an
existing alarm, use TagResource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html)
or UntagResource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_UntagResource.html).
