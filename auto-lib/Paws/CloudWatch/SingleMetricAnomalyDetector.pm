=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::SingleMetricAnomalyDetector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::SingleMetricAnomalyDetector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., Stat => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::SingleMetricAnomalyDetector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Designates the CloudWatch metric and statistic that provides the time
series the anomaly detector uses as input. If you have enabled unified
cross-account observability, and this account is a monitoring account,
the metric can be in the same account or a source account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

If the CloudWatch metric that provides the time series that the anomaly
detector uses as input is in another account, specify that account ID
here. If you omit this parameter, the current account is used.


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatch::Dimension>]

The metric dimensions to create the anomaly detection model for.


=head2 MetricName => Str

The name of the metric to create the anomaly detection model for.


=head2 Namespace => Str

The namespace of the metric to create the anomaly detection model for.


=head2 Stat => Str

The statistic to use for the metric and anomaly detection model.
