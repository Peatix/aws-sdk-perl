=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudWatch::MetricMathAnomalyDetector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudWatch::MetricMathAnomalyDetector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricDataQueries => $value, ..., MetricDataQueries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudWatch::MetricMathAnomalyDetector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricDataQueries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates the CloudWatch math expression that provides the time series
the anomaly detector uses as input. The designated math expression must
return a single time series.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MetricDataQueries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudWatch::MetricDataQuery>]

An array of metric data query structures that enables you to create an
anomaly detector based on the result of a metric math expression. Each
item in C<MetricDataQueries> gets a metric or performs a math
expression. One item in C<MetricDataQueries> is the expression that
provides the time series that the anomaly detector uses as input.
Designate the expression by setting C<ReturnData> to C<true> for this
object in the array. For all other expressions and metrics, set
C<ReturnData> to C<false>. The designated expression must return a
single time series.
