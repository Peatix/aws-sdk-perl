=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteGrant on the

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $license-manager = Paws->service('LicenseManager');
    my $DeleteGrantResponse = $license -manager->DeleteGrant(
      GrantArn     => 'MyArn',
      Version      => 'MyString',
      StatusReason => 'MyStatusReasonMessage',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GrantArn = $DeleteGrantResponse->GrantArn;
    my $Status   = $DeleteGrantResponse->Status;
    my $Version  = $DeleteGrantResponse->Version;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LicenseManager::DeleteGrantResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
