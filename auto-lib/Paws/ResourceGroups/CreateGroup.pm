=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $resource-groups = Paws->service('ResourceGroups');
    my $CreateGroupOutput = $resource -groups->CreateGroup(
      Name          => 'MyCreateGroupName',
      Configuration => [
        {
          Type       => 'MyGroupConfigurationType',    # max: 40
          Parameters => [
            {
              Name   => 'MyGroupConfigurationParameterName',   # min: 1, max: 80
              Values => [
                'MyGroupConfigurationParameterValue', ...    # min: 1, max: 256
              ],    # OPTIONAL
            },
            ...
          ],    # OPTIONAL

        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      Criticality   => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      Description   => 'MyDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      DisplayName   => 'MyDisplayName',    # OPTIONAL
      Owner         => 'MyOwner',          # OPTIONAL
      ResourceQuery => {
        Query => 'MyQuery',                # max: 4096
        Type  => 'TAG_FILTERS_1_0'
        ,    # values: TAG_FILTERS_1_0, CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0min: 1, max: 128

      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Group              = $CreateGroupOutput->Group;
    my $GroupConfiguration = $CreateGroupOutput->GroupConfiguration;
    my $ResourceQuery      = $CreateGroupOutput->ResourceQuery;
    my $Tags               = $CreateGroupOutput->Tags;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ResourceGroups::CreateGroupOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Configuration => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ResourceGroups::GroupConfigurationItem>]

A configuration associates the resource group with an Amazon Web
Services service and specifies how the service can interact with the
resources in the group. A configuration is an array of
GroupConfigurationItem elements. For details about the syntax of
service configurations, see Service configurations for Resource Groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html).

A resource group can contain either a C<Configuration> or a
C<ResourceQuery>, but not both.



=head2 Criticality => Int

The critical rank of the application group on a scale of 1 to 10, with
a rank of 1 being the most critical, and a rank of 10 being least
critical.



=head2 Description => Str

The description of the resource group. Descriptions can consist of
letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, periods, and spaces.



=head2 DisplayName => Str

The name of the application group, which you can change at any time.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the group, which is the identifier of the group in other
operations. You can't change the name of a resource group after you
create it. A resource group name can consist of letters, numbers,
hyphens, periods, and underscores. The name cannot start with C<AWS>,
C<aws>, or any other possible capitalization; these are reserved. A
resource group name must be unique within each Amazon Web Services
Region in your Amazon Web Services account.



=head2 Owner => Str

A name, email address or other identifier for the person or group who
is considered as the owner of this application group within your
organization.



=head2 ResourceQuery => L<Paws::ResourceGroups::ResourceQuery>

The resource query that determines which Amazon Web Services resources
are members of this group. For more information about resource queries,
see Create a tag-based group in Resource Groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#gettingstarted-query-cli-tag).

A resource group can contain either a C<ResourceQuery> or a
C<Configuration>, but not both.



=head2 Tags => L<Paws::ResourceGroups::Tags>

The tags to add to the group. A tag is key-value pair string.
