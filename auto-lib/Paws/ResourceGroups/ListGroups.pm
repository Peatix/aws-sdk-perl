=head1 NAME

Paws::ResourceGroups::ListGroups - Arguments for method ListGroups on L<Paws::ResourceGroups>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListGroups on the
L<AWS Resource Groups|Paws::ResourceGroups> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListGroups.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListGroups.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $resource-groups = Paws->service('ResourceGroups');
    my $ListGroupsOutput = $resource -groups->ListGroups(
      Filters => [
        {
          Name => 'resource-type'
          , # values: resource-type, configuration-type, owner, display-name, criticality
          Values => [
            'MyGroupFilterValue', ...    # min: 1, max: 300
          ],    # min: 1, max: 5

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GroupIdentifiers = $ListGroupsOutput->GroupIdentifiers;
    my $Groups           = $ListGroupsOutput->Groups;
    my $NextToken        = $ListGroupsOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ResourceGroups::ListGroupsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/resource-groups/ListGroups>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ResourceGroups::GroupFilter>]

Filters, formatted as GroupFilter objects, that you want to apply to a
C<ListGroups> operation.

=over

=item *

C<resource-type> - Filter the results to include only those resource
groups that have the specified resource type in their
C<ResourceTypeFilter>. For example, C<AWS::EC2::Instance> would return
any resource group with a C<ResourceTypeFilter> that includes
C<AWS::EC2::Instance>.

=item *

C<configuration-type> - Filter the results to include only those groups
that have the specified configuration types attached. The current
supported values are:

=over

=item *

C<AWS::ResourceGroups::ApplicationGroup>

=item *

C<AWS::AppRegistry::Application>

=item *

C<AWS::AppRegistry::ApplicationResourceGroup>

=item *

C<AWS::CloudFormation::Stack>

=item *

C<AWS::EC2::CapacityReservationPool>

=item *

C<AWS::EC2::HostManagement>

=item *

C<AWS::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroup>

=head2 MaxResults => Int

The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value
that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the C<NextToken> response element is present and
has a value (is not null). Include that value as the C<NextToken>
request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next
part of the results. Note that the service might return fewer results
than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should
check C<NextToken> after every operation to ensure that you receive all
of the results.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
C<NextToken> response in a previous request. A C<NextToken> response
indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the
value provided by a previous call's C<NextToken> response to indicate
where the output should continue from.
