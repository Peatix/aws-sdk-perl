=head1 NAME

Paws::ResourceGroups::GroupConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ResourceGroups::GroupConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Configuration => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ResourceGroups::GroupConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A service configuration associated with a resource group. The
configuration options are determined by the Amazon Web Services service
that defines the C<Type>, and specifies which resources can be included
in the group. You can add a service configuration when you create the
group by using CreateGroup, or later by using the PutGroupConfiguration
operation. For details about group service configuration syntax, see
Service configurations for resource groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/APIReference/about-slg.html).
