=head1 NAME

Paws::EBS::StartSnapshot - Arguments for method StartSnapshot on L<Paws::EBS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StartSnapshot on the
L<Amazon Elastic Block Store|Paws::EBS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StartSnapshot.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StartSnapshot.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ebs = Paws->service('EBS');
    my $StartSnapshotResponse = $ebs->StartSnapshot(
      VolumeSize       => 1,
      ClientToken      => 'MyIdempotencyToken',    # OPTIONAL
      Description      => 'MyDescription',         # OPTIONAL
      Encrypted        => 1,                       # OPTIONAL
      KmsKeyArn        => 'MyKmsKeyArn',           # OPTIONAL
      ParentSnapshotId => 'MySnapshotId',          # OPTIONAL
      Tags             => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # max: 127; OPTIONAL
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 255; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      Timeout => 1,    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $BlockSize        = $StartSnapshotResponse->BlockSize;
    my $Description      = $StartSnapshotResponse->Description;
    my $KmsKeyArn        = $StartSnapshotResponse->KmsKeyArn;
    my $OwnerId          = $StartSnapshotResponse->OwnerId;
    my $ParentSnapshotId = $StartSnapshotResponse->ParentSnapshotId;
    my $SnapshotId       = $StartSnapshotResponse->SnapshotId;
    my $SseType          = $StartSnapshotResponse->SseType;
    my $StartTime        = $StartSnapshotResponse->StartTime;
    my $Status           = $StartSnapshotResponse->Status;
    my $Tags             = $StartSnapshotResponse->Tags;
    my $VolumeSize       = $StartSnapshotResponse->VolumeSize;

    # Returns a L<Paws::EBS::StartSnapshotResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
idempotency of the request. Idempotency ensures that an API request
completes only once. With an idempotent request, if the original
request completes successfully. The subsequent retries with the same
client token return the result from the original successful request and
they have no additional effect.

If you do not specify a client token, one is automatically generated by
the Amazon Web Services SDK.

For more information, see Idempotency for StartSnapshot API
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-direct-api-idempotency.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.



=head2 Description => Str

A description for the snapshot.



=head2 Encrypted => Bool

Indicates whether to encrypt the snapshot.

You can't specify B<Encrypted> and B< ParentSnapshotId> in the same
request. If you specify both parameters, the request fails with
C<ValidationException>.

The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
specify for B<Encrypted>, B<KmsKeyArn>, and B<ParentSnapshotId>, and
whether your Amazon Web Services account is enabled for encryption by
default
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default).
For more information, see Using encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapis-using-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.

To create an encrypted snapshot, you must have permission to use the
KMS key. For more information, see Permissions to use Key Management
Service keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapi-permissions.html#ebsapi-kms-permissions)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.



=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) key
to be used to encrypt the snapshot.

The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
specify for B<Encrypted>, B<KmsKeyArn>, and B<ParentSnapshotId>, and
whether your Amazon Web Services account is enabled for encryption by
default
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default).
For more information, see Using encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapis-using-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.

To create an encrypted snapshot, you must have permission to use the
KMS key. For more information, see Permissions to use Key Management
Service keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapi-permissions.html#ebsapi-kms-permissions)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.



=head2 ParentSnapshotId => Str

The ID of the parent snapshot. If there is no parent snapshot, or if
you are creating the first snapshot for an on-premises volume, omit
this parameter.

You can't specify B<ParentSnapshotId> and B<Encrypted> in the same
request. If you specify both parameters, the request fails with
C<ValidationException>.

The encryption status of the snapshot depends on the values that you
specify for B<Encrypted>, B<KmsKeyArn>, and B<ParentSnapshotId>, and
whether your Amazon Web Services account is enabled for encryption by
default
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html#encryption-by-default).
For more information, see Using encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapis-using-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.

If you specify an encrypted parent snapshot, you must have permission
to use the KMS key that was used to encrypt the parent snapshot. For
more information, see Permissions to use Key Management Service keys
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebsapi-permissions.html#ebsapi-kms-permissions)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EBS::Tag>]

The tags to apply to the snapshot.



=head2 Timeout => Int

The amount of time (in minutes) after which the snapshot is
automatically cancelled if:

=over

=item *

No blocks are written to the snapshot.

=item *

The snapshot is not completed after writing the last block of data.

=back

If no value is specified, the timeout defaults to C<60> minutes.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeSize => Int

The size of the volume, in GiB. The maximum size is C<65536> GiB (64
TiB).
