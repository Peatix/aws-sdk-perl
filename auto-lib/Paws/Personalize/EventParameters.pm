=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::EventParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::EventParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EventType => $value, ..., Weight => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::EventParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EventType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the parameters of events, which are used in solution
creation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EventType => Str

The name of the event type to be considered for solution creation.


=head2 EventValueThreshold => Num

The threshold of the event type. Only events with a value greater or
equal to this threshold will be considered for solution creation.


=head2 Weight => Num

The weight of the event type. A higher weight means higher importance
of the event type for the created solution.
