=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::RecommenderConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::RecommenderConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableMetadataWithRecommendations => $value, ..., TrainingDataConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::RecommenderConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableMetadataWithRecommendations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration details of the recommender.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnableMetadataWithRecommendations => Bool

Whether metadata with recommendations is enabled for the recommender.
If enabled, you can specify the columns from your Items dataset in your
request for recommendations. Amazon Personalize returns this data for
each item in the recommendation response. For information about
enabling metadata for a recommender, see Enabling metadata in
recommendations for a recommender
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/creating-recommenders.html#create-recommender-return-metadata).

If you enable metadata in recommendations, you will incur additional
costs. For more information, see Amazon Personalize pricing
(https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).


=head2 ItemExplorationConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::HyperParameters>

Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, including
C<explorationWeight> and C<explorationItemAgeCutOff>, you want to use
to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personalize uses
when recommending items. Provide C<itemExplorationConfig> data only if
your recommenders generate personalized recommendations for a user (not
popular items or similar items).


=head2 MinRecommendationRequestsPerSecond => Int

Specifies the requested minimum provisioned recommendation requests per
second that Amazon Personalize will support. A high
C<minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond> will increase your bill. We
recommend starting with 1 for C<minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond>
(the default). Track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and
increase the C<minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond> as necessary.


=head2 TrainingDataConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::TrainingDataConfig>

Specifies the training data configuration to use when creating a domain
recommender.
