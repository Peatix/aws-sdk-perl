=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersionSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersionSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationDateTime => $value, ..., TrainingType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersionSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationDateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a summary of the properties of a solution version. For a
complete listing, call the DescribeSolutionVersion
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_DescribeSolutionVersion.html)
API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that this version of a solution was
created.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If a solution version fails, the reason behind the failure.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution version was last
updated.


=head2 SolutionVersionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the solution version.

A solution version can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=back



=head2 TrainingMode => Str

The scope of training to be performed when creating the solution
version. A C<FULL> training considers all of the data in your dataset
group. An C<UPDATE> processes only the data that has changed since the
latest training. Only solution versions created with the
User-Personalization recipe can use C<UPDATE>.


=head2 TrainingType => Str

Whether the solution version was created automatically or manually.
