=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::Recommender

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::Recommender object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationDateTime => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::Recommender object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationDateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a recommendation generator for a Domain dataset group. You
create a recommender in a Domain dataset group for a specific domain
use case (domain recipe), and specify the recommender in a
GetRecommendations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_RS_GetRecommendations.html)
request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix format) that the recommender was created.


=head2 DatasetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Domain dataset group that
contains the recommender.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If a recommender fails, the reason behind the failure.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix format) that the recommender was last
updated.


=head2 LatestRecommenderUpdate => L<Paws::Personalize::RecommenderUpdateSummary>

Provides a summary of the latest updates to the recommender.


=head2 ModelMetrics => L<Paws::Personalize::Metrics>

Provides evaluation metrics that help you determine the performance of
a recommender. For more information, see Evaluating a recommender
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/evaluating-recommenders.html).


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the recommender.


=head2 RecipeArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe (Domain dataset group use
case) that the recommender was created for.


=head2 RecommenderArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender.


=head2 RecommenderConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::RecommenderConfig>

The configuration details of the recommender.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the recommender.

A recommender can be in one of the following states:
