=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::DatasetExportJob

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::DatasetExportJob object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationDateTime => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::DatasetExportJob object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationDateTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a job that exports a dataset to an Amazon S3 bucket. For more
information, see CreateDatasetExportJob
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_CreateDatasetExportJob.html).

=back


=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The creation date and time (in Unix time) of the dataset export job.


=head2 DatasetArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset to export.


=head2 DatasetExportJobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset export job.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If a dataset export job fails, provides the reason why.


=head2 IngestionMode => Str

The data to export, based on how you imported the data. You can choose

PutEvents, PutUsers and PutItems operations), or C<ALL> for both types.
The default value is C<PUT>.


=head2 JobName => Str

The name of the export job.


=head2 JobOutput => L<Paws::Personalize::DatasetExportJobOutput>

The path to the Amazon S3 bucket where the job's output is stored. For
example:

C<s3://bucket-name/folder-name/>


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) the status of the dataset export job
was last updated.
