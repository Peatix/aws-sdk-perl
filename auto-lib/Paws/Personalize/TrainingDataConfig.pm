  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExcludedDatasetColumns => $value, ..., ExcludedDatasetColumns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::TrainingDataConfig object:

recommender or custom solution version (trained model).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExcludedDatasetColumns => L<Paws::Personalize::ExcludedDatasetColumns>

Specifies the columns to exclude from training. Each key is a dataset
type, and each value is a list of columns. Exclude columns to control
what data Amazon Personalize uses to generate recommendations.

For example, you might have a column that you want to use only to
filter recommendations. You can exclude this column from training and
Amazon Personalize considers it only when filtering.
