=head1 NAME

Paws::Personalize::Solution

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Personalize::Solution object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoMLResult => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Personalize::Solution object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoMLResult

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, all new solutions use automatic training. With automatic
training, you incur training costs while your solution is active. To
avoid unnecessary costs, when you are finished you can update the
solution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UpdateSolution.html)
to turn off automatic training. For information about training costs,
see Amazon Personalize pricing
(https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/pricing/).

An object that provides information about a solution. A solution
includes the custom recipe, customized parameters, and trained models
(Solution Versions) that Amazon Personalize uses to generate
recommendations.

After you create a solution, you canE<rsquo>t change its configuration.
If you need to make changes, you can clone the solution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/cloning-solution.html)
with the Amazon Personalize console or create a new one.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoMLResult => L<Paws::Personalize::AutoMLResult>

When C<performAutoML> is true, specifies the best recipe found.


=head2 CreationDateTime => Str

The creation date and time (in Unix time) of the solution.


=head2 DatasetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides the
training data.


=head2 EventType => Str

The event type (for example, 'click' or 'like') that is used for
training the model. If no C<eventType> is provided, Amazon Personalize
uses all interactions for training with equal weight regardless of
type.


=head2 LastUpdatedDateTime => Str

The date and time (in Unix time) that the solution was last updated.


=head2 LatestSolutionUpdate => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionUpdateSummary>

Provides a summary of the latest updates to the solution.


=head2 LatestSolutionVersion => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionVersionSummary>

Describes the latest version of the solution, including the status and
the ARN.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the solution.


=head2 PerformAutoML => Bool

We don't recommend enabling automated machine learning. Instead, match
your use case to the available Amazon Personalize recipes. For more
information, see Determining your use case.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/determining-use-case.html)

When true, Amazon Personalize performs a search for the best
USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe from the list specified in the solution
configuration (C<recipeArn> must not be specified). When false (the
default), Amazon Personalize uses C<recipeArn> for training.


=head2 PerformAutoTraining => Bool

Specifies whether the solution automatically creates solution versions.
The default is C<True> and the solution automatically creates new
solution versions every 7 days.

For more information about auto training, see Creating and configuring
a solution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/customizing-solution-config.html).


=head2 PerformHPO => Bool

Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on the chosen
recipe. The default is C<false>.


=head2 RecipeArn => Str

The ARN of the recipe used to create the solution. This is required
when C<performAutoML> is false.


=head2 SolutionArn => Str

The ARN of the solution.


=head2 SolutionConfig => L<Paws::Personalize::SolutionConfig>

Describes the configuration properties for the solution.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the solution.

A solution can be in one of the following states:

=over

=item *

CREATE PENDING E<gt> CREATE IN_PROGRESS E<gt> ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

=item *

DELETE PENDING E<gt> DELETE IN_PROGRESS

=back
