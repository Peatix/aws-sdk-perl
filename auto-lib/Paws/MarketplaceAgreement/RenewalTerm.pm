=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines that on graceful expiration of the agreement (when the
agreement ends on its pre-defined end date), a new agreement will be
created using the accepted terms on the existing agreement. In other
words, the agreement will be renewed. The presence of C<RenewalTerm> in
the offer document means that auto-renewal is allowed. Buyers will have
the option to accept or decline auto-renewal at the offer
acceptance/agreement creation. Buyers can also change this flag from
C<True> to C<False> or C<False> to C<True> at anytime during the
agreement's lifecycle.
