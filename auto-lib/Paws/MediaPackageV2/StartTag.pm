=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaPackageV2::StartTag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaPackageV2::StartTag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Precise => $value, ..., TimeOffset => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaPackageV2::StartTag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Precise

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To insert an EXT-X-START tag in your HLS playlist, specify a StartTag
configuration object with a valid TimeOffset. When you do, you can also
optionally specify whether to include a PRECISE value in the
EXT-X-START tag.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Precise => Bool

Specify the value for PRECISE within your EXT-X-START tag. Leave blank,
or choose false, to use the default value NO. Choose yes to use the
value YES.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeOffset => Num

Specify the value for TIME-OFFSET within your EXT-X-START tag. Enter a
signed floating point value which, if positive, must be less than the
configured manifest duration minus three times the configured segment
target duration. If negative, the absolute value must be larger than
three times the configured segment target duration, and the absolute
value must be smaller than the configured manifest duration.
