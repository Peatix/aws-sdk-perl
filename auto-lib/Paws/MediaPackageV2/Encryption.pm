=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaPackageV2::Encryption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaPackageV2::Encryption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConstantInitializationVector => $value, ..., SpekeKeyProvider => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaPackageV2::Encryption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConstantInitializationVector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters for encrypting content.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConstantInitializationVector => Str

A 128-bit, 16-byte hex value represented by a 32-character string, used
in conjunction with the key for encrypting content. If you don't
specify a value, then MediaPackage creates the constant initialization
vector (IV).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncryptionMethod => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::EncryptionMethod>

The encryption method to use.


=head2 KeyRotationIntervalSeconds => Int

The frequency (in seconds) of key changes for live workflows, in which
content is streamed real time. The service retrieves content keys
before the live content begins streaming, and then retrieves them as
needed over the lifetime of the workflow. By default, key rotation is
set to 300 seconds (5 minutes), the minimum rotation interval, which is
equivalent to setting it to 300. If you don't enter an interval,
content keys aren't rotated.

The following example setting causes the service to rotate keys every
thirty minutes: C<1800>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SpekeKeyProvider => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::SpekeKeyProvider>

The parameters for the SPEKE key provider.
