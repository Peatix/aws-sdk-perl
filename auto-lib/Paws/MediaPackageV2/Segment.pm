=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaPackageV2::Segment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaPackageV2::Segment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Encryption => $value, ..., TsUseAudioRenditionGroup => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaPackageV2::Segment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Encryption

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The segment configuration, including the segment name, duration, and
other configuration values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Encryption => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::Encryption>




=head2 IncludeIframeOnlyStreams => Bool

When selected, the stream set includes an additional I-frame only
stream, along with the other tracks. If false, this extra stream is not
included. MediaPackage generates an I-frame only stream from the first
rendition in the manifest. The service inserts EXT-I-FRAMES-ONLY tags
in the output manifest, and then generates and includes an I-frames
only playlist in the stream. This playlist permits player functionality
like fast forward and rewind.


=head2 Scte => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::Scte>

The SCTE configuration options in the segment settings.


=head2 SegmentDurationSeconds => Int

The duration (in seconds) of each segment. Enter a value equal to, or a
multiple of, the input segment duration. If the value that you enter is
different from the input segment duration, MediaPackage rounds segments
to the nearest multiple of the input segment duration.


=head2 SegmentName => Str

The name that describes the segment. The name is the base name of the
segment used in all content manifests inside of the endpoint. You can't
use spaces in the name.


=head2 TsIncludeDvbSubtitles => Bool

By default, MediaPackage excludes all digital video broadcasting (DVB)
subtitles from the output. When selected, MediaPackage passes through
DVB subtitles into the output.


=head2 TsUseAudioRenditionGroup => Bool

When selected, MediaPackage bundles all audio tracks in a rendition
group. All other tracks in the stream can be used with any audio
rendition from the group.
