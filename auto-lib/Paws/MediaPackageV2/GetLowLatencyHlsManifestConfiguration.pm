=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaPackageV2::GetLowLatencyHlsManifestConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaPackageV2::GetLowLatencyHlsManifestConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChildManifestName => $value, ..., UrlEncodeChildManifest => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaPackageV2::GetLowLatencyHlsManifestConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChildManifestName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Retrieve the low-latency HTTP live streaming (HLS) manifest
configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChildManifestName => Str

A short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The child manifest
name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you don't enter a
value, MediaPackage uses the default child manifest name, index_1. The
manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the manifestName you
provided on the originEndpoint object.


=head2 FilterConfiguration => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::FilterConfiguration>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> ManifestName => Str

A short short string that's appended to the endpoint URL. The manifest
name creates a unique path to this endpoint. If you don't enter a
value, MediaPackage uses the default manifest name, index. MediaPackage
automatically inserts the format extension, such as .m3u8. You can't
use the same manifest name if you use HLS manifest and low-latency HLS
manifest. The manifestName on the HLSManifest object overrides the
manifestName you provided on the originEndpoint object.


=head2 ManifestWindowSeconds => Int

The total duration (in seconds) of the manifest's content.


=head2 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds => Int

Inserts EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags in the output manifest at the
interval that you specify. If you don't enter an interval,
EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags aren't included in the manifest. The tags
sync the stream to the wall clock so that viewers can seek to a
specific time in the playback timeline on the player.

Irrespective of this parameter, if any ID3Timed metadata is in the HLS
input, it is passed through to the HLS output.


=head2 ScteHls => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::ScteHls>




=head2 StartTag => L<Paws::MediaPackageV2::StartTag>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Url => Str

The egress domain URL for stream delivery from MediaPackage.


=head2 UrlEncodeChildManifest => Bool

When enabled, MediaPackage URL-encodes the query string for API
requests for LL-HLS child manifests to comply with Amazon Web Services
Signature Version 4 (SigV4) signature signing protocol. For more
information, see Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4 for API
requests
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_sigv.html)
in I<Identity and Access Management User Guide>.
