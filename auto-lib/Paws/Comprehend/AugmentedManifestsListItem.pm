=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::AugmentedManifestsListItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::AugmentedManifestsListItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnnotationDataS3Uri => $value, ..., Split => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::AugmentedManifestsListItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnnotationDataS3Uri

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An augmented manifest file that provides training data for your custom
model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is produced
by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnnotationDataS3Uri => Str

The S3 prefix to the annotation files that are referred in the
augmented manifest file.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The JSON attribute that contains the annotations for your training
documents. The number of attribute names that you specify depends on
whether your augmented manifest file is the output of a single labeling
job or a chained labeling job.

If your file is the output of a single labeling job, specify the
LabelAttributeName key that was used when the job was created in Ground
Truth.

If your file is the output of a chained labeling job, specify the
LabelAttributeName key for one or more jobs in the chain. Each
LabelAttributeName key provides the annotations from an individual job.


=head2 DocumentType => Str

The type of augmented manifest. PlainTextDocument or
SemiStructuredDocument. If you don't specify, the default is
PlainTextDocument.

=over

=item *

C<PLAIN_TEXT_DOCUMENT> A document type that represents any unicode text
that is encoded in UTF-8.

=item *

C<SEMI_STRUCTURED_DOCUMENT> A document type with positional and
structural context, like a PDF. For training with Amazon Comprehend,
only PDFs are supported. For inference, Amazon Comprehend support PDFs,
DOCX and TXT.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 location of the augmented manifest file.


=head2 SourceDocumentsS3Uri => Str

The S3 prefix to the source files (PDFs) that are referred to in the
augmented manifest file.


=head2 Split => Str

The purpose of the data you've provided in the augmented manifest. You
can either train or test this data. If you don't specify, the default
is train.

TRAIN - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for training.
If no test documents are provided, Amazon Comprehend will automatically
reserve a portion of the training documents for testing.

TEST - all of the documents in the manifest will be used for testing.
