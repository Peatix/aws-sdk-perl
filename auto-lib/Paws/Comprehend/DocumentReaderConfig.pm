This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DocumentReadAction => $value, ..., FeatureTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::DocumentReaderConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DocumentReadAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides configuration parameters to override the default actions for
extracting text from PDF documents and image files.

By default, Amazon Comprehend performs the following actions to extract
text from files, based on the input file type:

=over

=item *

B<Word files> - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text.

=item *

B<Digital PDF files> - Amazon Comprehend parser extracts the text.

=item *

B<Image files and scanned PDF files> - Amazon Comprehend uses the
Amazon Textract C<DetectDocumentText> API to extract the text.

=back

C<DocumentReaderConfig> does not apply to plain text files or Word
files.

For image files and PDF documents, you can override these default
actions using the fields listed below. For more information, see
Setting text extraction options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/idp-set-textract-options.html)
