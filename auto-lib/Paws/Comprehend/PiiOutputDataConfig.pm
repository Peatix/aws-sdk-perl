=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::PiiOutputDataConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::PiiOutputDataConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyId => $value, ..., S3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::PiiOutputDataConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides configuration parameters for the output of PII entity
detection jobs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

ID for the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) key that
Amazon Comprehend uses to encrypt the output results from an analysis
job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

When you use the C<PiiOutputDataConfig> object with asynchronous
operations, you specify the Amazon S3 location where you want to write
the output data.

For a PII entity detection job, the output file is plain text, not a
compressed archive. The output file name is the same as the input file,
with C<.out> appended at the end.
