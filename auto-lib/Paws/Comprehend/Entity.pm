=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::Entity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::Entity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BeginOffset => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::Entity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BeginOffset

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about an entity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BeginOffset => Int

The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source text to the
first character in the entity.

This field is empty for non-text input.


=head2 BlockReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Comprehend::BlockReference>]

A reference to each block for this entity. This field is empty for
plain-text input.


=head2 EndOffset => Int

The zero-based offset from the beginning of the source text to the last
character in the entity.

This field is empty for non-text input.


=head2 Score => Num

The level of confidence that Amazon Comprehend has in the accuracy of
the detection.


=head2 Text => Str

The text of the entity.


=head2 Type => Str

The entity type. For entity detection using the built-in model, this
field contains one of the standard entity types listed below.

For custom entity detection, this field contains one of the entity
types that you specified when you trained your custom model.
