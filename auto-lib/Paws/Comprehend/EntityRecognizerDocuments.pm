  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InputFormat => $value, ..., TestS3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::EntityRecognizerDocuments object:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InputFormat => Str

Specifies how the text in an input file should be processed. This is
optional, and the default is ONE_DOC_PER_LINE. ONE_DOC_PER_FILE - Each
file is considered a separate document. Use this option when you are
processing large documents, such as newspaper articles or scientific
papers. ONE_DOC_PER_LINE - Each line in a file is considered a separate
document. Use this option when you are processing many short documents,
such as text messages.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the training documents for an
entity recognizer are located. The URI must be in the same Region as
the API endpoint that you are calling.


=head2 TestS3Uri => Str

Specifies the Amazon S3 location where the test documents for an entity
recognizer are located. The URI must be in the same Amazon Web Services
