=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::BoundingBox

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::BoundingBox object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Height => $value, ..., Width => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::BoundingBox object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Height

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The bounding box around the detected page or around an element on a
document page. The left (x-coordinate) and top (y-coordinate) are
coordinates that represent the top and left sides of the bounding box.
Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).

For additional information, see BoundingBox
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/API_BoundingBox.html)
in the Amazon Textract API reference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Height => Num

The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page
height.


=head2 Left => Num

The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document
page width.


=head2 Top => Num

The top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall document
page height.


=head2 Width => Num

The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the overall document page
width.
