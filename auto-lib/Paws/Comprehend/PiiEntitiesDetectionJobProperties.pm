=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataAccessRoleArn => $value, ..., SubmitTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::PiiEntitiesDetectionJobProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataAccessRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about a PII entities detection job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataAccessRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants Amazon
Comprehend read access to your input data.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The time that the PII entities detection job completed.


=head2 InputDataConfig => L<Paws::Comprehend::InputDataConfig>

The input properties for a PII entities detection job.


=head2 JobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the PII entities detection job. It is
a unique, fully qualified identifier for the job. It includes the
Amazon Web Services account, Amazon Web Services Region, and the job
ID. The format of the ARN is as follows:

C<arn:E<lt>partitionE<gt>:comprehend:E<lt>regionE<gt>:E<lt>account-idE<gt>:pii-entities-detection-job/E<lt>job-idE<gt>>

The following is an example job ARN:

C<arn:aws:comprehend:us-west-2:111122223333:pii-entities-detection-job/1234abcd12ab34cd56ef1234567890ab>


=head2 JobId => Str

The identifier assigned to the PII entities detection job.


=head2 JobName => Str

The name that you assigned the PII entities detection job.


=head2 JobStatus => Str

The current status of the PII entities detection job. If the status is
C<FAILED>, the C<Message> field shows the reason for the failure.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code of the input documents.


=head2 Message => Str

A description of the status of a job.


=head2 Mode => Str

Specifies whether the output provides the locations (offsets) of PII
entities or a file in which PII entities are redacted.


=head2 OutputDataConfig => L<Paws::Comprehend::PiiOutputDataConfig>

The output data configuration that you supplied when you created the
PII entities detection job.


=head2 RedactionConfig => L<Paws::Comprehend::RedactionConfig>

Provides configuration parameters for PII entity redaction.

This parameter is required if you set the C<Mode> parameter to
C<ONLY_REDACTION>. In that case, you must provide a C<RedactionConfig>
definition that includes the C<PiiEntityTypes> parameter.


=head2 SubmitTime => Str

The time that the PII entities detection job was submitted for
processing.
