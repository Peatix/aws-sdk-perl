=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::DocumentClassifierInputDataConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::DocumentClassifierInputDataConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AugmentedManifests => $value, ..., TestS3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::DocumentClassifierInputDataConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AugmentedManifests

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The input properties for training a document classifier.

For more information on how the input file is formatted, see Preparing
training data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/prep-classifier-data.html)
in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AugmentedManifests => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Comprehend::AugmentedManifestsListItem>]

A list of augmented manifest files that provide training data for your
custom model. An augmented manifest file is a labeled dataset that is
produced by Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.

This parameter is required if you set C<DataFormat> to
C<AUGMENTED_MANIFEST>.


=head2 DataFormat => Str

The format of your training data:

=over

=item *

C<COMPREHEND_CSV>: A two-column CSV file, where labels are provided in
the first column, and documents are provided in the second. If you use
this value, you must provide the C<S3Uri> parameter in your request.

=item *

C<AUGMENTED_MANIFEST>: A labeled dataset that is produced by Amazon
SageMaker Ground Truth. This file is in JSON lines format. Each line is
a complete JSON object that contains a training document and its
associated labels.

If you use this value, you must provide the C<AugmentedManifests>
parameter in your request.

=back

If you don't specify a value, Amazon Comprehend uses C<COMPREHEND_CSV>
as the default.


=head2 DocumentReaderConfig => L<Paws::Comprehend::DocumentReaderConfig>




=head2 Documents => L<Paws::Comprehend::DocumentClassifierDocuments>

The S3 location of the training documents. This parameter is required
in a request to create a native document model.


=head2 DocumentType => Str

The type of input documents for training the model. Provide plain-text
documents to create a plain-text model, and provide semi-structured
documents to create a native document model.


=head2 LabelDelimiter => Str

Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training a
multi-label classifier. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe
(|). You can use a different character as a delimiter (if it's an
allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for labels. If the
training documents use a delimiter other than the default or the
delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will be combined to make
a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.


=head2 S3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be in the same
Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a
single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of
input files.

For example, if you use the URI C<S3://bucketName/prefix>, if the
prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If
more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all
of them as input.

This parameter is required if you set C<DataFormat> to
C<COMPREHEND_CSV>.


=head2 TestS3Uri => Str

This specifies the Amazon S3 location that contains the test
annotations for the document classifier. The URI must be in the same
Amazon Web Services Region as the API endpoint that you are calling.
