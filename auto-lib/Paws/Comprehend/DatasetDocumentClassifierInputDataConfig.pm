=head1 NAME

Paws::Comprehend::DatasetDocumentClassifierInputDataConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Comprehend::DatasetDocumentClassifierInputDataConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LabelDelimiter => $value, ..., S3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Comprehend::DatasetDocumentClassifierInputDataConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LabelDelimiter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the dataset input data configuration for a document
classifier model.

For more information on how the input file is formatted, see Preparing
training data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/prep-classifier-data.html)
in the Comprehend Developer Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LabelDelimiter => Str

Indicates the delimiter used to separate each label for training a
multi-label classifier. The default delimiter between labels is a pipe
(|). You can use a different character as a delimiter (if it's an
allowed character) by specifying it under Delimiter for labels. If the
training documents use a delimiter other than the default or the
delimiter you specify, the labels on that line will be combined to make
a single unique label, such as LABELLABELLABEL.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 URI for the input data. The S3 bucket must be in the same
Region as the API endpoint that you are calling. The URI can point to a
single input file or it can provide the prefix for a collection of
input files.

For example, if you use the URI C<S3://bucketName/prefix>, if the
prefix is a single file, Amazon Comprehend uses that file as input. If
more than one file begins with the prefix, Amazon Comprehend uses all
of them as input.

This parameter is required if you set C<DataFormat> to
C<COMPREHEND_CSV>.
