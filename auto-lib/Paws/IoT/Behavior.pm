=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::Behavior

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::Behavior object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Criteria => $value, ..., SuppressAlerts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::Behavior object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Criteria

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Device Defender security profile behavior.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Criteria => L<Paws::IoT::BehaviorCriteria>

The criteria that determine if a device is behaving normally in regard
to the C<metric>.

In the IoT console, you can choose to be sent an alert through Amazon
SNS when IoT Device Defender detects that a device is behaving
anomalously.


=head2 ExportMetric => Bool

Value indicates exporting metrics related to the behavior when it is
true.


=head2 Metric => Str

What is measured by the behavior.


=head2 MetricDimension => L<Paws::IoT::MetricDimension>

The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example, using a
C<TOPIC_FILTER> dimension, you can narrow down the scope of the metric
to only MQTT topics where the name matches the pattern specified in the
dimension. This can't be used with custom metrics.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name you've given to the behavior.


=head2 SuppressAlerts => Bool

Suppresses alerts.



=head1 SEE ALSO
