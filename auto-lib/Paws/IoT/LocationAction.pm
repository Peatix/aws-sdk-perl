=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::LocationAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::LocationAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeviceId => $value, ..., TrackerName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::LocationAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeviceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Amazon Location rule action sends device location updates from an
MQTT message to an Amazon Location tracker resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeviceId => Str

The unique ID of the device providing the location data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Latitude => Str

A string that evaluates to a double value that represents the latitude
of the device's location.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Longitude => Str

A string that evaluates to a double value that represents the longitude
of the device's location.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The IAM role that grants permission to write to the Amazon Location
resource.


=head2 Timestamp => L<Paws::IoT::LocationTimestamp>

The time that the location data was sampled. The default value is the
time the MQTT message was processed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrackerName => Str

The name of the tracker resource in Amazon Location in which the
location is updated.
