=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::MqttHeaders

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::MqttHeaders object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContentType => $value, ..., UserProperties => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::MqttHeaders object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContentType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies MQTT Version 5.0 headers information. For more information,
see MQTT
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html) from
Amazon Web Services IoT Core Developer Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContentType => Str

A UTF-8 encoded string that describes the content of the publishing
message.

For more information, see Content Type
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901118)
from the MQTT Version 5.0 specification.

Supports substitution templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).


=head2 CorrelationData => Str

The base64-encoded binary data used by the sender of the request
message to identify which request the response message is for when it's
received.

For more information, see Correlation Data
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901115)
from the MQTT Version 5.0 specification.

This binary data must be based64-encoded.

Supports substitution templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).


=head2 MessageExpiry => Str

A user-defined integer value that will persist a message at the message
broker for a specified amount of time to ensure that the message will
expire if it's no longer relevant to the subscriber. The value of
C<messageExpiry> represents the number of seconds before it expires.
For more information about the limits of C<messageExpiry>, see Amazon
Web Services IoT Core message broker and protocol limits and quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/mqtt.html) from
the Amazon Web Services Reference Guide.

Supports substitution templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).


=head2 PayloadFormatIndicator => Str

An C<Enum> string value that indicates whether the payload is formatted
as UTF-8.

Valid values are C<UNSPECIFIED_BYTES> and C<UTF8_DATA>.

For more information, see Payload Format Indicator
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901111)
from the MQTT Version 5.0 specification.

Supports substitution templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).


=head2 ResponseTopic => Str

A UTF-8 encoded string that's used as the topic name for a response
message. The response topic is used to describe the topic which the
receiver should publish to as part of the request-response flow. The
topic must not contain wildcard characters.

For more information, see Response Topic
(https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901114)
from the MQTT Version 5.0 specification.

Supports substitution templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-substitution-templates.html).


=head2 UserProperties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoT::UserProperty>]

An array of key-value pairs that you define in the MQTT5 header.
