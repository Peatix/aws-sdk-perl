=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::AwsJobExponentialRolloutRate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::AwsJobExponentialRolloutRate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseRatePerMinute => $value, ..., RateIncreaseCriteria => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::AwsJobExponentialRolloutRate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseRatePerMinute

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The rate of increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows you to
define an exponential rate increase for a job rollout.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BaseRatePerMinute => Int

The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pending job,
per minute, at the start of the job rollout. This is the initial rate
of the rollout.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IncrementFactor => Num

The rate of increase for a job rollout. The number of things notified
is multiplied by this factor.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RateIncreaseCriteria => L<Paws::IoT::AwsJobRateIncreaseCriteria>

The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout for a job.

Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after the decimal
(for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).
