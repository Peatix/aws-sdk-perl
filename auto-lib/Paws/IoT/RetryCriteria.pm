=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::RetryCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::RetryCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailureType => $value, ..., NumberOfRetries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::RetryCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailureType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for each
failure type for a job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FailureType => Str

The type of job execution failures that can initiate a job retry.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NumberOfRetries => Int

The number of retries allowed for a failure type for the job.
