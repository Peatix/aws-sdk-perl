=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::SchedulingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::SchedulingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndBehavior => $value, ..., StartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::SchedulingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the date and time that a job will begin the rollout of the
job document to all devices in the target group. Additionally, you can
specify the end behavior for each job execution when it reaches the
scheduled end time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndBehavior => Str

Specifies the end behavior for all job executions after a job reaches
the selected C<endTime>. If C<endTime> is not selected when creating
the job, then C<endBehavior> does not apply.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The time a job will stop rollout of the job document to all devices in
the target group for a job. The C<endTime> must take place no later
than two years from the current time and be scheduled a minimum of
thirty minutes from the current time. The minimum duration between
C<startTime> and C<endTime> is thirty minutes. The maximum duration
between C<startTime> and C<endTime> is two years. The date and time
format for the C<endTime> is YYYY-MM-DD for the date and HH:MM for the
time.

For more information on the syntax for C<endTime> when using an API
command or the Command Line Interface, see Timestamp
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp).


=head2 MaintenanceWindows => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoT::MaintenanceWindow>]

An optional configuration within the C<SchedulingConfig> to setup a
recurring maintenance window with a predetermined start time and
duration for the rollout of a job document to all devices in a target
group for a job.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The time a job will begin rollout of the job document to all devices in
the target group for a job. The C<startTime> can be scheduled up to a
year in advance and must be scheduled a minimum of thirty minutes from
the current time. The date and time format for the C<startTime> is
YYYY-MM-DD for the date and HH:MM for the time.

For more information on the syntax for C<startTime> when using an API
command or the Command Line Interface, see Timestamp
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-types.html#parameter-type-timestamp).
