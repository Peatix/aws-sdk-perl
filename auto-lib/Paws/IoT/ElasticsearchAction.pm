=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class.

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::ElasticsearchAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Endpoint
