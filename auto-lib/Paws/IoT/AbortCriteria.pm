=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::AbortCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::AbortCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., ThresholdPercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::AbortCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The criteria that determine when and how a job abort takes place.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => Str

The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FailureType => Str

The type of job execution failures that can initiate a job abort.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinNumberOfExecutedThings => Int

The minimum number of things which must receive job execution
notifications before the job can be aborted.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ThresholdPercentage => Num

The minimum percentage of job execution failures that must occur to
initiate the job abort.

Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to two digits after the
decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not 10.999).
