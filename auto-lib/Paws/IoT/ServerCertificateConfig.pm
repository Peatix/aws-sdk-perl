=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::ServerCertificateConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::ServerCertificateConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableOCSPCheck => $value, ..., OcspLambdaArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::ServerCertificateConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableOCSPCheck

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The server certificate configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnableOCSPCheck => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) server certificate check is enabled or not.

For more information, see Server certificate configuration for OCSP
stapling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-cert-config.html)
from Amazon Web Services IoT Core Developer Guide.


=head2 OcspAuthorizedResponderArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an X.509 certificate stored in
Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager (ACM). If provided, Amazon Web
Services IoT Core will use this certificate to validate the signature
of the received OCSP response. The OCSP responder must sign responses
using either this authorized responder certificate or the issuing
certificate, depending on whether the ARN is provided or not. The
certificate must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and region
as the domain configuration.


=head2 OcspLambdaArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a Lambda function that acts as a
Request for Comments (RFC) 6960-compliant Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) responder, supporting basic OCSP responses. The Lambda
function accepts a base64-encoding of the OCSP request in the
Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format. The Lambda function's
response is also a base64-encoded OCSP response in the DER format. The
response size must not exceed 4 kilobytes (KiB). The Lambda function
must be in the same Amazon Web Services account and region as the
domain configuration. For more information, see Configuring server
certificate OCSP for private endpoints in Amazon Web Services IoT Core
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-custom-endpoints-cert-config.html#iot-custom-endpoints-cert-config-ocsp-private-endpoint.html)
from the Amazon Web Services IoT Core developer guide.
