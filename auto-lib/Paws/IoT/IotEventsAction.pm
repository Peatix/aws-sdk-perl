=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::IotEventsAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::IotEventsAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BatchMode => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::IotEventsAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BatchMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sends an input to an IoT Events detector.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BatchMode => Bool

Whether to process the event actions as a batch. The default value is
C<false>.

When C<batchMode> is C<true>, you can't specify a C<messageId>.

When C<batchMode> is C<true> and the rule SQL statement evaluates to an
Array, each Array element is treated as a separate message when it's
sent to IoT Events by calling C<BatchPutMessage>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotevents/latest/apireference/API_iotevents-data_BatchPutMessage.html).
The resulting array can't have more than 10 messages.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InputName => Str

The name of the IoT Events input.


=head2 MessageId => Str

The ID of the message. The default C<messageId> is a new UUID value.

When C<batchMode> is C<true>, you can't specify a C<messageId>--a new
UUID value will be assigned.

Assign a value to this property to ensure that only one input (message)
with a given C<messageId> will be processed by an IoT Events detector.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The ARN of the role that grants IoT permission to send an input to an
IoT Events detector. ("Action":"iotevents:BatchPutMessage").
