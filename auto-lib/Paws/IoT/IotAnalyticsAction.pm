=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::IotAnalyticsAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::IotAnalyticsAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BatchMode => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::IotAnalyticsAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BatchMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sends message data to an IoT Analytics channel.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BatchMode => Bool

Whether to process the action as a batch. The default value is
C<false>.

When C<batchMode> is C<true> and the rule SQL statement evaluates to an
Array, each Array element is delivered as a separate message when
passed by C<BatchPutMessage>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_BatchPutMessage.html)
to the IoT Analytics channel. The resulting array can't have more than
100 messages.


=head2 ChannelArn => Str

(deprecated) The ARN of the IoT Analytics channel to which message data
will be sent.


=head2 ChannelName => Str

The name of the IoT Analytics channel to which message data will be
sent.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

The ARN of the role which has a policy that grants IoT Analytics
permission to send message data via IoT Analytics
(iotanalytics:BatchPutMessage).
