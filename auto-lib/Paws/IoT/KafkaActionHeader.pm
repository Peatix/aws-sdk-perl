=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::KafkaActionHeader

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::KafkaActionHeader object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::KafkaActionHeader object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a Kafka header using key-value pairs when you create a
RuleE<rsquo>s Kafka Action. You can use these headers to route data
from IoT clients to downstream Kafka clusters without modifying your
message payload.

For more information about Rule's Kafka action, see Apache Kafka
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/apache-kafka-rule-action.html).
