=head1 NAME

Paws::IoT::IndexingFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoT::IndexingFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GeoLocations => $value, ..., NamedShadowNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoT::IndexingFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GeoLocations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides additional selections for named shadows and geolocation data.

To add named shadows to your fleet indexing configuration, set
C<namedShadowIndexingMode> to be ON and specify your shadow names in
C<namedShadowNames> filter.

To add geolocation data to your fleet indexing configuration:

=over

=item *

If you store geolocation data in a class/unnamed shadow, set
C<thingIndexingMode> to be C<REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW> and specify your
geolocation data in C<geoLocations> filter.

=item *

If you store geolocation data in a named shadow, set
C<namedShadowIndexingMode> to be C<ON>, add the shadow name in
C<namedShadowNames> filter, and specify your geolocation data in
C<geoLocations> filter. For more information, see Managing fleet
indexing

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GeoLocations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoT::GeoLocationTarget>]

The list of geolocation targets that you select to index. The default
maximum number of geolocation targets for indexing is C<1>. To increase

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot_device_management.html#fleet-indexing-limits)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.


=head2 NamedShadowNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The shadow names that you select to index. The default maximum number
of shadow names for indexing is 10. To increase the limit, see Amazon
Web Services IoT Device Management Quotas
