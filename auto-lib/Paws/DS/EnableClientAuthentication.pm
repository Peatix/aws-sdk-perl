=head1 NAME

Paws::DS::EnableClientAuthentication - Arguments for method EnableClientAuthentication on L<Paws::DS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method EnableClientAuthentication on the
L<AWS Directory Service|Paws::DS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method EnableClientAuthentication.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to EnableClientAuthentication.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ds = Paws->service('DS');
    my $EnableClientAuthenticationResult = $ds->EnableClientAuthentication(
      DirectoryId => 'MyDirectoryId',
      Type        => 'SmartCard',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/ds/EnableClientAuthentication>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DirectoryId => Str
