=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerRuntime::ResponseStream

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerRuntime::ResponseStream object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InternalStreamFailure => $value, ..., PayloadPart => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerRuntime::ResponseStream object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InternalStreamFailure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A stream of payload parts. Each part contains a portion of the response
for a streaming inference request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InternalStreamFailure => L<Paws::SageMakerRuntime::InternalStreamFailure>

The stream processing failed because of an unknown error, exception or
failure. Try your request again.


=head2 ModelStreamError => L<Paws::SageMakerRuntime::ModelStreamError>

An error occurred while streaming the response body. This error can
have the following error codes:

=over

=item ModelInvocationTimeExceeded

The model failed to finish sending the response within the timeout
period allowed by Amazon SageMaker.

=item StreamBroken

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection between the client
and the model was reset or closed.

=back



=head2 PayloadPart => L<Paws::SageMakerRuntime::PayloadPart>

A wrapper for pieces of the payload that's returned in response to a
streaming inference request. A streaming inference response consists of
one or more payload parts.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::SageMakerRuntime>
