=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::Volume

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::Volume object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EfsVolumeConfiguration => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::Volume object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EfsVolumeConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A data volume that's used in a job's container properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EfsVolumeConfiguration => L<Paws::Batch::EFSVolumeConfiguration>

This parameter is specified when you're using an Amazon Elastic File
System file system for job storage. Jobs that are running on Fargate
resources must specify a C<platformVersion> of at least C<1.4.0>.


=head2 Host => L<Paws::Batch::Host>

The contents of the C<host> parameter determine whether your data
volume persists on the host container instance and where it's stored.
If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host
path for your data volume. However, the data isn't guaranteed to
persist after the containers that are associated with it stop running.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources and shouldn't be provided.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the volume. It can be up to 255 characters long. It can
contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and
underscores (_). This name is referenced in the C<sourceVolume>
parameter of container definition C<mountPoints>.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Batch>
