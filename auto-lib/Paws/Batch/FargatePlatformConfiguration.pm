=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::FargatePlatformConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PlatformVersion => $value, ..., PlatformVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::FargatePlatformConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PlatformVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The platform configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Jobs that run on Amazon EC2 resources must not specify this
parameter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PlatformVersion => Str

The Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform
version is specified only for jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. If one isn't specified, the C<LATEST> platform version is
used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the Fargate
platform for compute resources. For more information, see Fargate
platform versions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/platform_versions.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.
