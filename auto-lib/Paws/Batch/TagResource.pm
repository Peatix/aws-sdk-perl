=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::TagResource - Arguments for method TagResource on L<Paws::Batch>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method TagResource on the
L<AWS Batch|Paws::Batch> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method TagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to TagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $batch = Paws->service('Batch');
    # TagResource Example
    # This demonstrates calling the TagResource action.
    my $TagResourceResponse = $batch->TagResource(
      'ResourceArn' =>
        'arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789012:job-definition/sleep30:1',
      'Tags' => {
        'Stage' => 'Alpha'
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/batch/TagResource>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that tags are added to.
Batch resources that support tags are compute environments, jobs, job
definitions, job queues, and scheduling policies. ARNs for child jobs
of array and multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs aren't supported.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Tags => L<Paws::Batch::TagrisTagsMap>

The tags that you apply to the resource to help you categorize and
organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.
