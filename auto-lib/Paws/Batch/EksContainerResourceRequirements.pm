=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EksContainerResourceRequirements

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EksContainerResourceRequirements object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Limits => $value, ..., Requests => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EksContainerResourceRequirements object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Limits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The type and amount of resources to assign to a container. The
supported resources include C<memory>, C<cpu>, and C<nvidia.com/gpu>.
For more information, see Resource management for pods and containers
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Limits => L<Paws::Batch::EksLimits>

The type and quantity of the resources to reserve for the container.
The values vary based on the C<name> that's specified. Resources can be
requested using either the C<limits> or the C<requests> objects.

=over

=item memory

The memory hard limit (in MiB) for the container, using whole integers,
with a "Mi" suffix. If your container attempts to exceed the memory
specified, the container is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB
of memory for a job. C<memory> can be specified in C<limits>,
C<requests>, or both. If C<memory> is specified in both places, then
the value that's specified in C<limits> must be equal to the value
that's specified in C<requests>.

To maximize your resource utilization, provide your jobs with as much
memory as possible for the specific instance type that you are using.
To learn how, see Memory management
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

=item cpu

The number of CPUs that's reserved for the container. Values must be an
even multiple of C<0.25>. C<cpu> can be specified in C<limits>,
C<requests>, or both. If C<cpu> is specified in both places, then the
value that's specified in C<limits> must be at least as large as the
value that's specified in C<requests>.

=item nvidia.com/gpu

The number of GPUs that's reserved for the container. Values must be a
whole integer. C<memory> can be specified in C<limits>, C<requests>, or
both. If C<memory> is specified in both places, then the value that's
specified in C<limits> must be equal to the value that's specified in
C<requests>.

=back



=head2 Requests => L<Paws::Batch::EksRequests>

The type and quantity of the resources to request for the container.
The values vary based on the C<name> that's specified. Resources can be
requested by using either the C<limits> or the C<requests> objects.

=over

=item memory

The memory hard limit (in MiB) for the container, using whole integers,
with a "Mi" suffix. If your container attempts to exceed the memory
specified, the container is terminated. You must specify at least 4 MiB
of memory for a job. C<memory> can be specified in C<limits>,
C<requests>, or both. If C<memory> is specified in both, then the value
that's specified in C<limits> must be equal to the value that's
specified in C<requests>.

If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing
your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type,
see Memory management
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

=item cpu

The number of CPUs that are reserved for the container. Values must be
an even multiple of C<0.25>. C<cpu> can be specified in C<limits>,
C<requests>, or both. If C<cpu> is specified in both, then the value
that's specified in C<limits> must be at least as large as the value
that's specified in C<requests>.

=item nvidia.com/gpu

The number of GPUs that are reserved for the container. Values must be
a whole integer. C<nvidia.com/gpu> can be specified in C<limits>,
C<requests>, or both. If C<nvidia.com/gpu> is specified in both, then
the value that's specified in C<limits> must be equal to the value
that's specified in C<requests>.
