=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::LinuxParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::LinuxParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Devices => $value, ..., Tmpfs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::LinuxParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Devices

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Linux-specific modifications that are applied to the container, such as
details for device mappings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Devices => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::Device>]

Any of the host devices to expose to the container. This parameter maps
to C<Devices> in the Create a container
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container) section
of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/)
and the C<--device> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't provide it for these jobs.


=head2 InitProcessEnabled => Bool

If true, run an C<init> process inside the container that forwards
signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the C<--init>
option to docker run (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).
This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or
greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API
version on your container instance, log in to your container instance
and run the following command: C<sudo docker version | grep "Server API
version">


=head2 MaxSwap => Int

The total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This
parameter is translated to the C<--memory-swap> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) where the value is the
sum of the container memory plus the C<maxSwap> value. For more
information, see C<--memory-swap> details
(https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#--memory-swap-details)
in the Docker documentation.

If a C<maxSwap> value of C<0> is specified, the container doesn't use
swap. Accepted values are C<0> or any positive integer. If the
C<maxSwap> parameter is omitted, the container doesn't use the swap
configuration for the container instance on which it runs. A C<maxSwap>
value must be set for the C<swappiness> parameter to be used.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't provide it for these jobs.


=head2 SharedMemorySize => Int

The value for the size (in MiB) of the C</dev/shm> volume. This
parameter maps to the C<--shm-size> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't provide it for these jobs.


=head2 Swappiness => Int

You can use this parameter to tune a container's memory swappiness
behavior. A C<swappiness> value of C<0> causes swapping to not occur
unless absolutely necessary. A C<swappiness> value of C<100> causes
pages to be swapped aggressively. Valid values are whole numbers
between C<0> and C<100>. If the C<swappiness> parameter isn't
specified, a default value of C<60> is used. If a value isn't specified
for C<maxSwap>, then this parameter is ignored. If C<maxSwap> is set to
0, the container doesn't use swap. This parameter maps to the
C<--memory-swappiness> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

Consider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.

=over

=item *

Swap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for
the containers to use.

By default, the Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don't have swap enabled. You
must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more
information, see Instance store swap volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-store-swap-volumes.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances> or How do I
allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by
using a swap file?
(http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-memory-swap-file/)

=item *

The swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using
EC2 resources.

=item *

If the C<maxSwap> and C<swappiness> parameters are omitted from a job
definition, each container has a default C<swappiness> value of 60.
Moreover, the total swap usage is limited to two times the memory
reservation of the container.

=back

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't provide it for these jobs.


=head2 Tmpfs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::Tmpfs>]

The container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the C<tmpfs>
mount. This parameter maps to the C<--tmpfs> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't provide this parameter for this resource type.
