=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EksContainerDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EksContainerDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Args => $value, ..., VolumeMounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EksContainerDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Args

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details for container properties that are returned by
C<DescribeJobs> for jobs that use Amazon EKS.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Args => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of arguments to the entrypoint. If this isn't specified, the
C<CMD> of the container image is used. This corresponds to the C<args>
member in the Entrypoint
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#entrypoint)
portion of the Pod
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/)
in Kubernetes. Environment variable references are expanded using the
container's environment.

If the referenced environment variable doesn't exist, the reference in
the command isn't changed. For example, if the reference is to
"C<$(NAME1)>" and the C<NAME1> environment variable doesn't exist, the
command string will remain "C<$(NAME1)>". C<$$> is replaced with C<$>
and the resulting string isn't expanded. For example, C<$$(VAR_NAME)>
is passed as C<$(VAR_NAME)> whether or not the C<VAR_NAME> environment
variable exists. For more information, see Dockerfile reference: CMD
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) and Define a
command and arguments for a pod
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The entrypoint for the container. For more information, see Entrypoint
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#entrypoint)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 Env => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::EksContainerEnvironmentVariable>]

The environment variables to pass to a container.

Environment variables cannot start with "C<AWS_BATCH>". This naming
convention is reserved for variables that Batch sets.


=head2 ExitCode => Int

The exit code returned for the job attempt. A non-zero exit code is
considered failed.


=head2 Image => Str

The Docker image used to start the container.


=head2 ImagePullPolicy => Str

The image pull policy for the container. Supported values are
C<Always>, C<IfNotPresent>, and C<Never>. This parameter defaults to
C<Always> if the C<:latest> tag is specified, C<IfNotPresent>
otherwise. For more information, see Updating images
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#updating-images)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the container. If the name isn't specified, the default
name "C<Default>" is used. Each container in a pod must have a unique
name.


=head2 Reason => Str

A short human-readable string to provide additional details for a
running or stopped container. It can be up to 255 characters long.


=head2 Resources => L<Paws::Batch::EksContainerResourceRequirements>

The type and amount of resources to assign to a container. The
supported resources include C<memory>, C<cpu>, and C<nvidia.com/gpu>.
For more information, see Resource management for pods and containers
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 SecurityContext => L<Paws::Batch::EksContainerSecurityContext>

The security context for a job. For more information, see Configure a
security context for a pod or container
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 VolumeMounts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::EksContainerVolumeMount>]

The volume mounts for the container. Batch supports C<emptyDir>,
C<hostPath>, and C<secret> volume types. For more information about
volumes and volume mounts in Kubernetes, see Volumes
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) in the
I<Kubernetes documentation>.
