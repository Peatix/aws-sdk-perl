=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::ShareAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::ShareAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ShareIdentifier => $value, ..., WeightFactor => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::ShareAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ShareIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the weights for the share identifiers for the fair-share
policy. Share identifiers that aren't included have a default weight of
C<1.0>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ShareIdentifier => Str

A share identifier or share identifier prefix. If the string ends with
an asterisk (*), this entry specifies the weight factor to use for
share identifiers that start with that prefix. The list of share
identifiers in a fair-share policy can't overlap. For example, you
can't have one that specifies a C<shareIdentifier> of C<UserA*> and
another that specifies a C<shareIdentifier> of C<UserA-1>.

There can be no more than 500 share identifiers active in a job queue.

The string is limited to 255 alphanumeric characters, and can be
followed by an asterisk (*).


=head2 WeightFactor => Num

The weight factor for the share identifier. The default value is 1.0. A
lower value has a higher priority for compute resources. For example,
jobs that use a share identifier with a weight factor of 0.125 (1/8)
get 8 times the compute resources of jobs that use a share identifier
with a weight factor of 1.

The smallest supported value is 0.0001, and the largest supported value
is 999.9999.
