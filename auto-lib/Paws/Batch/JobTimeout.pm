=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::JobTimeout

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::JobTimeout object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttemptDurationSeconds => $value, ..., AttemptDurationSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::JobTimeout object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttemptDurationSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents a job timeout configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttemptDurationSeconds => Int

The job timeout time (in seconds) that's measured from the job
attempt's C<startedAt> timestamp. After this time passes, Batch
terminates your jobs if they aren't finished. The minimum value for the
timeout is 60 seconds.

For array jobs, the timeout applies to the child jobs, not to the
parent array job.

For multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs, the timeout applies to the whole
job, not to the individual nodes.
