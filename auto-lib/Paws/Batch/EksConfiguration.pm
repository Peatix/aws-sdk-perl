=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EksConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EksConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EksClusterArn => $value, ..., KubernetesNamespace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EksConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EksClusterArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration for the Amazon EKS cluster that supports the Batch
compute environment. The cluster must exist before the compute
environment can be created.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EksClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EKS cluster. An example is
C<arn:I<aws>:eks:I<us-east-1>:I<123456789012>:cluster/I<ClusterForBatch>
>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KubernetesNamespace => Str

The namespace of the Amazon EKS cluster. Batch manages pods in this
namespace. The value can't left empty or null. It must be fewer than 64
characters long, can't be set to C<default>, can't start with
"C<kube->," and must match this regular expression:
C<^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$>. For more information, see
