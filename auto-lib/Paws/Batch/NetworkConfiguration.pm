=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::NetworkConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::NetworkConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssignPublicIp => $value, ..., AssignPublicIp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::NetworkConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssignPublicIp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Jobs that are running on Amazon EC2 resources must not
specify this parameter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssignPublicIp => Str

Indicates whether the job has a public IP address. For a job that's
running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound
traffic to the internet (for example, to pull container images), the
private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to
the internet. For more information, see Amazon ECS task networking
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>. The default
value is "C<DISABLED>".
