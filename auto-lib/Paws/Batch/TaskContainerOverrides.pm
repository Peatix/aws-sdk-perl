=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::TaskContainerOverrides

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::TaskContainerOverrides object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., ResourceRequirements => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::TaskContainerOverrides object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The overrides that should be sent to a container.

For information about using Batch overrides when you connect event
sources to targets, see BatchContainerOverrides
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/pipes-reference/API_BatchContainerOverrides.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The command to send to the container that overrides the default command
from the Docker image or the job definition.

This parameter can't contain an empty string.


=head2 Environment => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::KeyValuePair>]

The environment variables to send to the container. You can add new
environment variables, which are added to the container at launch, or
you can override the existing environment variables from the Docker
image or the job definition.

Environment variables cannot start with C<AWS_BATCH>. This naming
convention is reserved for variables that Batch sets.


=head2 Name => Str

A pointer to the container that you want to override. The container's
name provides a unique identifier for the container being used.


=head2 ResourceRequirements => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::ResourceRequirement>]

The type and amount of resources to assign to a container. This
overrides the settings in the job definition. The supported resources
include C<GPU>, C<MEMORY>, and C<VCPU>.
