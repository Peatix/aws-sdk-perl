=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::TaskContainerDependency

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::TaskContainerDependency object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Condition => $value, ..., ContainerName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::TaskContainerDependency object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Condition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of containers that this task depends on.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Condition => Str

The dependency condition of the container. The following are the
available conditions and their behavior:

=over

=item *

C<START> - This condition emulates the behavior of links and volumes
today. It validates that a dependent container is started before
permitting other containers to start.

=item *

C<COMPLETE> - This condition validates that a dependent container runs
to completion (exits) before permitting other containers to start. This
can be useful for nonessential containers that run a script and then
exit. This condition can't be set on an essential container.

=item *

C<SUCCESS> - This condition is the same as C<COMPLETE>, but it also
requires that the container exits with a zero status. This condition
can't be set on an essential container.

=back



=head2 ContainerName => Str

A unique identifier for the container.
