=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::ComputeResourceUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::ComputeResourceUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocationStrategy => $value, ..., UpdateToLatestImageVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::ComputeResourceUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the attributes of a compute environment that
can be updated. For more information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocationStrategy => Str

The allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if there's not
enough instances of the best fitting instance type that can be
allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type
in the Region or Amazon EC2 service limits
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html).
For more information, see Allocation strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/allocation-strategies.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

When updating a compute environment, changing the allocation strategy
requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>. C<BEST_FIT> isn't supported when updating a
compute environment.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.

=over

=item BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE

Batch selects additional instance types that are large enough to meet
the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for
instance types with lower cost vCPUs. If additional instances of the
previously selected instance types aren't available, Batch selects new
instance types.

=item SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED

Batch selects one or more instance types that are large enough to meet
the requirements of the jobs in the queue. Its preference is for
instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation
strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

=item SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED

The price and capacity optimized allocation strategy looks at both
price and capacity to select the Spot Instance pools that are the least
likely to be interrupted and have the lowest possible price. This
allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute
resources.

=back

With C<BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE>,C<SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED> and
C<SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED> (recommended) strategies using
On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the C<BEST_FIT> strategy using Spot
Instances, Batch might need to exceed C<maxvCpus> to meet your capacity
requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds C<maxvCpus> by more
than a single instance.


=head2 BidPercentage => Int

The maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared
with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are
launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, the Spot
price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that
Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never
more than your maximum percentage. For most use cases, we recommend
leaving this field empty.

When updating a compute environment, changing the bid percentage
requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 DesiredvCpus => Int

The desired number of vCPUS in the compute environment. Batch modifies
this value between the minimum and maximum values based on job queue
demand.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.

Batch doesn't support changing the desired number of vCPUs of an
existing compute environment. Don't specify this parameter for compute
environments using Amazon EKS clusters.

When you update the C<desiredvCpus> setting, the value must be between
the C<minvCpus> and C<maxvCpus> values.

Additionally, the updated C<desiredvCpus> value must be greater than or
equal to the current C<desiredvCpus> value. For more information, see
Troubleshooting Batch
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#error-desired-vcpus-update)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.


=head2 Ec2Configuration => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::Ec2Configuration>]

Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for
Amazon EC2 instances in the compute environment. If C<Ec2Configuration>
isn't specified, the default is C<ECS_AL2>.

When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>. To remove the Amazon EC2 configuration and
any custom AMI ID specified in C<imageIdOverride>, set this value to an
empty string.

One or two values can be provided.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 Ec2KeyPair => Str

The Amazon EC2 key pair that's used for instances launched in the
compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your
instances with SSH. To remove the Amazon EC2 key pair, set this value
to an empty string.

When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 key pair
requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 ImageId => Str

The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the
compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the
C<imageIdOverride> member of the C<Ec2Configuration> structure. To
remove the custom AMI ID and use the default AMI ID, set this value to
an empty string.

When updating a compute environment, changing the AMI ID requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.

The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the
architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that
compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1
instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support
ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon
ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon
ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 InstanceRole => Str

The Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a
compute environment. Required for Amazon EC2 instances. You can specify
the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance
profile. For example, C< I<ecsInstanceRole> > or
C<arn:aws:iam::I<E<lt>aws_account_idE<gt>>:instance-profile/I<ecsInstanceRole>
>. For more information, see Amazon ECS instance role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/instance_IAM_role.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 InstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance
families to launch any instance type within those families (for
example, C<c5> or C<p3>), or you can specify specific sizes within a
family (such as C<c5.8xlarge>). You can also choose C<optimal> to
select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that
match the demand of your job queues.

When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.

When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you
select for the compute environment must share the same architecture.
For example, you can't mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute
environment.

Currently, C<optimal> uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4
instance families. In Regions that don't have instance types from those
instance families, instance types from the C5, M5, and R5 instance
families are used.


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::Batch::LaunchTemplateSpecification>

The updated launch template to use for your compute resources. You must
specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the
request, but not both. For more information, see Launch template
support
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/launch-templates.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>. To remove the custom launch template and
use the default launch template, set C<launchTemplateId> or
C<launchTemplateName> member of the launch template specification to an
empty string. Removing the launch template from a compute environment
will not remove the AMI specified in the launch template. In order to
update the AMI specified in a launch template, the
C<updateToLatestImageVersion> parameter must be set to C<true>.

When updating a compute environment, changing the launch template
requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 MaxvCpus => Int

The maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment can reach.

With C<BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE>,C<SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED> and
C<SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED> (recommended) strategies using
On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the C<BEST_FIT> strategy using Spot
Instances, Batch might need to exceed C<maxvCpus> to meet your capacity
requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds C<maxvCpus> by more
than a single instance.


=head2 MinvCpus => Int

The minimum number of vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even
if the compute environment is C<DISABLED>).

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 PlacementGroup => Str

The Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute
resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your
compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement
group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your
multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a
single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more
information, see Placement groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.

When updating a compute environment, changing the placement group
requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon EC2 security groups that are associated with instances
launched in the compute environment. This parameter is required for
Fargate compute resources, where it can contain up to 5 security
groups. For Fargate compute resources, providing an empty list is
handled as if this parameter wasn't specified and no change is made.
For Amazon EC2 compute resources, providing an empty list removes the
security groups from the compute resource.

When updating a compute environment, changing the Amazon EC2 security
groups requires an infrastructure update of the compute environment.
For more information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.


=head2 Subnets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. Fargate
compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For Fargate compute
resources, providing an empty list will be handled as if this parameter
wasn't specified and no change is made. For Amazon EC2 compute
resources, providing an empty list removes the VPC subnets from the
compute resource. For more information, see VPCs and subnets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html) in
the I<Amazon VPC User Guide>.

When updating a compute environment, changing the VPC subnets requires
an infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more
information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

Batch on Amazon EC2 and Batch on Amazon EKS support Local Zones. For
more information, see Local Zones
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-local-zones)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>, Amazon EKS and
Amazon Web Services Local Zones
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/local-zones.html) in
the I<Amazon EKS User Guide> and Amazon ECS clusters in Local Zones,
Wavelength Zones, and Amazon Web Services Outposts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-regions-zones.html#clusters-local-zones)
in the I<Amazon ECS Developer Guide>.

Batch on Fargate doesn't currently support Local Zones.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Batch::TagsMap>

Key-value pair tags to be applied to Amazon EC2 resources that are
launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these take the form of
C<"String1": "String2">, where C<String1> is the tag key and C<String2>
is the tag value (for example, C<{ "Name": "Batch Instance -
C4OnDemand" }>). This is helpful for recognizing your Batch instances
in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags aren't seen when using the Batch
C<ListTagsForResource> API operation.

When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Don't specify it.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of compute environment: C<EC2>, C<SPOT>, C<FARGATE>, or
C<FARGATE_SPOT>. For more information, see Compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/compute_environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

If you choose C<SPOT>, you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet
role with the C<spotIamFleetRole> parameter. For more information, see
Amazon EC2 spot fleet role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/spot_fleet_IAM_role.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

When updating a compute environment, changing the type of a compute
environment requires an infrastructure update of the compute
environment. For more information, see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.


=head2 UpdateToLatestImageVersion => Bool

Specifies whether the AMI ID is updated to the latest one that's
supported by Batch when the compute environment has an infrastructure
update. The default value is C<false>.

An AMI ID can either be specified in the C<imageId> or
C<imageIdOverride> parameters or be determined by the launch template
that's specified in the C<launchTemplate> parameter. If an AMI ID is
specified any of these ways, this parameter is ignored. For more
information about to update AMI IDs during an infrastructure update,
see Updating the AMI ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html#updating-compute-environments-ami)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

When updating a compute environment, changing this setting requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
