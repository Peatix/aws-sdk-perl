=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EksPodProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EksPodProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Containers => $value, ..., Volumes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EksPodProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Containers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The properties for the pod.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Containers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::EksContainer>]

The properties of the container that's used on the Amazon EKS pod.

This object is limited to 10 elements.


=head2 DnsPolicy => Str

The DNS policy for the pod. The default value is C<ClusterFirst>. If
the C<hostNetwork> parameter is not specified, the default is
C<ClusterFirstWithHostNet>. C<ClusterFirst> indicates that any DNS
query that does not match the configured cluster domain suffix is
forwarded to the upstream nameserver inherited from the node. For more
information, see Pod's DNS policy
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.

Valid values: C<Default> | C<ClusterFirst> | C<ClusterFirstWithHostNet>


=head2 HostNetwork => Bool

Indicates if the pod uses the hosts' network IP address. The default
value is C<true>. Setting this to C<false> enables the Kubernetes pod
networking model. Most Batch workloads are egress-only and don't
require the overhead of IP allocation for each pod for incoming
connections. For more information, see Host namespaces
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces)
and Pod networking
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-networking) in
the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 ImagePullSecrets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::ImagePullSecret>]

References a Kubernetes secret resource. It holds a list of secrets.
These secrets help to gain access to pull an images from a private
registry.

C<ImagePullSecret$name> is required when this object is used.


=head2 InitContainers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::EksContainer>]

These containers run before application containers, always runs to
completion, and must complete successfully before the next container
starts. These containers are registered with the Amazon EKS Connector
agent and persists the registration information in the Kubernetes
backend data store. For more information, see Init Containers
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.

This object is limited to 10 elements.


=head2 Metadata => L<Paws::Batch::EksMetadata>

Metadata about the Kubernetes pod. For more information, see
Understanding Kubernetes Objects
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 ServiceAccountName => Str

The name of the service account that's used to run the pod. For more
information, see Kubernetes service accounts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service-accounts.html)
and Configure a Kubernetes service account to assume an IAM role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html)
in the I<Amazon EKS User Guide> and Configure service accounts for pods
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.


=head2 ShareProcessNamespace => Bool

Indicates if the processes in a container are shared, or visible, to
other containers in the same pod. For more information, see Share
Process Namespace between Containers in a Pod
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/).


=head2 Volumes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::EksVolume>]

Specifies the volumes for a job definition that uses Amazon EKS
resources.
