=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::LaunchTemplateSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::LaunchTemplateSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LaunchTemplateId => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::LaunchTemplateSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LaunchTemplateId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents a launch template that's associated with a
compute resource. You must specify either the launch template ID or
launch template name in the request, but not both.

If security groups are specified using both the C<securityGroupIds>
parameter of C<CreateComputeEnvironment> and the launch template, the
values in the C<securityGroupIds> parameter of
C<CreateComputeEnvironment> will be used.

This object isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LaunchTemplateId => Str

The ID of the launch template.


=head2 LaunchTemplateName => Str

The name of the launch template.


=head2 Overrides => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::LaunchTemplateSpecificationOverride>]

A launch template to use in place of the default launch template. You
must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in
the request, but not both.

You can specify up to ten (10) launch template overrides that are
associated to unique instance types or families for each compute
environment.

To unset all override templates for a compute environment, you can pass
an empty array to the UpdateComputeEnvironment.overrides
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateComputeEnvironment.html)
parameter, or not include the C<overrides> parameter when submitting
the C<UpdateComputeEnvironment> API operation.


=head2 Version => Str

The version number of the launch template, C<$Default>, or C<$Latest>.

If the value is C<$Default>, the default version of the launch template
is used. If the value is C<$Latest>, the latest version of the launch
template is used.

If the AMI ID that's used in a compute environment is from the launch
template, the AMI isn't changed when the compute environment is
updated. It's only changed if the C<updateToLatestImageVersion>
parameter for the compute environment is set to C<true>. During an
infrastructure update, if either C<$Default> or C<$Latest> is
specified, Batch re-evaluates the launch template version, and it might
use a different version of the launch template. This is the case even
if the launch template isn't specified in the update. When updating a
compute environment, changing the launch template requires an
infrastructure update of the compute environment. For more information,
see Updating compute environments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/updating-compute-environments.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

Default: C<$Default>

Latest: C<$Latest>
