=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EvaluateOnExit

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EvaluateOnExit object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., OnStatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EvaluateOnExit object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies an array of up to 5 conditions to be met, and an action to
take (C<RETRY> or C<EXIT>) if all conditions are met. If none of the
C<EvaluateOnExit> conditions in a C<RetryStrategy> match, then the job
is retried.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => Str

Specifies the action to take if all of the specified conditions
(C<onStatusReason>, C<onReason>, and C<onExitCode>) are met. The values
aren't case sensitive.


=head2 OnExitCode => Str

Contains a glob pattern to match against the decimal representation of
the C<ExitCode> returned for a job. The pattern can be up to 512
characters long. It can contain only numbers, and can end with an
asterisk (*) so that only the start of the string needs to be an exact
match.

The string can contain up to 512 characters.


=head2 OnReason => Str

Contains a glob pattern to match against the C<Reason> returned for a
job. The pattern can contain up to 512 characters. It can contain
letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white space (including
spaces and tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that
only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.


=head2 OnStatusReason => Str

Contains a glob pattern to match against the C<StatusReason> returned
for a job. The pattern can contain up to 512 characters. It can contain
letters, numbers, periods (.), colons (:), and white spaces (including
spaces or tabs). It can optionally end with an asterisk (*) so that
only the start of the string needs to be an exact match.
