=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EksMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EksMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Annotations => $value, ..., Namespace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EksMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Annotations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes and uniquely identifies Kubernetes resources. For example,
the compute environment that a pod runs in or the C<jobID> for a job
running in the pod. For more information, see Understanding Kubernetes
Objects
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Annotations => L<Paws::Batch::EksAnnotationsMap>

Key-value pairs used to attach arbitrary, non-identifying metadata to
Kubernetes objects. Valid annotation keys have two segments: an
optional prefix and a name, separated by a slash (/).

=over

=item *

The prefix is optional and must be 253 characters or less. If
specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomainE<minus> a series of DNS
labels separated by dots (.), and it must end with a slash (/).

=item *

The name segment is required and must be 63 characters or less. It can
include alphanumeric characters ([a-z0-9A-Z]), dashes (-), underscores
(_), and dots (.), but must begin and end with an alphanumeric
character.

=back

Annotation values must be 255 characters or less.

Annotations can be added or modified at any time. Each resource can
have multiple annotations.


=head2 Labels => L<Paws::Batch::EksLabelsMap>

Key-value pairs used to identify, sort, and organize cube resources.
Can contain up to 63 uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,
hyphens (-), and underscores (_). Labels can be added or modified at
any time. Each resource can have multiple labels, but each key must be
unique for a given object.


=head2 Namespace => Str

The namespace of the Amazon EKS cluster. In Kubernetes, namespaces
provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single
cluster. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but
not across namespaces. Batch places Batch Job pods in this namespace.
If this field is provided, the value can't be empty or null. It must
meet the following requirements:

=over

=item *

1-63 characters long

=item *

Can't be set to default

=item *

Can't start with C<kube>

=item *

Must match the following regular expression:
C<^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$>

=back

For more information, see Namespaces
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
in the I<Kubernetes documentation>. This namespace can be different
from the C<kubernetesNamespace> set in the compute environment's
C<EksConfiguration>, but must have identical role-based access control
(RBAC) roles as the compute environment's C<kubernetesNamespace>. For
multi-node parallel jobs, the same value must be provided across all
the node ranges.
