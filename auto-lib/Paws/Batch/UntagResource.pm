=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::UntagResource - Arguments for method UntagResource on L<Paws::Batch>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UntagResource on the
L<AWS Batch|Paws::Batch> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UntagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UntagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $batch = Paws->service('Batch');
    # UntagResource Example
    # This demonstrates calling the UntagResource action.
    my $UntagResourceResponse = $batch->UntagResource(
      'ResourceArn' =>
        'arn:aws:batch:us-east-1:123456789012:job-definition/sleep30:1',
      'TagKeys' => ['Stage']
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/batch/UntagResource>
