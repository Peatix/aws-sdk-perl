=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::ContainerOverrides

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::ContainerOverrides object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., Vcpus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::ContainerOverrides object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The overrides that should be sent to a container.

For information about using Batch overrides when you connect event
sources to targets, see BatchContainerOverrides
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/pipes-reference/API_BatchContainerOverrides.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The command to send to the container that overrides the default command
from the Docker image or the job definition.

This parameter can't contain an empty string.


=head2 Environment => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::KeyValuePair>]

The environment variables to send to the container. You can add new
environment variables, which are added to the container at launch, or
you can override the existing environment variables from the Docker
image or the job definition.

Environment variables cannot start with "C<AWS_BATCH>". This naming
convention is reserved for variables that Batch sets.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The instance type to use for a multi-node parallel job.

This parameter isn't applicable to single-node container jobs or jobs
that run on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be provided.


=head2 Memory => Int

This parameter is deprecated, use C<resourceRequirements> to override
the memory requirements specified in the job definition. It's not
supported for jobs running on Fargate resources. For jobs that run on
Amazon EC2 resources, it overrides the C<memory> parameter set in the
job definition, but doesn't override any memory requirement that's
specified in the C<resourceRequirements> structure in the job
definition. To override memory requirements that are specified in the
C<resourceRequirements> structure in the job definition,
C<resourceRequirements> must be specified in the C<SubmitJob> request,
with C<type> set to C<MEMORY> and C<value> set to the new value. For
more information, see Can't override job definition resource
requirements
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#override-resource-requirements)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.


=head2 ResourceRequirements => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::ResourceRequirement>]

The type and amount of resources to assign to a container. This
overrides the settings in the job definition. The supported resources
include C<GPU>, C<MEMORY>, and C<VCPU>.


=head2 Vcpus => Int

This parameter is deprecated, use C<resourceRequirements> to override
the C<vcpus> parameter that's set in the job definition. It's not
supported for jobs running on Fargate resources. For jobs that run on
Amazon EC2 resources, it overrides the C<vcpus> parameter set in the
job definition, but doesn't override any vCPU requirement specified in
the C<resourceRequirements> structure in the job definition. To
override vCPU requirements that are specified in the
C<resourceRequirements> structure in the job definition,
C<resourceRequirements> must be specified in the C<SubmitJob> request,
with C<type> set to C<VCPU> and C<value> set to the new value. For more
information, see Can't override job definition resource requirements
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/troubleshooting.html#override-resource-requirements)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.
