=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EphemeralStorage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EphemeralStorage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SizeInGiB => $value, ..., SizeInGiB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EphemeralStorage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SizeInGiB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The amount of ephemeral storage to allocate for the task. This
parameter is used to expand the total amount of ephemeral storage
available, beyond the default amount, for tasks hosted on Fargate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SizeInGiB => Int
