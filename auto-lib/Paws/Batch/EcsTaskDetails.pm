=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::EcsTaskDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::EcsTaskDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerInstanceArn => $value, ..., Volumes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::EcsTaskDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerInstanceArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of a task definition that describes the container and
volume definitions of an Amazon ECS task.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerInstanceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container instance that hosts the
task.


=head2 Containers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::TaskContainerDetails>]

A list of containers that are included in the C<taskProperties> list.


=head2 EnableExecuteCommand => Bool

Determines whether execute command functionality is turned on for this
task. If C<true>, execute command functionality is turned on all the
containers in the task.


=head2 EphemeralStorage => L<Paws::Batch::EphemeralStorage>

The amount of ephemeral storage allocated for the task.


=head2 ExecutionRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution role that Batch can
assume. For more information, see Batch execution IAM role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/execution-IAM-role.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.


=head2 IpcMode => Str

The IPC resource namespace to use for the containers in the task.


=head2 NetworkConfiguration => L<Paws::Batch::NetworkConfiguration>

The network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate
resources. Jobs that are running on Amazon EC2 resources must not
specify this parameter.


=head2 PidMode => Str

The process namespace to use for the containers in the task.


=head2 PlatformVersion => Str

The Fargate platform version where the jobs are running.


=head2 RuntimePlatform => L<Paws::Batch::RuntimePlatform>

An object that represents the compute environment architecture for
Batch jobs on Fargate.


=head2 TaskArn => Str

The ARN of the Amazon ECS task.


=head2 TaskRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the container can
assume for Amazon Web Services permissions. For more information, see
IAM roles for tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

This is object is comparable to ContainerProperties:jobRoleArn
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerProperties.html).


=head2 Volumes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Batch::Volume>]

A list of data volumes used in a job.
