=head1 NAME

Paws::Batch::Ec2Configuration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Batch::Ec2Configuration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImageIdOverride => $value, ..., ImageType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Batch::Ec2Configuration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImageIdOverride

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for
instances in the compute environment. If C<Ec2Configuration> isn't
specified, the default is C<ECS_AL2> (Amazon Linux 2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#al2ami)).

This object isn't applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate
resources.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ImageIdOverride => Str

The AMI ID used for instances launched in the compute environment that
match the image type. This setting overrides the C<imageId> set in the
C<computeResource> object.

The AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the
architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that
compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1
instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support
ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon
ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon
ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux-variants.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 ImageKubernetesVersion => Str

The Kubernetes version for the compute environment. If you don't
specify a value, the latest version that Batch supports is used.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImageType => Str

The image type to match with the instance type to select an AMI. The
supported values are different for C<ECS> and C<EKS> resources.

=over

=item ECS

If the C<imageIdOverride> parameter isn't specified, then a recent
Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#al2ami)
(C<ECS_AL2>) is used. If a new image type is specified in an update,
but neither an C<imageId> nor a C<imageIdOverride> parameter is
specified, then the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI for that image type
that's supported by Batch is used.

=over

=item ECS_AL2

Amazon Linux 2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#al2ami):
Default for all non-GPU instance families.

=item ECS_AL2_NVIDIA

Amazon Linux 2 (GPU)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#gpuami):
Default for all GPU instance families (for example C<P4> and C<G4>) and
can be used for all non Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance
types.

=item ECS_AL2023

Amazon Linux 2023
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html):
Batch supports Amazon Linux 2023.

Amazon Linux 2023 does not support C<A1> instances.

=item ECS_AL1

Amazon Linux
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#alami).
Amazon Linux has reached the end-of-life of standard support. For more
information, see Amazon Linux AMI
(http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/).

=item EKS

If the C<imageIdOverride> parameter isn't specified, then a recent
Amazon EKS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html)
(C<EKS_AL2>) is used. If a new image type is specified in an update,
but neither an C<imageId> nor a C<imageIdOverride> parameter is
specified, then the latest Amazon EKS optimized AMI for that image type
that Batch supports is used.

=over

=item EKS_AL2

Amazon Linux 2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html):
Default for all non-GPU instance families.

=item EKS_AL2_NVIDIA

Amazon Linux 2 (accelerated)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html):
Default for all GPU instance families (for example, C<P4> and C<G4>)
and can be used for all non Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance
types.
