=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::ReplicaDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::ReplicaDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GlobalSecondaryIndexes => $value, ..., WarmThroughput => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::ReplicaDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GlobalSecondaryIndexes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details of the replica.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GlobalSecondaryIndexes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DynamoDB::ReplicaGlobalSecondaryIndexDescription>]

Replica-specific global secondary index settings.


=head2 KMSMasterKeyId => Str

The KMS key of the replica that will be used for KMS encryption.


=head2 OnDemandThroughputOverride => L<Paws::DynamoDB::OnDemandThroughputOverride>

Overrides the maximum on-demand throughput settings for the specified
replica table.


=head2 ProvisionedThroughputOverride => L<Paws::DynamoDB::ProvisionedThroughputOverride>

Replica-specific provisioned throughput. If not described, uses the
source table's provisioned throughput settings.


=head2 RegionName => Str

The name of the Region.


=head2 ReplicaInaccessibleDateTime => Str

The time at which the replica was first detected as inaccessible. To
determine cause of inaccessibility check the C<ReplicaStatus> property.


=head2 ReplicaStatus => Str

The current state of the replica:

=over

=item *

C<CREATING> - The replica is being created.

=item *

C<UPDATING> - The replica is being updated.

=item *

C<DELETING> - The replica is being deleted.

=item *

C<ACTIVE> - The replica is ready for use.

=item *

C<REGION_DISABLED> - The replica is inaccessible because the Amazon Web
Services Region has been disabled.

If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible for more than 20
hours, DynamoDB will remove this replica from the replication group.
The replica will not be deleted and replication will stop from and to
this region.

=item *

C<INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS > - The KMS key used to encrypt
the table is inaccessible.

If the KMS key remains inaccessible for more than 20 hours, DynamoDB
will remove this replica from the replication group. The replica will
not be deleted and replication will stop from and to this region.

=back



=head2 ReplicaStatusDescription => Str

Detailed information about the replica status.


=head2 ReplicaStatusPercentProgress => Str

Specifies the progress of a Create, Update, or Delete action on the
replica as a percentage.


=head2 ReplicaTableClassSummary => L<Paws::DynamoDB::TableClassSummary>




=head2 WarmThroughput => L<Paws::DynamoDB::TableWarmThroughputDescription>

Represents the warm throughput value for this replica.
