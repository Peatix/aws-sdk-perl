=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::GlobalSecondaryIndexWarmThroughputDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::GlobalSecondaryIndexWarmThroughputDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReadUnitsPerSecond => $value, ..., WriteUnitsPerSecond => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::GlobalSecondaryIndexWarmThroughputDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReadUnitsPerSecond

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The description of the warm throughput value on a global secondary
index.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReadUnitsPerSecond => Int

Represents warm throughput read units per second value for a global
secondary index.

Represents the warm throughput status being created or updated on a
global secondary index. The status can only be C<UPDATING> or
C<ACTIVE>.


=head2 WriteUnitsPerSecond => Int

Represents warm throughput write units per second value for a global
secondary index.
