=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::ParameterizedStatement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::ParameterizedStatement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Parameters => $value, ..., Statement => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::ParameterizedStatement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Parameters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a PartiQL statement that uses parameters.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Parameters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DynamoDB::AttributeValue>]

The parameter values.


=head2 ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure => Str

An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for a PartiQL
C<ParameterizedStatement> operation that failed a condition check.

There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value
aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a
larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Statement => Str

A PartiQL statement that uses parameters.
