=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::WarmThroughput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::WarmThroughput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReadUnitsPerSecond => $value, ..., WriteUnitsPerSecond => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::WarmThroughput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReadUnitsPerSecond

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides visibility into the number of read and write operations your
table or secondary index can instantaneously support. The settings can
be modified using the C<UpdateTable> operation to meet the throughput
requirements of an upcoming peak event.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReadUnitsPerSecond => Int

Represents the number of read operations your base table can
instantaneously support.


=head2 WriteUnitsPerSecond => Int

Represents the number of write operations your base table can
instantaneously support.
