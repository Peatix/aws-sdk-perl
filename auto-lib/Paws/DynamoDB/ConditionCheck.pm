=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::ConditionCheck

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::ConditionCheck object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConditionExpression => $value, ..., TableName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::ConditionCheck object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConditionExpression

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a request to perform a check that an item exists or to check
the condition of specific attributes of the item.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionExpression => Str

A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update to
succeed. For more information, see Condition expressions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html)
in the I<Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>.


=head2 ExpressionAttributeNames => L<Paws::DynamoDB::ExpressionAttributeNameMap>

One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression.
For more information, see Expression attribute names
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ExpressionAttributeNames.html)
in the I<Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>.


=head2 ExpressionAttributeValues => L<Paws::DynamoDB::ExpressionAttributeValueMap>

One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. For more
information, see Condition expressions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ConditionExpressions.html)
in the I<Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => L<Paws::DynamoDB::Key>

The primary key of the item to be checked. Each element consists of an
attribute name and a value for that attribute.


=head2 ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure => Str

Use C<ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure> to get the item attributes
if the C<ConditionCheck> condition fails. For
C<ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure>, the valid values are: NONE and
ALL_OLD.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TableName => Str

Name of the table for the check item request. You can also provide the
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.
