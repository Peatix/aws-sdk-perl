=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::IncrementalExportSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::IncrementalExportSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExportFromTime => $value, ..., ExportViewType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::IncrementalExportSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExportFromTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Optional object containing the parameters specific to an incremental
export.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExportFromTime => Str

Time in the past which provides the inclusive start range for the
export table's data, counted in seconds from the start of the Unix
epoch. The incremental export will reflect the table's state including
and after this point in time.


=head2 ExportToTime => Str

Time in the past which provides the exclusive end range for the export
table's data, counted in seconds from the start of the Unix epoch. The
incremental export will reflect the table's state just prior to this
point in time. If this is not provided, the latest time with data
available will be used.


=head2 ExportViewType => Str

The view type that was chosen for the export. Valid values are
C<NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES> and C<NEW_IMAGES>. The default value is
C<NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES>.
