=head1 NAME

Paws::DynamoDB::OnDemandThroughput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DynamoDB::OnDemandThroughput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxReadRequestUnits => $value, ..., MaxWriteRequestUnits => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DynamoDB::OnDemandThroughput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxReadRequestUnits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sets the maximum number of read and write units for the specified
on-demand table. If you use this parameter, you must specify
C<MaxReadRequestUnits>, C<MaxWriteRequestUnits>, or both.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxReadRequestUnits => Int

Maximum number of read request units for the specified table.

To specify a maximum C<OnDemandThroughput> on your table, set the value
of C<MaxReadRequestUnits> as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the
maximum C<OnDemandThroughput> that is currently set on your table, set
the value of C<MaxReadRequestUnits> to -1.


=head2 MaxWriteRequestUnits => Int

Maximum number of write request units for the specified table.

To specify a maximum C<OnDemandThroughput> on your table, set the value
of C<MaxWriteRequestUnits> as greater than or equal to 1. To remove the
maximum C<OnDemandThroughput> that is currently set on your table, set
the value of C<MaxWriteRequestUnits> to -1.
