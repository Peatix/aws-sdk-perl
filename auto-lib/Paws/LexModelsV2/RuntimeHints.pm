=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can provide Amazon Lex with hints to the phrases that a customer is
likely to use for a slot. When a slot with hints is resolved, the
phrases in the runtime hints are preferred in the resolution. You can
provide hints for a maximum of 100 intents. You can provide a maximum
of 100 slots.

Before you can use runtime hints with an existing bot, you must first
rebuild the bot.

For more information, see Using runtime hints to improve recognition of
slot values
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/using-hints.html).
