=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsSessionResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsSessionResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BinKeys => $value, ..., MetricsResults => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsSessionResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BinKeys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object containing the results for the session metrics you requested
and the bin and/or group(s) they refer to, if applicable.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BinKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsBinKey>]

A list of objects containing the criteria you requested for binning
results and the values of the bins.


=head2 GroupByKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsSessionGroupByKey>]

A list of objects containing the criteria you requested for grouping
results and the values of the bins.


=head2 MetricsResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::AnalyticsSessionMetricResult>]

A list of objects, each of which contains a metric you want to list,
the statistic for the metric you want to return, and the method by
which to organize the results.
