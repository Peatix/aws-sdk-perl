=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentStartResponseSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentStartResponseSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowInterrupt => $value, ..., MessageGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentStartResponseSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowInterrupt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides settings for a message that is sent to the user when a
fulfillment Lambda function starts running.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowInterrupt => Bool

Determines whether the user can interrupt the start message while it is
playing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DelayInSeconds => Int

The delay between when the Lambda fulfillment function starts running
and the start message is played. If the Lambda function returns before
the delay is over, the start message isn't played.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MessageGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::MessageGroup>]

1 - 5 message groups that contain start messages. Amazon Lex chooses
one of the messages to play to the user.
