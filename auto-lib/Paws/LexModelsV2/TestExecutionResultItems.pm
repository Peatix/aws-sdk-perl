=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::TestExecutionResultItems

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::TestExecutionResultItems object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConversationLevelTestResults => $value, ..., UtteranceLevelTestResults => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::TestExecutionResultItems object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConversationLevelTestResults

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the results of the test execution, grouped by type of results.
See Test result details"E<gt>Test results details
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/test-results-details-test-set.html)
for details about different types of results.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConversationLevelTestResults => L<Paws::LexModelsV2::ConversationLevelTestResults>

Results related to conversations in the test set, including metrics
about success and failure of conversations and intent and slot
failures.


=head2 IntentClassificationTestResults => L<Paws::LexModelsV2::IntentClassificationTestResults>

Intent recognition results aggregated by intent name. The aggregated
