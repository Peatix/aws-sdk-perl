=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentUpdateResponseSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentUpdateResponseSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowInterrupt => $value, ..., MessageGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::FulfillmentUpdateResponseSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowInterrupt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides settings for a message that is sent periodically to the user
while a fulfillment Lambda function is running.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowInterrupt => Bool

Determines whether the user can interrupt an update message while it is
playing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FrequencyInSeconds => Int

The frequency that a message is sent to the user. When the period ends,
Amazon Lex chooses a message from the message groups and plays it to
the user. If the fulfillment Lambda returns before the first period
ends, an update message is not played to the user.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MessageGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::MessageGroup>]

1 - 5 message groups that contain update messages. Amazon Lex chooses
one of the messages to play to the user.
