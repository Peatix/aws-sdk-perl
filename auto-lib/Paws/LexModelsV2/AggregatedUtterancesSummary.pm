=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::AggregatedUtterancesSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::AggregatedUtterancesSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainsDataFromDeletedResources => $value, ..., UtteranceLastRecordedInAggregationDuration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::AggregatedUtterancesSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainsDataFromDeletedResources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides summary information for aggregated utterances. The
C<ListAggregatedUtterances> operations combines all instances of the
same utterance into a single aggregated summary.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainsDataFromDeletedResources => Bool

Aggregated utterance data may contain utterances from versions of your
bot that have since been deleted. When the aggregated contains this
kind of data, this field is set to true.


=head2 HitCount => Int

The number of times that the utterance was detected by Amazon Lex
during the time period. When an utterance is detected, it activates an
intent or a slot.


=head2 MissedCount => Int

The number of times that the utterance was missed by Amazon Lex An
utterance is missed when it doesn't activate an intent or slot.


=head2 Utterance => Str

The text of the utterance. If the utterance was used with the
C<RecognizeUtterance> operation, the text is the transcription of the
audio utterance.


=head2 UtteranceFirstRecordedInAggregationDuration => Str

The date and time that the utterance was first recorded in the time
window for aggregation. An utterance may have been sent to Amazon Lex
before that time, but only utterances within the time window are
counted.


=head2 UtteranceLastRecordedInAggregationDuration => Str

The last date and time that an utterance was recorded in the time
window for aggregation. An utterance may be sent to Amazon Lex after
that time, but only utterances within the time window are counted.
