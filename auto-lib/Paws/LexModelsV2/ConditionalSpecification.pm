=head1 NAME

Paws::LexModelsV2::ConditionalSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LexModelsV2::ConditionalSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Active => $value, ..., DefaultBranch => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::ConditionalSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Active

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a list of conditional branches. Branches are evaluated in the
order that they are entered in the list. The first branch with a
condition that evaluates to true is executed. The last branch in the
list is the default branch. The default branch should not have any
condition expression. The default branch is executed if no other branch
has a matching condition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Active => Bool

Determines whether a conditional branch is active. When C<active> is
false, the conditions are not evaluated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionalBranches => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LexModelsV2::ConditionalBranch>]

A list of conditional branches. A conditional branch is made up of a
condition, a response and a next step. The response and next step are
executed when the condition is true.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultBranch => L<Paws::LexModelsV2::DefaultConditionalBranch>

The conditional branch that should be followed when the conditions for
other branches are not satisfied. A conditional branch is made up of a
condition, a response and a next step.
