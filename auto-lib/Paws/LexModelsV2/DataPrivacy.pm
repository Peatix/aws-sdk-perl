  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChildDirected => $value, ..., ChildDirected => $value  });

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LexModelsV2::DataPrivacy object:

By default, data stored by Amazon Lex is encrypted. The C<DataPrivacy>
structure provides settings that determine how Amazon Lex handles
special cases of securing the data for your bot.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ChildDirected => Bool

For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building
Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to
a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted,
in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specifying C<true>
or C<false> in the C<childDirected> field. By specifying C<true> in the
C<childDirected> field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex B<is>
related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or
targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to
COPPA. By specifying C<false> in the C<childDirected> field, you
confirm that your use of Amazon Lex B<is not> related to a website,
program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or
in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not
specify a default value for the C<childDirected> field that does not
accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a
website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in
whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If
your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other
application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age
13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under
COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex in connection
with websites, programs, or other applications that are directed or
targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon
Lex FAQ (http://aws.amazon.com/lex/faqs#data-security).
