=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::WebCrawlerConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::WebCrawlerConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthenticationConfiguration => $value, ..., Urls => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::WebCrawlerConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthenticationConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information required for Amazon Kendra Web
Crawler.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthenticationConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::AuthenticationConfiguration>

Configuration information required to connect to websites using
authentication.

You can connect to websites using basic authentication of user name and
password. You use a secret in Secrets Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html)
to store your authentication credentials.

You must provide the website host name and port number. For example,
the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is "a.example.com"
and the port is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.


=head2 CrawlDepth => Int

The 'depth' or number of levels from the seed level to crawl. For
example, the seed URL page is depth 1 and any hyperlinks on this page
that are also crawled are depth 2.


=head2 MaxContentSizePerPageInMegaBytes => Num

The maximum size (in MB) of a web page or attachment to crawl.

Files larger than this size (in MB) are skipped/not crawled.

The default maximum size of a web page or attachment is set to 50 MB.


=head2 MaxLinksPerPage => Int

The maximum number of URLs on a web page to include when crawling a
website. This number is per web page.

As a websiteE<rsquo>s web pages are crawled, any URLs the web pages
link to are also crawled. URLs on a web page are crawled in order of
appearance.

The default maximum links per page is 100.


=head2 MaxUrlsPerMinuteCrawlRate => Int

The maximum number of URLs crawled per website host per minute.

A minimum of one URL is required.

The default maximum number of URLs crawled per website host per minute
is 300.


=head2 ProxyConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::ProxyConfiguration>

Configuration information required to connect to your internal websites
via a web proxy.

You must provide the website host name and port number. For example,
the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is "a.example.com"
and the port is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.

Web proxy credentials are optional and you can use them to connect to a
web proxy server that requires basic authentication. To store web proxy
credentials, you use a secret in Secrets Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/intro.html).


=head2 UrlExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain URLs to crawl.
URLs that match the patterns are excluded from the index. URLs that
don't match the patterns are included in the index. If a URL matches
both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the URL file isn't included in the index.


=head2 UrlInclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain URLs to crawl.
URLs that match the patterns are included in the index. URLs that don't
match the patterns are excluded from the index. If a URL matches both
an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the URL file isn't included in the index.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Urls => L<Paws::Kendra::Urls>

Specifies the seed or starting point URLs of the websites or the
sitemap URLs of the websites you want to crawl.

You can include website subdomains. You can list up to 100 seed URLs
and up to three sitemap URLs.

You can only crawl websites that use the secure communication protocol,
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). If you receive an error
when crawling a website, it could be that the website is blocked from
crawling.

I<When selecting websites to index, you must adhere to the Amazon
Acceptable Use Policy (https://aws.amazon.com/aup/) and all other
Amazon terms. Remember that you must only use Amazon Kendra Web Crawler
to index your own web pages, or web pages that you have authorization
to index.>
