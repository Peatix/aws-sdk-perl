=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowKnowledgeArticleConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowKnowledgeArticleConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlAttachments => $value, ..., IncludeAttachmentFilePatterns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowKnowledgeArticleConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlAttachments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information for crawling knowledge articles
in the ServiceNow site.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlAttachments => Bool

C<TRUE> to index attachments to knowledge articles.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DocumentDataFieldName => Str

The name of the ServiceNow field that is mapped to the index document
contents field in the Amazon Kendra index.


=head2 DocumentTitleFieldName => Str

The name of the ServiceNow field that is mapped to the index document
title field.


=head2 ExcludeAttachmentFilePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns applied to exclude certain
knowledge article attachments. Attachments that match the patterns are
excluded from the index. Items that don't match the patterns are
included in the index. If an item matches both an inclusion and
exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the item
isn't included in the index.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

Maps attributes or field names of knoweldge articles to Amazon Kendra
index field names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API
before you map to ServiceNow fields. For more information, see Mapping
data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
ServiceNow data source field names must exist in your ServiceNow custom
metadata.


=head2 FilterQuery => Str

A query that selects the knowledge articles to index. The query can
return articles from multiple knowledge bases, and the knowledge bases
can be public or private.

The query string must be one generated by the ServiceNow console. For
more information, see Specifying documents to index with a query
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/servicenow-query.html).


=head2 IncludeAttachmentFilePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns applied to include knowledge
article attachments. Attachments that match the patterns are included
in the index. Items that don't match the patterns are excluded from the
index. If an item matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the
exclusion pattern takes precedence and the item isn't included in the
index.
