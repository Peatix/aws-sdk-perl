=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::AlfrescoConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::AlfrescoConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BlogFieldMappings => $value, ..., WikiFieldMappings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::AlfrescoConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BlogFieldMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Alfresco as your
data source.

Support for C<AlfrescoConfiguration> ended May 2023. We recommend
migrating to or using the Alfresco data source template schema /
TemplateConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_TemplateConfiguration.html)
API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BlogFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Alfresco blogs to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to
Alfresco fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Alfresco data source field names must exist in your Alfresco custom
metadata.


=head2 CrawlComments => Bool

C<TRUE> to index comments of blogs and other content.


=head2 CrawlSystemFolders => Bool

C<TRUE> to index shared files.


=head2 DocumentLibraryFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Alfresco document libraries to Amazon Kendra index
field names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before
you map to Alfresco fields. For more information, see Mapping data
source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Alfresco data source field names must exist in your Alfresco custom
metadata.


=head2 EntityFilter => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify whether to index document libraries, wikis, or blogs. You can
specify one or more of these options.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain files in your
Alfresco data source. Files that match the patterns are excluded from
the index. Files that don't match the patterns are included in the
index. If a file matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion
pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't
included in the index.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain files in your
Alfresco data source. Files that match the patterns are included in the
index. Files that don't match the patterns are excluded from the index.
If a file matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern,
the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included in
the index.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Manager secret that
contains the key-value pairs required to connect to your Alfresco data
source. The secret must contain a JSON structure with the following
keys:

=over

=item *

usernameE<mdash>The user name of the Alfresco account.

=item *

passwordE<mdash>The password of the Alfresco account.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SiteId => Str

The identifier of the Alfresco site. For example, I<my-site>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SiteUrl => Str

The URL of the Alfresco site. For example, I<https://hostname:8080>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SslCertificateS3Path => L<Paws::Kendra::S3Path>

The path to the SSL certificate stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. You use
this to connect to Alfresco if you require a secure SSL connection.

You can simply generate a self-signed X509 certificate on any computer
using OpenSSL. For an example of using OpenSSL to create an X509
certificate, see Create and sign an X509 certificate
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-ssl.html).


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>

Configuration information for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to
connect to your Alfresco. For more information, see Configuring a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/vpc-configuration.html).


=head2 WikiFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Alfresco wikis to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to
Alfresco fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Alfresco data source field names must exist in your Alfresco custom
metadata.
