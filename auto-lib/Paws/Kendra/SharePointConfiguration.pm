=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthenticationType => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::SharePointConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthenticationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Microsoft
SharePoint as your data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthenticationType => Str

Whether you want to connect to SharePoint Online using basic
authentication of user name and password, or OAuth authentication of
user name, password, client ID, and client secret, or AD App-only
authentication of client secret.


=head2 CrawlAttachments => Bool

C<TRUE> to index document attachments.


=head2 DisableLocalGroups => Bool

C<TRUE> to disable local groups information.


=head2 DocumentTitleFieldName => Str

The Microsoft SharePoint attribute field that contains the title of the
document.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain documents in
your SharePoint. Documents that match the patterns are excluded from
the index. Documents that don't match the patterns are included in the
index. If a document matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern,
the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the document isn't included
in the index.

The regex applies to the display URL of the SharePoint document.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map SharePoint
data source attributes or field names to Amazon Kendra index field
names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you
map to SharePoint fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
SharePoint data source field names must exist in your SharePoint custom
metadata.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain documents in
your SharePoint. Documents that match the patterns are included in the
index. Documents that don't match the patterns are excluded from the
index. If a document matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern,
the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the document isn't included
in the index.

The regex applies to the display URL of the SharePoint document.


=head2 ProxyConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::ProxyConfiguration>

Configuration information to connect to your Microsoft SharePoint site
URLs via instance via a web proxy. You can use this option for
SharePoint Server.

You must provide the website host name and port number. For example,
the host name of I<https://a.example.com/page1.html> is "a.example.com"
and the port is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.

Web proxy credentials are optional and you can use them to connect to a
web proxy server that requires basic authentication of user name and
password. To store web proxy credentials, you use a secret in Secrets
Manager.

It is recommended that you follow best security practices when
configuring your web proxy. This includes setting up throttling,
setting up logging and monitoring, and applying security patches on a
regular basis. If you use your web proxy with multiple data sources,
sync jobs that occur at the same time could strain the load on your
proxy. It is recommended you prepare your proxy beforehand for any
security and load requirements.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Manager secret that
contains the user name and password required to connect to the
SharePoint instance. For more information, see Microsoft SharePoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-sharepoint.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SharePointVersion => Str

The version of Microsoft SharePoint that you use.


=head2 SslCertificateS3Path => L<Paws::Kendra::S3Path>

The path to the SSL certificate stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. You use
this to connect to SharePoint Server if you require a secure SSL
connection.

You can generate a self-signed X509 certificate on any computer using
OpenSSL. For an example of using OpenSSL to create an X509 certificate,
see Create and sign an X509 certificate
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https-ssl.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Urls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Microsoft SharePoint site URLs for the documents you want to index.


=head2 UseChangeLog => Bool

C<TRUE> to use the SharePoint change log to determine which documents
require updating in the index. Depending on the change log's size, it
may take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log than to scan
all of your documents in SharePoint.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>

Configuration information for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to
connect to your Microsoft SharePoint. For more information, see
Configuring a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/vpc-configuration.html).
