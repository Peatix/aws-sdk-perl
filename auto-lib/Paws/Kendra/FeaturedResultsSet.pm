=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::FeaturedResultsSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::FeaturedResultsSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTimestamp => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::FeaturedResultsSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of featured results that are displayed at the top of your search
results. Featured results are placed above all other results for
certain queries. If there's an exact match of a query, then one or more
specific documents are featured in the search results.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTimestamp => Int

The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description for the set of featured results.


=head2 FeaturedDocuments => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::FeaturedDocument>]

The list of document IDs for the documents you want to feature at the
top of the search results page. You can use the Query
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_Query.html) API to
search for specific documents with their document IDs included in the
result items, or you can use the console.

You can add up to four featured documents. You can request to increase
this limit by contacting Support (http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

Specific queries are mapped to specific documents for featuring in the
results. If a query contains an exact match, then one or more specific
documents are featured in the results. The exact match applies to the
full query. For example, if you only specify 'Kendra', queries such as
'How does kendra semantically rank results?' will not render the
featured results. Featured results are designed for specific queries,
rather than queries that are too broad in scope.


=head2 FeaturedResultsSetId => Str

The identifier of the set of featured results.


=head2 FeaturedResultsSetName => Str

The name for the set of featured results.


=head2 LastUpdatedTimestamp => Int

The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was last updated.


=head2 QueryTexts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of queries for featuring results.

Specific queries are mapped to specific documents for featuring in the
results. If a query contains an exact match, then one or more specific
documents are featured in the results. The exact match applies to the
full query. For example, if you only specify 'Kendra', queries such as
'How does kendra semantically rank results?' will not render the
featured results. Featured results are designed for specific queries,
rather than queries that are too broad in scope.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the set of featured results. When the value is
C<ACTIVE>, featured results are ready for use. You can still configure
your settings before setting the status to C<ACTIVE>. You can set the
status to C<ACTIVE> or C<INACTIVE> using the UpdateFeaturedResultsSet
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateFeaturedResultsSet.html)
API. The queries you specify for featured results must be unique per
featured results set for each index, whether the status is C<ACTIVE> or
C<INACTIVE>.
