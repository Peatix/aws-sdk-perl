=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::HookConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::HookConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InvocationCondition => $value, ..., S3Bucket => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::HookConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InvocationCondition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information for invoking a Lambda function
in Lambda to alter document metadata and content when ingesting
documents into Amazon Kendra. You can configure your Lambda function
using PreExtractionHookConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_CustomDocumentEnrichmentConfiguration.html)
if you want to apply advanced alterations on the original or raw
documents. If you want to apply advanced alterations on the Amazon
Kendra structured documents, you must configure your Lambda function
using PostExtractionHookConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_CustomDocumentEnrichmentConfiguration.html).
You can only invoke one Lambda function. However, this function can
invoke other functions it requires.

For more information, see Customizing document metadata during the
ingestion process
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/custom-document-enrichment.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InvocationCondition => L<Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeCondition>

The condition used for when a Lambda function should be invoked.

For example, you can specify a condition that if there are empty
date-time values, then Amazon Kendra should invoke a function that
inserts the current date-time.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LambdaArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role with permission to run a
Lambda function during ingestion. For more information, see an IAM
roles for Amazon Kendra
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/iam-roles.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Bucket => Str

Stores the original, raw documents or the structured, parsed documents
before and after altering them. For more information, see Data
contracts for Lambda functions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/custom-document-enrichment.html#cde-data-contracts-lambda).
