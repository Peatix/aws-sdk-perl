=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::ConfluenceSpaceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::ConfluenceSpaceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlArchivedSpaces => $value, ..., SpaceFieldMappings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::ConfluenceSpaceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlArchivedSpaces

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration information for indexing Confluence spaces.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlArchivedSpaces => Bool

C<TRUE> to index archived spaces.


=head2 CrawlPersonalSpaces => Bool

C<TRUE> to index personal spaces. You can add restrictions to items in
personal spaces. If personal spaces are indexed, queries without user
context information may return restricted items from a personal space
in their results. For more information, see Filtering on user context
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/user-context-filter.html).


=head2 ExcludeSpaces => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of space keys of Confluence spaces. If you include a key, the
blogs, documents, and attachments in the space are not indexed. If a
space is in both the C<ExcludeSpaces> and the C<IncludeSpaces> list,
the space is excluded.


=head2 IncludeSpaces => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of space keys for Confluence spaces. If you include a key, the
blogs, documents, and attachments in the space are indexed. Spaces that
aren't in the list aren't indexed. A space in the list must exist.
Otherwise, Amazon Kendra logs an error when the data source is
synchronized. If a space is in both the C<IncludeSpaces> and the
C<ExcludeSpaces> list, the space is excluded.


=head2 SpaceFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::ConfluenceSpaceToIndexFieldMapping>]

Maps attributes or field names of Confluence spaces to Amazon Kendra
index field names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API
before you map to Confluence fields. For more information, see Mapping
data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Confluence data source field names must exist in your Confluence custom
metadata.

If you specify the C<SpaceFieldMappings> parameter, you must specify at
least one field mapping.
