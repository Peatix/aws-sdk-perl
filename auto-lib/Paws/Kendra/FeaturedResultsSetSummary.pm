=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary information for a set of featured results. Featured results are
placed above all other results for certain queries. If there's an exact
match of a query, then one or more specific documents are featured in
the search results.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTimestamp => Int

The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was created.


=head2 FeaturedResultsSetId => Str

The identifier of the set of featured results.


=head2 FeaturedResultsSetName => Str

The name for the set of featured results.


=head2 LastUpdatedTimestamp => Int

The Unix timestamp when the set of featured results was last updated.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the set of featured results. When the value is
C<ACTIVE>, featured results are ready for use. You can still configure
your settings before setting the status to C<ACTIVE>. You can set the
status to C<ACTIVE> or C<INACTIVE> using the UpdateFeaturedResultsSet
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateFeaturedResultsSet.html)
API. The queries you specify for featured results must be unique per
