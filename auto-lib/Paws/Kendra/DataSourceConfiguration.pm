=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::DataSourceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::DataSourceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlfrescoConfiguration => $value, ..., WorkDocsConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::DataSourceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlfrescoConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information for an Amazon Kendra data
source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlfrescoConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::AlfrescoConfiguration>

Provides the configuration information to connect to Alfresco as your
data source.

Support for C<AlfrescoConfiguration> ended May 2023. We recommend
migrating to or using the Alfresco data source template schema /
TemplateConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_TemplateConfiguration.html)
API.


=head2 BoxConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::BoxConfiguration>

Provides the configuration information to connect to Box as your data

=head2 FsxConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::FsxConfiguration>

Provides the configuration information to connect to Amazon FSx as your
data source.

Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded Amazon FSx Windows connector.

You must now use the TemplateConfiguration

object instead of the C<FsxConfiguration> object to configure your
connector.

Connectors configured using the older console and API architecture will
continue to function as configured. However, you won't be able to edit
or update them. If you want to edit or update your connector
configuration, you must create a new connector.

We recommended migrating your connector workflow to the upgraded
version. Support for connectors configured using the older architecture
is scheduled to end by June 2024.
