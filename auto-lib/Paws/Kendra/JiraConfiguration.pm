=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::JiraConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::JiraConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttachmentFieldMappings => $value, ..., WorkLogFieldMappings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::JiraConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttachmentFieldMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Jira as your data
source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttachmentFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Jira attachments to Amazon Kendra index field names.
To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to
Jira fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Jira data source field names must exist in your Jira custom metadata.


=head2 CommentFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Jira comments to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Jira
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Jira data source field names must exist in your Jira custom metadata.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain file paths,
file names, and file types in your Jira data source. Files that match
the patterns are excluded from the index. Files that donE<rsquo>t match
the patterns are included in the index. If a file matches both an
inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the file isn't included in the index.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain file paths,
file names, and file types in your Jira data source. Files that match
the patterns are included in the index. Files that don't match the
patterns are excluded from the index. If a file matches both an
inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the file isn't included in the index.


=head2 IssueFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Jira issues to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Jira
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Jira data source field names must exist in your Jira custom metadata.


=head2 IssueSubEntityFilter => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify whether to crawl comments, attachments, and work logs. You can
specify one or more of these options.


=head2 IssueType => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify which issue types to crawl in your Jira data source. You can
specify one or more of these options to crawl.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JiraAccountUrl => Str

The URL of the Jira account. For example, I<company.atlassian.net>.


=head2 Project => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify which projects to crawl in your Jira data source. You can
specify one or more Jira project IDs.


=head2 ProjectFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Jira projects to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Jira
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Jira data source field names must exist in your Jira custom metadata.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a secret in Secrets Manager contains
the key-value pairs required to connect to your Jira data source. The
secret must contain a JSON structure with the following keys:

=over

=item *

jiraIdE<mdash>The Jira user name or email.

=item *

jiraCredentialsE<mdash>The Jira API token. For more information, see
Using a Jira data source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-jira.html).

=back



=head2 Status => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify which statuses to crawl in your Jira data source. You can
specify one or more of these options to crawl.


=head2 UseChangeLog => Bool

C<TRUE> to use the Jira change log to determine which documents require
updating in the index. Depending on the change log's size, it may take
longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log than to scan all of your
documents in Jira.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>

Configuration information for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to
connect to your Jira. For more information, see Configuring a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/vpc-configuration.html).


=head2 WorkLogFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Jira work logs to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Jira
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Jira data source field names must exist in your Jira custom metadata.
