=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConditionDocumentAttributeKey => $value, ..., Operator => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConditionDocumentAttributeKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The condition used for the target document attribute or metadata field
when ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra. You use this with
DocumentAttributeTarget to apply the condition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_DocumentAttributeTarget.html).

For example, you can create the 'Department' target field and have it
prefill department names associated with the documents based on
information in the 'Source_URI' field. Set the condition that if the
'Source_URI' field contains 'financial' in its URI value, then prefill
the target field 'Department' with the target value 'Finance' for the
document.

Amazon Kendra cannot create a target field if it has not already been
created as an index field. After you create your index field, you can
create a document metadata field using C<DocumentAttributeTarget>.
Amazon Kendra then will map your newly created metadata field to your
index field.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionDocumentAttributeKey => Str

The identifier of the document attribute used for the condition.

For example, 'Source_URI' could be an identifier for the attribute or
metadata field that contains source URIs associated with the documents.

Amazon Kendra currently does not support C<_document_body> as an
attribute key used for the condition.


=head2 ConditionOnValue => L<Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValue>

The value used by the operator.

For example, you can specify the value 'financial' for strings in the
'Source_URI' field that partially match or contain this value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

The condition operator.

For example, you can use 'Contains' to partially match a string.
