=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValueCountPair

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValueCountPair object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., FacetResults => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValueCountPair object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the count of documents that match a particular document
attribute or field when doing a faceted search.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => Int

The number of documents in the response that have the attribute/field
value for the key.


=head2 DocumentAttributeValue => L<Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValue>

The value of the attribute/field. For example, "HR".


=head2 FacetResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::FacetResult>]

Contains the results of a document attribute/field that is a nested
facet. A C<FacetResult> contains the counts for each facet nested
within a facet.

For example, the document attribute or facet "Department" includes a
value called "Engineering". In addition, the document attribute or
facet "SubDepartment" includes the values "Frontend" and "Backend" for
documents assigned to "Engineering". You can display nested facets in
the search results so that documents can be searched not only by
department but also by a sub department within a department. The counts
for documents that belong to "Frontend" and "Backend" within
"Engineering" are returned for a query.
