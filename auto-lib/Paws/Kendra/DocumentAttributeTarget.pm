=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TargetDocumentAttributeKey => $value, ..., TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TargetDocumentAttributeKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The target document attribute or metadata field you want to alter when
ingesting documents into Amazon Kendra.

For example, you can delete customer identification numbers associated
with the documents, stored in the document metadata field called
'Customer_ID'. You set the target key as 'Customer_ID' and the deletion
flag to C<TRUE>. This removes all customer ID values in the field
'Customer_ID'. This would scrub personally identifiable information
from each document's metadata.

Amazon Kendra cannot create a target field if it has not already been
created as an index field. After you create your index field, you can
create a document metadata field using C<DocumentAttributeTarget>.
Amazon Kendra then will map your newly created metadata field to your
index field.

You can also use this with DocumentAttributeCondition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_DocumentAttributeCondition.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TargetDocumentAttributeKey => Str

The identifier of the target document attribute or metadata field.

For example, 'Department' could be an identifier for the target
attribute or metadata field that includes the department names
associated with the documents.


=head2 TargetDocumentAttributeValue => L<Paws::Kendra::DocumentAttributeValue>

The target value you want to create for the target attribute.

For example, 'Finance' could be the target value for the target
attribute key 'Department'.


=head2 TargetDocumentAttributeValueDeletion => Bool

C<TRUE> to delete the existing target value for your specified target
attribute key. You cannot create a target value and set this to
C<TRUE>. To create a target value (C<TargetDocumentAttributeValue>),
set this to C<FALSE>.
