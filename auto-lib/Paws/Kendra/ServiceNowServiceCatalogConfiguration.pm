=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowServiceCatalogConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowServiceCatalogConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlAttachments => $value, ..., IncludeAttachmentFilePatterns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::ServiceNowServiceCatalogConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlAttachments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information for crawling service catalog
items in the ServiceNow site

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlAttachments => Bool

C<TRUE> to index attachments to service catalog items.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DocumentDataFieldName => Str

The name of the ServiceNow field that is mapped to the index document
contents field in the Amazon Kendra index.


=head2 DocumentTitleFieldName => Str

The name of the ServiceNow field that is mapped to the index document
title field.


=head2 ExcludeAttachmentFilePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain attachments of
catalogs in your ServiceNow. Item that match the patterns are excluded
from the index. Items that don't match the patterns are included in the
index. If an item matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the
exclusion pattern takes precedence and the item isn't included in the
index.

The regex is applied to the file name of the attachment.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

Maps attributes or field names of catalogs to Amazon Kendra index field
names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you
map to ServiceNow fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
ServiceNow data source field names must exist in your ServiceNow custom
metadata.


=head2 IncludeAttachmentFilePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain attachments of
catalogs in your ServiceNow. Item that match the patterns are included
in the index. Items that don't match the patterns are excluded from the
index. If an item matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the
exclusion pattern takes precedence and the item isn't included in the
index.

The regex is applied to the file name of the attachment.
