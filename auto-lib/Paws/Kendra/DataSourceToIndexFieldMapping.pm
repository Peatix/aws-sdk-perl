=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataSourceFieldName => $value, ..., IndexFieldName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataSourceFieldName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Maps attributes or field names of the documents synced from the data
source to Amazon Kendra index field names. You can set up field
mappings for each data source when calling CreateDataSource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataSource.html)
or UpdateDataSource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDataSource.html)
API. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API to first
create an index field and then map to the data source field. For more
information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataSourceFieldName => Str

The name of the field in the data source. You must first create the
index field using the C<UpdateIndex> API.


=head2 DateFieldFormat => Str

The format for date fields in the data source. If the field specified
in C<DataSourceFieldName> is a date field, you must specify the date
format. If the field is not a date field, an exception is thrown.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IndexFieldName => Str

The name of the index field to map to the data source field. The index
field type must match the data source field type.
