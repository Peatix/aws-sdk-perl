=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::GoogleDriveConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::GoogleDriveConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExcludeMimeTypes => $value, ..., SecretArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::GoogleDriveConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExcludeMimeTypes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Google Drive as
your data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExcludeMimeTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of MIME types to exclude from the index. All documents matching
the specified MIME type are excluded.

For a list of MIME types, see Using a Google Workspace Drive data
source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-google-drive.html).


=head2 ExcludeSharedDrives => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of identifiers or shared drives to exclude from the index. All
files and folders stored on the shared drive are excluded.


=head2 ExcludeUserAccounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of email addresses of the users. Documents owned by these users
are excluded from the index. Documents shared with excluded users are
indexed unless they are excluded in another way.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain items in your
Google Drive, including shared drives and users' My Drives. Items that
match the patterns are excluded from the index. Items that don't match
the patterns are included in the index. If an item matches both an
inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence
and the item isn't included in the index.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

Maps Google Drive data source attributes or field names to Amazon
Kendra index field names. To create custom fields, use the
C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Google Drive fields. For more
information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Google Drive data source field names must exist in your Google Drive
custom metadata.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain items in your
Google Drive, including shared drives and users' My Drives. Items that
match the patterns are included in the index. Items that don't match
the patterns are excluded from the index. If an item matches both an
inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence
and the item isn't included in the index.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Secrets Managersecret that contains
the credentials required to connect to Google Drive. For more
information, see Using a Google Workspace Drive data source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-google-drive.html).
