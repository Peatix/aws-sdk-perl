=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::AttributeSuggestionsDescribeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeSuggestionsMode => $value, ..., SuggestableConfigList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::AttributeSuggestionsDescribeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeSuggestionsMode

Gets information on the configuration of document fields/attributes
that you want to base query suggestions on. To change your
configuration, use AttributeSuggestionsUpdateConfig

(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The mode is set to either C<ACTIVE> or C<INACTIVE>. If the C<Mode> for
query history is set to C<ENABLED> when calling
UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig.html)
and C<AttributeSuggestionsMode> to use fields/attributes is set to
C<ACTIVE>, and you haven't set your C<SuggestionTypes> preference to
C<DOCUMENT_ATTRIBUTES>, then Amazon Kendra uses the query history.
