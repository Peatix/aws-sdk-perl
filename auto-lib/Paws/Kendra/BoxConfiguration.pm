=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::BoxConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::BoxConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CommentFieldMappings => $value, ..., WebLinkFieldMappings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::BoxConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CommentFieldMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Box as your data
source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CommentFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Box comments to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Box
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Box field names must exist in your Box custom metadata.


=head2 CrawlComments => Bool

C<TRUE> to index comments.


=head2 CrawlTasks => Bool

C<TRUE> to index the contents of tasks.


=head2 CrawlWebLinks => Bool

C<TRUE> to index web links.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnterpriseId => Str

The identifier of the Box Enterprise platform. You can find the
enterprise ID in the Box Developer Console settings or when you create
an app in Box and download your authentication credentials. For
example, I<801234567>.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain files and
folders from your Box platform. Files and folders that match the
patterns are excluded from the index.Files and folders that don't match
the patterns are included in the index. If a file or folder matches
both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the file or folder isn't included in the index.


=head2 FileFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Box files to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Box
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Box field names must exist in your Box custom metadata.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain files and
folders in your Box platform. Files and folders that match the patterns
are included in the index. Files and folders that don't match the
patterns are excluded from the index. If a file or folder matches both
an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes
precedence and the file or folder isn't included in the index.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Manager secret that
contains the key-value pairs required to connect to your Box platform.
The secret must contain a JSON structure with the following keys:

=over

=item *

clientIDE<mdash>The identifier of the client OAuth 2.0 authentication
application created in Box.

=item *

clientSecretE<mdash>A set of characters known only to the OAuth 2.0
authentication application created in Box.

=item *

publicKeyIdE<mdash>The identifier of the public key contained within an
identity certificate.

=item *

privateKeyE<mdash>A set of characters that make up an encryption key.

=item *

passphraseE<mdash>A set of characters that act like a password.

=back

You create an application in Box to generate the keys or credentials
required for the secret. For more information, see Using a Box data
source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/data-source-box.html).


=head2 TaskFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Box tasks to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Box
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Box field names must exist in your Box custom metadata.


=head2 UseChangeLog => Bool

C<TRUE> to use the Slack change log to determine which documents
require updating in the index. Depending on the data source change
log's size, it may take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log
than to scan all of your documents.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>

Configuration information for an Amazon VPC to connect to your Box. For
more information, see Configuring a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/vpc-configuration.html).


=head2 WebLinkFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of Box web links to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to Box
fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Box field names must exist in your Box custom metadata.
