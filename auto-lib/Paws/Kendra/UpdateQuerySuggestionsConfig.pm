=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $kendra = Paws->service('Kendra');
    $kendra->UpdateQuerySuggestionsConfig(
      IndexId                    => 'MyIndexId',
      AttributeSuggestionsConfig => {
        AttributeSuggestionsMode =>
          'ACTIVE',    # values: ACTIVE, INACTIVE; OPTIONAL
        SuggestableConfigList => [
          {
            AttributeName =>
              'MyDocumentAttributeKey',    # min: 1, max: 200; OPTIONAL
            Suggestable => 1,              # OPTIONAL
          },
          ...
        ],    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation => 1,            # OPTIONAL
      MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers         => 1,            # OPTIONAL
      MinimumQueryCount                    => 1,            # OPTIONAL
      Mode                                 => 'ENABLED',    # OPTIONAL

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttributeSuggestionsConfig => L<Paws::Kendra::AttributeSuggestionsUpdateConfig>

Configuration information for the document fields/attributes that you
want to base query suggestions on.



=head2 IncludeQueriesWithoutUserInformation => Bool

C<TRUE> to include queries without user information (i.e. all queries,
irrespective of the user), otherwise C<FALSE> to only include queries
with user information.

If you pass user information to Amazon Kendra along with the queries,
you can set this flag to C<FALSE> and instruct Amazon Kendra to only
consider queries with user information.

If you set to C<FALSE>, Amazon Kendra only considers queries searched
at least C<MinimumQueryCount> times across
C<MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers> unique users for suggestions.

If you set to C<TRUE>, Amazon Kendra ignores all user information and
learns from all queries.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> IndexId => Str

The identifier of the index with query suggestions you want to update.



=head2 MinimumNumberOfQueryingUsers => Int

The minimum number of unique users who must search a query in order for
the query to be eligible to suggest to your users.

Increasing this number might decrease the number of suggestions.
However, this ensures a query is searched by many users and is truly
popular to suggest to users.

How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.



=head2 MinimumQueryCount => Int

The the minimum number of times a query must be searched in order to be
eligible to suggest to your users.

Decreasing this number increases the number of suggestions. However,
this affects the quality of suggestions as it sets a low bar for a
query to be considered popular to suggest to users.

How you tune this setting depends on your specific needs.



=head2 Mode => Str

Set the mode to C<ENABLED> or C<LEARN_ONLY>.

By default, Amazon Kendra enables query suggestions. C<LEARN_ONLY> mode
allows you to turn off query suggestions. You can to update this at any
time.

In C<LEARN_ONLY> mode, Amazon Kendra continues to learn from new
queries to keep suggestions up to date for when you are ready to switch
to ENABLED mode again.

Valid values are: C<"ENABLED">, C<"LEARN_ONLY">

=head2 QueryLogLookBackWindowInDays => Int

How recent your queries are in your query log time window.

The time window is the number of days from current day to past days.

By default, Amazon Kendra sets this to 180.
