=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DisableLocalGroups => $value, ..., TenantDomain => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::OneDriveConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DisableLocalGroups

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DisableLocalGroups => Bool

C<TRUE> to disable local groups information.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain documents in
your OneDrive. Documents that match the patterns are excluded from the
index. Documents that don't match the patterns are included in the
index. If a document matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern,
the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the document isn't included
in the index.

The pattern is applied to the file name.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map OneDrive
data source attributes or field names to Amazon Kendra index field
names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you
map to OneDrive fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
OneDrive data source field names must exist in your OneDrive custom
metadata.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain documents in
your OneDrive. Documents that match the patterns are included in the
index. Documents that don't match the patterns are excluded from the
index. If a document matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern,
the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the document isn't included
in the index.

The pattern is applied to the file name.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OneDriveUsers => L<Paws::Kendra::OneDriveUsers>

A list of user accounts whose documents should be indexed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Managersecret that
contains the user name and password to connect to OneDrive. The user
name should be the application ID for the OneDrive application, and the
password is the application key for the OneDrive application.
