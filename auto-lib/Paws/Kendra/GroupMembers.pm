=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::GroupMembers

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::GroupMembers object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MemberGroups => $value, ..., S3PathforGroupMembers => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::GroupMembers object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MemberGroups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of users that belong to a group. This is useful for user context
filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their
group access to documents.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MemberGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::MemberGroup>]

A list of users that belong to a group. This can also include sub
groups. For example, the sub groups "Research", "Engineering", and
"Sales and Marketing" all belong to the group "Company A".


=head2 MemberUsers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::MemberUser>]

A list of users that belong to a group. For example, a list of interns
all belong to the "Interns" group.


=head2 S3PathforGroupMembers => L<Paws::Kendra::S3Path>

If you have more than 1000 users and/or sub groups for a single group,
you need to provide the path to the S3 file that lists your users and
sub groups for a group. Your sub groups can contain more than 1000
users, but the list of sub groups that belong to a group (and/or users)
must be no more than 1000.

You can download this example S3 file
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/samples/group_members.zip)
that uses the correct format for listing group members. Note,
C<dataSourceId> is optional. The value of C<type> for a group is always
C<GROUP> and for a user it is always C<USER>.
