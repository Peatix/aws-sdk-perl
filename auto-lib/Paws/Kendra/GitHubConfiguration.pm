=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::GitHubConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::GitHubConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExclusionFileNamePatterns => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::GitHubConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExclusionFileNamePatterns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to GitHub as your
data source.

Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded GitHub connector.

You must now use the TemplateConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_TemplateConfiguration.html)
object instead of the C<GitHubConfiguration> object to configure your
connector.

Connectors configured using the older console and API architecture will
continue to function as configured. However, you wonE<rsquo>t be able
to edit or update them. If you want to edit or update your connector
configuration, you must create a new connector.

We recommended migrating your connector workflow to the upgraded
version. Support for connectors configured using the older architecture
is scheduled to end by June 2024.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExclusionFileNamePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain file names in
your GitHub repository or repositories. File names that match the
patterns are excluded from the index. File names that don't match the
patterns are included in the index. If a file matches both an exclusion
and inclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the
file isn't included in the index.


=head2 ExclusionFileTypePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain file types in
your GitHub repository or repositories. File types that match the
patterns are excluded from the index. File types that don't match the
patterns are included in the index. If a file matches both an exclusion
and inclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the
file isn't included in the index.


=head2 ExclusionFolderNamePatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain folder names
in your GitHub repository or repositories. Folder names that match the
patterns are excluded from the index. Folder names that don't match the
patterns are included in the index. If a folder matches both an
exclusion and inclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence
and the folder isn't included in the index.


=head2 GitHubCommitConfigurationFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of GitHub commits to Amazon Kendra index field names. To
create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you map to
GitHub fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
GitHub data source field names must exist in your GitHub custom
metadata.

issues and pull requests, comments, and comment attachments.


=head2 GitHubIssueAttachmentConfigurationFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes

map to GitHub fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
GitHub data source field names must exist in your GitHub custom
metadata.


=head2 GitHubIssueCommentConfigurationFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of GitHub issue comments to Amazon Kendra index field
names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you
map to GitHub fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
GitHub data source field names must exist in your GitHub custom
metadata.


=head2 GitHubIssueDocumentConfigurationFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
or field names of GitHub issues to Amazon Kendra index field names. To

GitHub fields. For more information, see Mapping data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
GitHub data source field names must exist in your GitHub custom
metadata.


=head2 GitHubPullRequestCommentConfigurationFieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map attributes
