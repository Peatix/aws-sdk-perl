=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::CollapseConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::CollapseConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DocumentAttributeKey => $value, ..., SortingConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::CollapseConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DocumentAttributeKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies how to group results by document attribute value, and how to
display them collapsed/expanded under a designated primary document for
each group.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> DocumentAttributeKey => Str

The document attribute used to group search results. You can use any
attribute that has the C<Sortable> flag set to true. You can also sort
by any of the following built-in attributes:"_category","_created_at",
"_last_updated_at", "_version", "_view_count".


=head2 Expand => Bool

Specifies whether to expand the collapsed results.


=head2 ExpandConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::ExpandConfiguration>

Provides configuration information to customize expansion options for a
collapsed group.


=head2 MissingAttributeKeyStrategy => Str

Specifies the behavior for documents without a value for the collapse
attribute.

Amazon Kendra offers three customization options:

documents will not appear in query results.

=item *

Choose to C<EXPAND> each document with a null or missing value into a
group of its own.

=head2 SortingConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::SortingConfiguration>]

A prioritized list of document attributes/fields that determine the
primary document among those in a collapsed group.
