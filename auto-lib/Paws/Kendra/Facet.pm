=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::Facet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::Facet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DocumentAttributeKey => $value, ..., MaxResults => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::Facet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DocumentAttributeKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a document attribute or field. You can use document
attributes as facets.

For example, the document attribute or facet "Department" includes the
values "HR", "Engineering", and "Accounting". You can display these
values in the search results so that documents can be searched by
department.

You can display up to 10 facet values per facet for a query. If you
want to increase this limit, contact Support
(http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DocumentAttributeKey => Str

The unique key for the document attribute.


=head2 Facets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::Facet>]

An array of document attributes that are nested facets within a facet.

For example, the document attribute or facet "Department" includes a
value called "Engineering". In addition, the document attribute or
facet "SubDepartment" includes the values "Frontend" and "Backend" for
documents assigned to "Engineering". You can display nested facets in
the search results so that documents can be searched not only by
department but also by a sub department within a department. This helps
your users further narrow their search.

You can only have one nested facet within a facet. If you want to
increase this limit, contact Support
(http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).


=head2 MaxResults => Int

Maximum number of facet values per facet. The default is 10. You can
use this to limit the number of facet values to less than 10. If you
want to increase the default, contact Support
(http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).
