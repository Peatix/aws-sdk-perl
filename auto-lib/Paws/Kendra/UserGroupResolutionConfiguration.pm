=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::UserGroupResolutionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::UserGroupResolutionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { UserGroupResolutionMode => $value, ..., UserGroupResolutionMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::UserGroupResolutionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->UserGroupResolutionMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to get users and groups from an
IAM Identity Center identity source. This is useful for user context
filtering, where search results are filtered based on the user or their
group access to documents. You can also use the PutPrincipalMapping
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_PutPrincipalMapping.html)
API to map users to their groups so that you only need to provide the
user ID when you issue the query.

To set up an IAM Identity Center identity source in the console to use
with Amazon Kendra, see Getting started with an IAM Identity Center
identity source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/getting-started-aws-sso.html).
You must also grant the required permissions to use IAM Identity Center
with Amazon Kendra. For more information, see IAM roles for IAM
Identity Center
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-aws-sso).

Amazon Kendra currently does not support using
C<UserGroupResolutionConfiguration> with an Amazon Web Services
organization member account for your IAM Identity Center identify
source. You must create your index in the management account for the
organization in order to use C<UserGroupResolutionConfiguration>.

If you're using an Amazon Kendra Gen AI Enterprise Edition index,
C<UserGroupResolutionConfiguration> isn't supported.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UserGroupResolutionMode => Str

The identity store provider (mode) you want to use to get users and
groups. IAM Identity Center is currently the only available mode. Your
users and groups must exist in an IAM Identity Center identity source
in order to use this mode.
