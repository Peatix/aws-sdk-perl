=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::FsxConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::FsxConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExclusionPatterns => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::FsxConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExclusionPatterns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Amazon FSx as your
data source.

Amazon Kendra now supports an upgraded Amazon FSx Windows connector.

You must now use the TemplateConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/APIReference/API_TemplateConfiguration.html)
object instead of the C<FsxConfiguration> object to configure your
connector.

Connectors configured using the older console and API architecture will
continue to function as configured. However, you won't be able to edit
or update them. If you want to edit or update your connector
configuration, you must create a new connector.

We recommended migrating your connector workflow to the upgraded
version. Support for connectors configured using the older architecture
is scheduled to end by June 2024.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain files in your
Amazon FSx file system. Files that match the patterns are excluded from
the index. Files that don't match the patterns are included in the
index. If a file matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the
exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included in the
index.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map Amazon FSx
data source attributes or field names to Amazon Kendra index field
names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before you
map to Amazon FSx fields. For more information, see Mapping data source
fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Amazon FSx data source field names must exist in your Amazon FSx custom
metadata.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FileSystemId => Str

The identifier of the Amazon FSx file system.

You can find your file system ID on the file system dashboard in the
Amazon FSx console. For information on how to create a file system in
Amazon FSx console, using Windows File Server as an example, see Amazon
FSx Getting started guide
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/getting-started-step1.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FileSystemType => Str

The Amazon FSx file system type. Windows is currently the only
supported type.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain files in your
Amazon FSx file system. Files that match the patterns are included in
the index. Files that don't match the patterns are excluded from the
index. If a file matches both an inclusion and exclusion pattern, the
exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't included in the
index.


=head2 SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Secrets Manager secret that
contains the key-value pairs required to connect to your Amazon FSx
file system. Windows is currently the only supported type. The secret
must contain a JSON structure with the following keys:

=over

=item *

usernameE<mdash>The Active Directory user name, along with the Domain
Name System (DNS) domain name. For example, I<user@corp.example.com>.
The Active Directory user account must have read and mounting access to
the Amazon FSx file system for Windows.

=item *

passwordE<mdash>The password of the Active Directory user account with
read and mounting access to the Amazon FSx Windows file system.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceVpcConfiguration>

Configuration information for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud to
connect to your Amazon FSx. Your Amazon FSx instance must reside inside
your VPC.
