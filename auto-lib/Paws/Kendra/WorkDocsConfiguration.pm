=head1 NAME

Paws::Kendra::WorkDocsConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kendra::WorkDocsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlComments => $value, ..., UseChangeLog => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kendra::WorkDocsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlComments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the configuration information to connect to Amazon WorkDocs as
your data source.

Amazon WorkDocs connector is available in Oregon, North Virginia,
Sydney, Singapore and Ireland regions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlComments => Bool

C<TRUE> to include comments on documents in your index. Including
comments in your index means each comment is a document that can be
searched on.

The default is set to C<FALSE>.


=head2 ExclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain files in your
Amazon WorkDocs site repository. Files that match the patterns are
excluded from the index. Files that donE<rsquo>t match the patterns are
included in the index. If a file matches both an inclusion and
exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file
isn't included in the index.


=head2 FieldMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Kendra::DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping>]

A list of C<DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping> objects that map Amazon
WorkDocs data source attributes or field names to Amazon Kendra index
field names. To create custom fields, use the C<UpdateIndex> API before
you map to Amazon WorkDocs fields. For more information, see Mapping
data source fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/field-mapping.html). The
Amazon WorkDocs data source field names must exist in your Amazon
WorkDocs custom metadata.


=head2 InclusionPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of regular expression patterns to include certain files in your
Amazon WorkDocs site repository. Files that match the patterns are
included in the index. Files that don't match the patterns are excluded
from the index. If a file matches both an inclusion and exclusion
pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn't
included in the index.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OrganizationId => Str

The identifier of the directory corresponding to your Amazon WorkDocs
site repository.

You can find the organization ID in the Directory Service
(https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservicev2/) by going to
B<Active Directory>, then B<Directories>. Your Amazon WorkDocs site
directory has an ID, which is the organization ID. You can also set up
a new Amazon WorkDocs directory in the Directory Service console and
enable a Amazon WorkDocs site for the directory in the Amazon WorkDocs
console.


=head2 UseChangeLog => Bool

C<TRUE> to use the Amazon WorkDocs change log to determine which
documents require updating in the index. Depending on the change log's
size, it may take longer for Amazon Kendra to use the change log than
to scan all of your documents in Amazon WorkDocs.
