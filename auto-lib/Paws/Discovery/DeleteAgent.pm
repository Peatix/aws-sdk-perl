Paws::Discovery::DeleteAgent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Discovery::DeleteAgent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AgentId => $value, ..., Force => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Discovery::DeleteAgent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AgentId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing the agent or data collector to be deleted along
with the optional configurations for error handling.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AgentId => Str

The ID of the agent or data collector to delete.


=head2 Force => Bool

Optional flag used to force delete an agent or data collector. It is
needed to delete any agent in HEALTHY/UNHEALTHY/RUNNING status. Note
that deleting an agent that is actively reporting health causes it to
be re-registered with a different agent ID after data collector
re-connects with Amazon Web Services.
