=head1 NAME

Paws::Discovery::Ec2RecommendationsExportPreferences

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Discovery::Ec2RecommendationsExportPreferences object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CpuPerformanceMetricBasis => $value, ..., Tenancy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Discovery::Ec2RecommendationsExportPreferences object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CpuPerformanceMetricBasis

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates that the exported data must include EC2 instance type matches
for on-premises servers that are discovered through Amazon Web Services
Application Discovery Service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CpuPerformanceMetricBasis => L<Paws::Discovery::UsageMetricBasis>

The recommended EC2 instance type that matches the CPU usage metric of
server performance data.


=head2 Enabled => Bool

If set to true, the export preferences
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/APIReference/API_StartExportTask.html#API_StartExportTask_RequestSyntax)
is set to C<Ec2RecommendationsExportPreferences>.


=head2 ExcludedInstanceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of instance types to exclude from recommendations.


=head2 PreferredRegion => Str

The target Amazon Web Services Region for the recommendations. You can
use any of the Region codes available for the chosen service, as listed
in Amazon Web Services service endpoints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.


=head2 RamPerformanceMetricBasis => L<Paws::Discovery::UsageMetricBasis>

The recommended EC2 instance type that matches the Memory usage metric
of server performance data.


=head2 ReservedInstanceOptions => L<Paws::Discovery::ReservedInstanceOptions>

The contract type for a reserved instance. If blank, we assume an
On-Demand instance is preferred.


=head2 Tenancy => Str

The target tenancy to use for your recommended EC2 instances.
