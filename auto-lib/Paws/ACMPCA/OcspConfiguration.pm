=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ACMPCA::OcspConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., OcspCustomCname => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ACMPCA::OcspConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information to enable and configure Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

When you revoke a certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60 minutes
to reflect the new status.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Flag enabling use of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for
validating certificate revocation status.


=head2 OcspCustomCname => Str

By default, Amazon Web Services Private CA injects an Amazon Web
Services domain into certificates being validated by the Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer can alternatively use
this object to define a CNAME specifying a customized OCSP domain.

The content of a Canonical Name (CNAME) record must conform to RFC2396
(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt) restrictions on the use of
special characters in URIs. Additionally, the value of the CNAME must
not include a protocol prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

For more information, see Customizing Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/userguide/ocsp-customize.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority User Guide>.
