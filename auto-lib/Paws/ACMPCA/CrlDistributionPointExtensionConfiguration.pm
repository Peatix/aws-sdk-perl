=head1 NAME

Paws::ACMPCA::CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ACMPCA::CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OmitExtension => $value, ..., OmitExtension => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ACMPCA::CrlDistributionPointExtensionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OmitExtension

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configuration information for the default behavior of the CRL
Distribution Point (CDP) extension in certificates issued by your CA.
This extension contains a link to download the CRL, so you can check
whether a certificate has been revoked. To choose whether you want this
extension omitted or not in certificates issued by your CA, you can set
the B<OmitExtension> parameter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OmitExtension => Bool

Configures whether the CRL Distribution Point extension should be
populated with the default URL to the CRL. If set to C<true>, then the
CDP extension will not be present in any certificates issued by that CA
unless otherwise specified through CSR or API passthrough.

Only set this if you have another way to distribute the CRL
Distribution Points ffor certificates issued by your CA, such as the
Matter Distributed Compliance Ledger

This configuration cannot be enabled with a custom CNAME set.
