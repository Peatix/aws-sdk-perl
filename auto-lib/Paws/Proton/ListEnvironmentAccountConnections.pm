=head1 NAME

Paws::Proton::ListEnvironmentAccountConnections - Arguments for method ListEnvironmentAccountConnections on L<Paws::Proton>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListEnvironmentAccountConnections on the
L<AWS Proton|Paws::Proton> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListEnvironmentAccountConnections.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListEnvironmentAccountConnections.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $proton = Paws->service('Proton');
    my $ListEnvironmentAccountConnectionsOutput =
      $proton->ListEnvironmentAccountConnections(
      RequestedBy     => 'MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT',
      EnvironmentName => 'MyResourceName',       # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults      => 1,                      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken       => 'MyNextToken',          # OPTIONAL
      Statuses        => [
        'PENDING', ...    # values: PENDING, CONNECTED, REJECTED
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $EnvironmentAccountConnections =
      $ListEnvironmentAccountConnectionsOutput->EnvironmentAccountConnections;
    my $NextToken = $ListEnvironmentAccountConnectionsOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Proton::ListEnvironmentAccountConnectionsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/proton/ListEnvironmentAccountConnections>
