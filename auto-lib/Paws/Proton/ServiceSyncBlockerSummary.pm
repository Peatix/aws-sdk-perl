=head1 NAME

Paws::Proton::ServiceSyncBlockerSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Proton::ServiceSyncBlockerSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LatestBlockers => $value, ..., ServiceName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Proton::ServiceSyncBlockerSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LatestBlockers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If a service instance is manually updated, Proton wants to prevent
accidentally overriding a manual change.

A blocker is created because of the manual update or deletion of a
service instance. The summary describes the blocker as being active or
resolved.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LatestBlockers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Proton::SyncBlocker>]

The latest active blockers for the synced service.


=head2 ServiceInstanceName => Str

The name of the service instance that you want sync your service
configuration with.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceName => Str

The name of the service that you want to get the sync blocker summary
for. If given a service instance name and a service name, it will
return the blockers only applying to the instance that is blocked.

If given only a service name, it will return the blockers that apply to
all of the instances. In order to get the blockers for a single
instance, you will need to make two distinct calls, one to get the sync
blocker summary for the service and the other to get the sync blocker
for the service instance.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Proton>
