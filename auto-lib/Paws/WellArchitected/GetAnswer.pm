=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wellarchitected = Paws->service('WellArchitected');
    my $GetAnswerOutput = $wellarchitected->GetAnswer(
      LensAlias       => 'MyLensAlias',
      QuestionId      => 'MyQuestionId',
      WorkloadId      => 'MyWorkloadId',
      MilestoneNumber => 1,                # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Answer          = $GetAnswerOutput->Answer;
    my $LensAlias       = $GetAnswerOutput->LensAlias;
    my $LensArn         = $GetAnswerOutput->LensArn;
    my $MilestoneNumber = $GetAnswerOutput->MilestoneNumber;
    my $WorkloadId      = $GetAnswerOutput->WorkloadId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WellArchitected::GetAnswerOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
