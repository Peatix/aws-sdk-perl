=head1 NAME

Paws::GroundStation::TLEEphemeris

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GroundStation::TLEEphemeris object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { S3Object => $value, ..., TleData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GroundStation::TLEEphemeris object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->S3Object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Two-line element set (TLE) ephemeris.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 S3Object => L<Paws::GroundStation::S3Object>

Identifies the S3 object to be used as the ephemeris.


=head2 TleData => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GroundStation::TLEData>]

The data for a TLE ephemeris, supplied directly in the request rather
than through an S3 object.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::GroundStation>
