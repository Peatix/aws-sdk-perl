=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisVideo::ImageGenerationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KinesisVideo::ImageGenerationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationConfig => $value, ..., WidthPixels => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KinesisVideo::ImageGenerationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The structure that contains the information required for the KVS images
delivery. If null, the configuration will be deleted from the stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationConfig => L<Paws::KinesisVideo::ImageGenerationDestinationConfig>

The structure that contains the information required to deliver images
to a customer.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Format => Str

The accepted image format.


=head2 FormatConfig => L<Paws::KinesisVideo::FormatConfig>

The list of a key-value pair structure that contains extra parameters
that can be applied when the image is generated. The C<FormatConfig>
key is the C<JPEGQuality>, which indicates the JPEG quality key to be
used to generate the image. The C<FormatConfig> value accepts ints from
1 to 100. If the value is 1, the image will be generated with less
quality and the best compression. If the value is 100, the image will
be generated with the best quality and less compression. If no value is
provided, the default value of the C<JPEGQuality> key will be set to
80.


=head2 HeightPixels => Int

The height of the output image that is used in conjunction with the
C<WidthPixels> parameter. When both C<HeightPixels> and C<WidthPixels>
parameters are provided, the image will be stretched to fit the
specified aspect ratio. If only the C<HeightPixels> parameter is
provided, its original aspect ratio will be used to calculate the
C<WidthPixels> ratio. If neither parameter is provided, the original
image size will be returned.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImageSelectorType => Str

The origin of the Server or Producer timestamps to use to generate the
images.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SamplingInterval => Int

The time interval in milliseconds (ms) at which the images need to be
generated from the stream. The minimum value that can be provided is
200 ms. If the timestamp range is less than the sampling interval, the
Image from the C<StartTimestamp> will be returned if available.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Indicates whether the C<ContinuousImageGenerationConfigurations> API is
enabled or disabled.


=head2 WidthPixels => Int

The width of the output image that is used in conjunction with the
C<HeightPixels> parameter. When both C<WidthPixels> and C<HeightPixels>
parameters are provided, the image will be stretched to fit the
specified aspect ratio. If only the C<WidthPixels> parameter is
provided, its original aspect ratio will be used to calculate the
C<HeightPixels> ratio. If neither parameter is provided, the original
image size will be returned.
