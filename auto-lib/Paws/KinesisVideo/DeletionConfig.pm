=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisVideo::DeletionConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KinesisVideo::DeletionConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteAfterUpload => $value, ..., LocalSizeConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KinesisVideo::DeletionConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteAfterUpload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration details required to delete the connection of the
stream from the Edge Agent.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteAfterUpload => Bool

The C<boolean> value used to indicate whether or not you want to mark
the media for deletion, once it has been uploaded to the Kinesis Video
Stream cloud. The media files can be deleted if any of the deletion
configuration values are set to C<true>, such as when the limit for the
C<EdgeRetentionInHours>, or the C<MaxLocalMediaSizeInMB>, has been
reached.

Since the default value is set to C<true>, configure the uploader
schedule such that the media files are not being deleted before they
are initially uploaded to the Amazon Web Services cloud.


=head2 EdgeRetentionInHours => Int

The number of hours that you want to retain the data in the stream on
the Edge Agent. The default value of the retention time is 720 hours,
which translates to 30 days.


=head2 LocalSizeConfig => L<Paws::KinesisVideo::LocalSizeConfig>

The value of the local size required in order to delete the edge
configuration.
