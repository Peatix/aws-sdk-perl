=head1 NAME

Paws::KinesisVideo::ScheduleConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KinesisVideo::ScheduleConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DurationInSeconds => $value, ..., ScheduleExpression => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KinesisVideo::ScheduleConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DurationInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This API enables you to specify the duration that the camera, or local
media file, should record onto the Edge Agent. The C<ScheduleConfig>
consists of the C<ScheduleExpression> and the C<DurationInMinutes>
attributes.

If the C<ScheduleConfig> is not provided in the C<RecorderConfig>, then
the Edge Agent will always be set to recording mode.

If the C<ScheduleConfig> is not provided in the C<UploaderConfig>, then
the Edge Agent will upload at regular intervals (every 1 hour).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DurationInSeconds => Int

The total duration to record the media. If the C<ScheduleExpression>
attribute is provided, then the C<DurationInSeconds> attribute should
also be specified.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduleExpression => Str

The Quartz cron expression that takes care of scheduling jobs to record
from the camera, or local media file, onto the Edge Agent. If the
C<ScheduleExpression> is not provided for the C<RecorderConfig>, then
the Edge Agent will always be set to recording mode.

For more information about Quartz, refer to the I<Cron Trigger
Tutorial>
(http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html)
page to understand the valid expressions and its use.
