=head1 NAME

Paws::DocDBElastic::ClusterSnapshot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DocDBElastic::ClusterSnapshot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdminUserName => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroupIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DocDBElastic::ClusterSnapshot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdminUserName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns information about a specific elastic cluster snapshot.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AdminUserName => Str

The name of the elastic cluster administrator.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClusterArn => Str

The ARN identifier of the elastic cluster.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClusterCreationTime => Str

The time when the elastic cluster was created in Universal Coordinated
Time (UTC).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KmsKeyId => Str

The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
encryption key. If you are creating a cluster using the same Amazon
account that owns this KMS encryption key, you can use the KMS key
alias instead of the ARN as the KMS encryption key. If an encryption
key is not specified here, Amazon DocumentDB uses the default
encryption key that KMS creates for your account. Your account has a
different default encryption key for each Amazon Region.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SnapshotArn => Str

The ARN identifier of the elastic cluster snapshot.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SnapshotCreationTime => Str

The time when the elastic cluster snapshot was created in Universal
Coordinated Time (UTC).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SnapshotName => Str

The name of the elastic cluster snapshot.


=head2 SnapshotType => Str

The type of cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of
the following values:

=over

=item *

C<automated> - Return all cluster snapshots that Amazon DocumentDB has
automatically created for your Amazon Web Services account.

=item *

C<manual> - Return all cluster snapshots that you have manually created
for your Amazon Web Services account.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of the elastic cluster snapshot.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon EC2 subnet IDs for the elastic cluster.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VpcSecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the elastic
cluster.
