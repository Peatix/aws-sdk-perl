=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::SalesforceSourceProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::SalesforceSourceProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataTransferApi => $value, ..., Object => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::SalesforceSourceProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataTransferApi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The properties that are applied when Salesforce is being used as a
source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataTransferApi => Str

Specifies which Salesforce API is used by Amazon AppFlow when your flow
transfers data from Salesforce.

=over

=item AUTOMATIC

The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API to use based on the
number of records that your flow transfers from Salesforce. If your
flow transfers fewer than 1,000,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses
Salesforce REST API. If your flow transfers 1,000,000 records or more,
Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce Bulk API 2.0.

Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon
AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring
flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For
example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to
transfer 900,000 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day
to transfer 1,100,000 records. For each of these flow runs, the
respective Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the
differences include how dates are formatted and null values are
represented. Also, Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer Salesforce compound
fields.

By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both small
and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent formatting
in the output.

=item BULKV2

Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs
asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal for large sets of data.
By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent
output, but you optimize performance only for large data transfers.

Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields.

=item REST_SYNC

Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this option,
you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you decrease
performance for large data transfers that are better suited for Bulk
API 2.0. In some cases, if your flow attempts to transfer a vary large
set of data, it might fail wituh a timed out error.

=back



=head2 EnableDynamicFieldUpdate => Bool

The flag that enables dynamic fetching of new (recently added) fields
in the Salesforce objects while running a flow.


=head2 IncludeDeletedRecords => Bool

Indicates whether Amazon AppFlow includes deleted files in the flow
run.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Object => Str

The object specified in the Salesforce flow source.
