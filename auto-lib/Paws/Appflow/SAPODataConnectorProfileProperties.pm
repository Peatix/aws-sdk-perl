=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::SAPODataConnectorProfileProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::SAPODataConnectorProfileProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplicationHostUrl => $value, ..., PrivateLinkServiceName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::SAPODataConnectorProfileProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplicationHostUrl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The connector-specific profile properties required when using SAPOData.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationHostUrl => Str

The location of the SAPOData resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ApplicationServicePath => Str

The application path to catalog service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientNumber => Str

The client number for the client creating the connection.


=head2 DisableSSO => Bool

If you set this parameter to C<true>, Amazon AppFlow bypasses the
single sign-on (SSO) settings in your SAP account when it accesses your
SAP OData instance.

Whether you need this option depends on the types of credentials that
you applied to your SAP OData connection profile. If your profile uses
basic authentication credentials, SAP SSO can prevent Amazon AppFlow
from connecting to your account with your username and password. In
this case, bypassing SSO makes it possible for Amazon AppFlow to
connect successfully. However, if your profile uses OAuth credentials,
this parameter has no affect.


=head2 LogonLanguage => Str

The logon language of SAPOData instance.


=head2 OAuthProperties => L<Paws::Appflow::OAuthProperties>

The SAPOData OAuth properties required for OAuth type authentication.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PortNumber => Int

The port number of the SAPOData instance.


=head2 PrivateLinkServiceName => Str

The SAPOData Private Link service name to be used for private data
transfers.
