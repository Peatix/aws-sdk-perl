Paws::Appflow::DescribeConnectors - Arguments for method DescribeConnectors on L<Paws::Appflow>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeConnectors on the
L<Amazon Appflow|Paws::Appflow> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeConnectors.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeConnectors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appflow = Paws->service('Appflow');
    my $DescribeConnectorsResponse = $appflow->DescribeConnectors(
      ConnectorTypes => [
        'Salesforce',
        ... # values: Salesforce, Singular, Slack, Redshift, S3, Marketo, Googleanalytics, Zendesk, Servicenow, Datadog, Trendmicro, Snowflake, Dynatrace, Infornexus, Amplitude, Veeva, EventBridge, LookoutMetrics, Upsolver, Honeycode, CustomerProfiles, SAPOData, CustomConnector, Pardot
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ConnectorConfigurations =
      $DescribeConnectorsResponse->ConnectorConfigurations;
    my $Connectors = $DescribeConnectorsResponse->Connectors;
    my $NextToken  = $DescribeConnectorsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Appflow::DescribeConnectorsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/appflow/DescribeConnectors>
