=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::SalesforceDestinationProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::SalesforceDestinationProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataTransferApi => $value, ..., WriteOperationType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::SalesforceDestinationProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataTransferApi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The properties that are applied when Salesforce is being used as a
destination.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataTransferApi => Str

Specifies which Salesforce API is used by Amazon AppFlow when your flow
transfers data to Salesforce.

=over

=item AUTOMATIC

The default. Amazon AppFlow selects which API to use based on the
number of records that your flow transfers to Salesforce. If your flow
transfers fewer than 1,000 records, Amazon AppFlow uses Salesforce REST
API. If your flow transfers 1,000 records or more, Amazon AppFlow uses
Salesforce Bulk API 2.0.

Each of these Salesforce APIs structures data differently. If Amazon
AppFlow selects the API automatically, be aware that, for recurring
flows, the data output might vary from one flow run to the next. For
example, if a flow runs daily, it might use REST API on one day to
transfer 900 records, and it might use Bulk API 2.0 on the next day to
transfer 1,100 records. For each of these flow runs, the respective
Salesforce API formats the data differently. Some of the differences
include how dates are formatted and null values are represented. Also,
Bulk API 2.0 doesn't transfer Salesforce compound fields.

By choosing this option, you optimize flow performance for both small
and large data transfers, but the tradeoff is inconsistent formatting
in the output.

=item BULKV2

Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce Bulk API 2.0. This API runs
asynchronous data transfers, and it's optimal for large sets of data.
By choosing this option, you ensure that your flow writes consistent
output, but you optimize performance only for large data transfers.

Note that Bulk API 2.0 does not transfer Salesforce compound fields.

=item REST_SYNC

Amazon AppFlow uses only Salesforce REST API. By choosing this option,
you ensure that your flow writes consistent output, but you decrease
performance for large data transfers that are better suited for Bulk
API 2.0. In some cases, if your flow attempts to transfer a vary large
set of data, it might fail with a timed out error.

=back



=head2 ErrorHandlingConfig => L<Paws::Appflow::ErrorHandlingConfig>

The settings that determine how Amazon AppFlow handles an error when
placing data in the Salesforce destination. For example, this setting
would determine if the flow should fail after one insertion error, or
continue and attempt to insert every record regardless of the initial
failure. C<ErrorHandlingConfig> is a part of the destination connector
details.


=head2 IdFieldNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The name of the field that Amazon AppFlow uses as an ID when performing
a write operation such as update or delete.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Object => Str

The object specified in the Salesforce flow destination.


=head2 WriteOperationType => Str

This specifies the type of write operation to be performed in
Salesforce. When the value is C<UPSERT>, then C<idFieldNames> is
required.
