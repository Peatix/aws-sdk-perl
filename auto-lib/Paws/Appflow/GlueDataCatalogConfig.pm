=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::GlueDataCatalogConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::GlueDataCatalogConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatabaseName => $value, ..., TablePrefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::GlueDataCatalogConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatabaseName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration that Amazon AppFlow uses when it catalogs
your data with the Glue Data Catalog. When Amazon AppFlow catalogs your
data, it stores metadata in Data Catalog tables. This metadata
represents the data that's transferred by the flow that you configure
with these settings.

You can configure a flow with these settings only when the flow
destination is Amazon S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatabaseName => Str

The name of the Data Catalog database that stores the metadata tables
that Amazon AppFlow creates in your Amazon Web Services account. These
tables contain metadata for the data that's transferred by the flow
that you configure with this parameter.

When you configure a new flow with this parameter, you must specify an
existing database.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that grants Amazon
AppFlow the permissions it needs to create Data Catalog tables,
databases, and partitions.

For an example IAM policy that has the required permissions, see
Identity-based policy examples for Amazon AppFlow
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TablePrefix => Str

A naming prefix for each Data Catalog table that Amazon AppFlow creates
for the flow that you configure with this setting. Amazon AppFlow adds
the prefix to the beginning of the each table name.
