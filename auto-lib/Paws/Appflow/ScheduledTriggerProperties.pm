=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::ScheduledTriggerProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::ScheduledTriggerProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataPullMode => $value, ..., Timezone => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::ScheduledTriggerProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataPullMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration details of a schedule-triggered flow as
defined by the user. Currently, these settings only apply to the
C<Scheduled> trigger type.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataPullMode => Str

Specifies whether a scheduled flow has an incremental data transfer or
a complete data transfer for each flow run.


=head2 FirstExecutionFrom => Str

Specifies the date range for the records to import from the connector
in the first flow run.


=head2 FlowErrorDeactivationThreshold => Int

Defines how many times a scheduled flow fails consecutively before
Amazon AppFlow deactivates it.


=head2 ScheduleEndTime => Str

The time at which the scheduled flow ends. The time is formatted as a
timestamp that follows the ISO 8601 standard, such as
C<2022-04-27T13:00:00-07:00>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduleExpression => Str

The scheduling expression that determines the rate at which the
schedule will run, for example C<rate(5minutes)>.


=head2 ScheduleOffset => Int

Specifies the optional offset that is added to the time interval for a
schedule-triggered flow.


=head2 ScheduleStartTime => Str

The time at which the scheduled flow starts. The time is formatted as a
timestamp that follows the ISO 8601 standard, such as
C<2022-04-26T13:00:00-07:00>.


=head2 Timezone => Str

Specifies the time zone used when referring to the dates and times of a
scheduled flow, such as C<America/New_York>. This time zone is only a
descriptive label. It doesn't affect how Amazon AppFlow interprets the
timestamps that you specify to schedule the flow.

If you want to schedule a flow by using times in a particular time
zone, indicate the time zone as a UTC offset in your timestamps. For
example, the UTC offsets for the C<America/New_York> timezone are
C<-04:00> EDT and C<-05:00 EST>.
