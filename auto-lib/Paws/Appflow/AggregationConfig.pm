=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::AggregationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::AggregationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregationType => $value, ..., TargetFileSize => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::AggregationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The aggregation settings that you can use to customize the output
format of your flow data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggregationType => Str

Specifies whether Amazon AppFlow aggregates the flow records into a
single file, or leave them unaggregated.


=head2 TargetFileSize => Int

The desired file size, in MB, for each output file that Amazon AppFlow
writes to the flow destination. For each file, Amazon AppFlow attempts
to achieve the size that you specify. The actual file sizes might
differ from this target based on the number and size of the records
that each file contains.
