=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataTransferApis => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Salesforce APIs that you can have Amazon AppFlow use when your
flows transfers data to or from Salesforce.


=head2 Oauth2GrantTypesSupported => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The OAuth 2.0 grant types that Amazon AppFlow can use when it requests
an access token from Salesforce. Amazon AppFlow requires an access
token each time it attempts to access your Salesforce records.

=over

=item AUTHORIZATION_CODE

Amazon AppFlow passes an authorization code when it requests the access
token from Salesforce. Amazon AppFlow receives the authorization code
from Salesforce after you log in to your Salesforce account and
authorize Amazon AppFlow to access your records.

=item JWT_BEARER

Amazon AppFlow passes a JSON web token (JWT) when it requests the
access token from Salesforce. You provide the JWT to Amazon AppFlow
when you define the connection to your Salesforce account. When you use
this grant type, you don't need to log in to your Salesforce account to
authorize Amazon AppFlow to access your records.

=back

The CLIENT_CREDENTIALS value is not supported for Salesforce.


=head2 OAuthScopes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The desired authorization scope for the Salesforce account.
