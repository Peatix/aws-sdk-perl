Paws::Appflow::MetadataCatalogDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::MetadataCatalogDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CatalogType => $value, ..., TableRegistrationOutput => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::MetadataCatalogDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CatalogType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the metadata catalog, metadata table, and data partitions
that Amazon AppFlow used for the associated flow run.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CatalogType => Str

The type of metadata catalog that Amazon AppFlow used for the
associated flow run. This parameter returns the following value:

=over

=item GLUE

The metadata catalog is provided by the Glue Data Catalog. Glue
includes the Glue Data Catalog as a component.

=back



=head2 PartitionRegistrationOutput => L<Paws::Appflow::RegistrationOutput>

Describes the status of the attempt from Amazon AppFlow to register the
data partitions with the metadata catalog. The data partitions organize
the flow output into a hierarchical path, such as a folder path in an
S3 bucket. Amazon AppFlow creates the partitions (if they don't already
exist) based on your flow configuration.


=head2 TableName => Str

The name of the table that stores the metadata for the associated flow
run. The table stores metadata that represents the data that the flow
transferred. Amazon AppFlow stores the table in the metadata catalog.


=head2 TableRegistrationOutput => L<Paws::Appflow::RegistrationOutput>

Describes the status of the attempt from Amazon AppFlow to register the
metadata table with the metadata catalog. Amazon AppFlow creates or
updates this table for the associated flow run.
