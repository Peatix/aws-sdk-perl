=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::S3OutputFormatConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::S3OutputFormatConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AggregationConfig => $value, ..., PreserveSourceDataTyping => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::S3OutputFormatConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AggregationConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration that determines how Amazon AppFlow should format the
flow output data when Amazon S3 is used as the destination.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AggregationConfig => L<Paws::Appflow::AggregationConfig>




=head2 FileType => Str

Indicates the file type that Amazon AppFlow places in the Amazon S3
bucket.


=head2 PrefixConfig => L<Paws::Appflow::PrefixConfig>

Determines the prefix that Amazon AppFlow applies to the folder name in
the Amazon S3 bucket. You can name folders according to the flow
frequency and date.


=head2 PreserveSourceDataTyping => Bool

If your file output format is Parquet, use this parameter to set
whether Amazon AppFlow preserves the data types in your source data
when it writes the output to Amazon S3.

=over

=item *

C<true>: Amazon AppFlow preserves the data types when it writes to
Amazon S3. For example, an integer or C<1> in your source data is still
an integer in your output.

=item *

C<false>: Amazon AppFlow converts all of the source data into strings
when it writes to Amazon S3. For example, an integer of C<1> in your
source data becomes the string C<"1"> in the output.
