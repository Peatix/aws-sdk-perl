=head1 NAME

Paws::Appflow::SalesforceConnectorProfileProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Appflow::SalesforceConnectorProfileProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceUrl => $value, ..., UsePrivateLinkForMetadataAndAuthorization => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Appflow::SalesforceConnectorProfileProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceUrl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The connector-specific profile properties required when using
Salesforce.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstanceUrl => Str

The location of the Salesforce resource.


=head2 IsSandboxEnvironment => Bool

Indicates whether the connector profile applies to a sandbox or
production environment.


=head2 UsePrivateLinkForMetadataAndAuthorization => Bool

If the connection mode for the connector profile is private, this
parameter sets whether Amazon AppFlow uses the private network to send
metadata and authorization calls to Salesforce. Amazon AppFlow sends
private calls through Amazon Web Services PrivateLink. These calls
travel through Amazon Web Services infrastructure without being exposed
to the public internet.

Set either of the following values:

=over

=item true

Amazon AppFlow sends all calls to Salesforce over the private network.

These private calls are:

=over

=item *

Calls to get metadata about your Salesforce records. This metadata
describes your Salesforce objects and their fields.

=item *

Calls to get or refresh access tokens that allow Amazon AppFlow to
access your Salesforce records.

=item *

Calls to transfer your Salesforce records as part of a flow run.

=back

=item false

The default value. Amazon AppFlow sends some calls to Salesforce
privately and other calls over the public internet.

The public calls are:

=over

=item *

Calls to get metadata about your Salesforce records.

=item *

Calls to get or refresh access tokens.

=back

The private calls are:

=over

=item *

Calls to transfer your Salesforce records as part of a flow run.
