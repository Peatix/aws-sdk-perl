=head1 NAME

Paws::SecretsManager::SecretListEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecretsManager::SecretListEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecretsManager::SecretListEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the details about a secret. It does not
include the encrypted C<SecretString> and C<SecretBinary> values. To
get those values, use GetSecretValue
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_GetSecretValue.html)
.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.


=head2 CreatedDate => Str

The date and time when a secret was created.


=head2 DeletedDate => Str

The date and time the deletion of the secret occurred. Not present on
active secrets. The secret can be recovered until the number of days in
the recovery window has passed, as specified in the
C<RecoveryWindowInDays> parameter of the C<DeleteSecret>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_DeleteSecret.html)
operation.


=head2 Description => Str

The user-provided description of the secret.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt the secret
value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon Web Services managed
key C<aws/secretsmanager>, this field is omitted.


=head2 LastAccessedDate => Str

The date that the secret was last accessed in the Region. This field is
omitted if the secret has never been retrieved in the Region.


=head2 LastChangedDate => Str

The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.


=head2 LastRotatedDate => Str

The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager rotation process
was successfully completed. This value is null if the secret hasn't
ever rotated.


=head2 Name => Str

The friendly name of the secret.


=head2 NextRotationDate => Str

The next rotation is scheduled to occur on or before this date. If the
secret isn't configured for rotation or rotation has been disabled,
Secrets Manager returns null.


=head2 OwningService => Str

Returns the name of the service that created the secret.


=head2 PrimaryRegion => Str

The Region where Secrets Manager originated the secret.


=head2 RotationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether automatic, scheduled rotation is enabled for this
secret.


=head2 RotationLambdaARN => Str

The ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function invoked by Secrets
Manager to rotate and expire the secret either automatically per the
schedule or manually by a call to C<RotateSecret>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_RotateSecret.html).


=head2 RotationRules => L<Paws::SecretsManager::RotationRulesType>

A structure that defines the rotation configuration for the secret.


=head2 SecretVersionsToStages => L<Paws::SecretsManager::SecretVersionsToStagesMapType>

A list of all of the currently assigned C<SecretVersionStage> staging
labels and the C<SecretVersionId> attached to each one. Staging labels
are used to keep track of the different versions during the rotation
process.

A version that does not have any C<SecretVersionStage> is considered
deprecated and subject to deletion. Such versions are not included in
this list.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SecretsManager::Tag>]

The list of user-defined tags associated with the secret. To add tags
to a secret, use C<TagResource>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_TagResource.html).
To remove tags, use C<UntagResource>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/apireference/API_UntagResource.html).
