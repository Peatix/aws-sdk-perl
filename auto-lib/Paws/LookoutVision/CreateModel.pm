=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::CreateModel - Arguments for method CreateModel on L<Paws::LookoutVision>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateModel on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Vision|Paws::LookoutVision> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateModel.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateModel.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutvision = Paws->service('LookoutVision');
    my $CreateModelResponse = $lookoutvision->CreateModel(
      OutputConfig => {
        S3Location => {
          Bucket => 'MyS3BucketName',    # min: 3, max: 63
          Prefix => 'MyS3KeyPrefix',     # max: 1024; OPTIONAL
        },

      },
      ProjectName => 'MyProjectName',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',                # OPTIONAL
      Description => 'MyModelDescriptionMessage',    # OPTIONAL
      KmsKeyId    => 'MyKmsKeyId',                   # OPTIONAL
      Tags        => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ModelMetadata = $CreateModelResponse->ModelMetadata;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutVision::CreateModelResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lookoutvision/CreateModel>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to
C<CreateModel> completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For
example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
C<CreateModel>. In this case, safely retry your call to C<CreateModel>
by using the same C<ClientToken> parameter value.

If you don't supply a value for C<ClientToken>, the AWS SDK you are
using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
error from starting multiple training jobs. You'll need to provide your
own value for other use cases.

An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
the first request. Using a different value for C<ClientToken> is
considered a new call to C<CreateModel>. An idempotency token is active
for 8 hours.



=head2 Description => Str

A description for the version of the model.



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The identifier for your AWS KMS key. The key is used to encrypt
training and test images copied into the service for model training.
Your source images are unaffected. If this parameter is not specified,
the copied images are encrypted by a key that AWS owns and manages.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputConfig => L<Paws::LookoutVision::OutputConfig>

The location where Amazon Lookout for Vision saves the training
results.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProjectName => Str

The name of the project in which you want to create a model version.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutVision::Tag>]

A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the model.
