=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::GreengrassConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutVision::GreengrassConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompilerOptions => $value, ..., TargetPlatform => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutVision::GreengrassConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompilerOptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration information for the AWS IoT Greengrass component created
in a model packaging job. For more information, see
StartModelPackagingJob.

You can't specify a component with the same C<ComponentName> and
C<Componentversion> as an existing component with the same component
name and component version.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompilerOptions => Str

Additional compiler options for the Greengrass component. Currently,
only NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and CPU accelerators are
supported. If you specify C<TargetDevice>, don't specify
C<CompilerOptions>.

For more information, see I<Compiler options> in the Amazon Lookout for
Vision Developer Guide.


=head2 ComponentDescription => Str

A description for the AWS IoT Greengrass component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComponentName => Str

A name for the AWS IoT Greengrass component.


=head2 ComponentVersion => Str

A Version for the AWS IoT Greengrass component. If you don't provide a
value, a default value of C< I<Model Version>.0.0> is used.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3OutputLocation => L<Paws::LookoutVision::S3Location>

An S3 location in which Lookout for Vision stores the component
artifacts.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutVision::Tag>]

A set of tags (key-value pairs) that you want to attach to the AWS IoT
Greengrass component.


=head2 TargetDevice => Str

The target device for the model. Currently the only supported value is
C<jetson_xavier>. If you specify C<TargetDevice>, you can't specify
C<TargetPlatform>.


=head2 TargetPlatform => L<Paws::LookoutVision::TargetPlatform>

The target platform for the model. If you specify C<TargetPlatform>,
you can't specify C<TargetDevice>.
