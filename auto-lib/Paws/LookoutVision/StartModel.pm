=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::StartModel - Arguments for method StartModel on L<Paws::LookoutVision>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StartModel on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Vision|Paws::LookoutVision> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StartModel.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StartModel.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutvision = Paws->service('LookoutVision');
    my $StartModelResponse = $lookoutvision->StartModel(
      MinInferenceUnits => 1,
      ModelVersion      => 'MyModelVersion',
      ProjectName       => 'MyProjectName',
      ClientToken       => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
      MaxInferenceUnits => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Status = $StartModelResponse->Status;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutVision::StartModelResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lookoutvision/StartModel>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to
C<StartModel> completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For
example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
C<StartModel>. In this case, safely retry your call to C<StartModel> by
using the same C<ClientToken> parameter value.

If you don't supply a value for C<ClientToken>, the AWS SDK you are
using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
error from making multiple start requests. You'll need to provide your
own value for other use cases.

An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
the first request. Using a different value for C<ClientToken> is
considered a new call to C<StartModel>. An idempotency token is active
for 8 hours.



=head2 MaxInferenceUnits => Int

The maximum number of inference units to use for auto-scaling the
model. If you don't specify a value, Amazon Lookout for Vision doesn't
auto-scale the model.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinInferenceUnits => Int

The minimum number of inference units to use. A single inference unit
represents 1 hour of processing. Use a higher number to increase the
TPS throughput of your model. You are charged for the number of
inference units that you use.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelVersion => Str

The version of the model that you want to start.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProjectName => Str

The name of the project that contains the model that you want to start.
