=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::PixelAnomaly

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutVision::PixelAnomaly object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Color => $value, ..., TotalPercentageArea => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutVision::PixelAnomaly object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Color

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the pixels in an anomaly mask. For more information,
see Anomaly. C<PixelAnomaly> is only returned by image segmentation
models.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Color => Str

A hex color value for the mask that covers an anomaly type. Each
anomaly type has a different mask color. The color maps to the color of
the anomaly type used in the training dataset.


=head2 TotalPercentageArea => Num

The percentage area of the image that the anomaly type covers.
