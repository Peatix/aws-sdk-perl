=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::TargetPlatform

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutVision::TargetPlatform object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Accelerator => $value, ..., Os => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutVision::TargetPlatform object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Accelerator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The platform on which a model runs on an AWS IoT Greengrass core
device.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accelerator => Str

The target accelerator for the model. Currently, Amazon Lookout for
Vision only supports NVIDIA (Nvidia graphics processing unit) and CPU
accelerators. If you specify NVIDIA as an accelerator, you must also
specify the C<gpu-code>, C<trt-ver>, and C<cuda-ver> compiler options.
If you don't specify an accelerator, Lookout for Vision uses the CPU
for compilation and we highly recommend that you use the
GreengrassConfiguration$CompilerOptions field. For example, you can use
the following compiler options for CPU:

=over

=item *

C<mcpu>: CPU micro-architecture. For example, C<{'mcpu':
'skylake-avx512'}>

=item *

C<mattr>: CPU flags. For example, C<{'mattr': ['+neon', '+vfpv4']}>

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arch => Str

The target architecture for the model. The currently supported
architectures are X86_64 (64-bit version of the x86 instruction set)
and ARM_64 (ARMv8 64-bit CPU).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Os => Str

The target operating system for the model. Linux is the only operating
system that is currently supported.
