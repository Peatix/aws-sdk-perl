=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::DeleteDataset - Arguments for method DeleteDataset on L<Paws::LookoutVision>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteDataset on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Vision|Paws::LookoutVision> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteDataset.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteDataset.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutvision = Paws->service('LookoutVision');
    my $DeleteDatasetResponse = $lookoutvision->DeleteDataset(
      DatasetType => 'MyDatasetType',
      ProjectName => 'MyProjectName',
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/lookoutvision/DeleteDataset>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to
C<DeleteDataset> completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For
example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
C<DeleteDataset>. In this case, safely retry your call to
C<DeleteDataset> by using the same C<ClientToken> parameter value.

If you don't supply a value for C<ClientToken>, the AWS SDK you are
using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
error from making multiple deletetion requests. You'll need to provide
your own value for other use cases.

An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
the first request. Using a different value for C<ClientToken> is
considered a new call to C<DeleteDataset>. An idempotency token is
active for 8 hours.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetType => Str

The type of the dataset to delete. Specify C<train> to delete the
training dataset. Specify C<test> to delete the test dataset. To delete
the dataset in a single dataset project, specify C<train>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProjectName => Str

The name of the project that contains the dataset that you want to
delete.
