=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::Anomaly

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutVision::Anomaly object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., PixelAnomaly => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutVision::Anomaly object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an anomaly type found on an image by an image
segmentation model. For more information, see DetectAnomalies.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of an anomaly type found in an image. C<Name> maps to an
anomaly type in the training dataset, apart from the anomaly type
C<background>. The service automatically inserts the C<background>
anomaly type into the response from C<DetectAnomalies>.


=head2 PixelAnomaly => L<Paws::LookoutVision::PixelAnomaly>

Information about the pixel mask that covers an anomaly type.



=head1 SEE ALSO
