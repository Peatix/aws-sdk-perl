=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutVision::CreateDataset - Arguments for method CreateDataset on L<Paws::LookoutVision>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDataset on the
L<Amazon Lookout for Vision|Paws::LookoutVision> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDataset.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDataset.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lookoutvision = Paws->service('LookoutVision');
    my $CreateDatasetResponse = $lookoutvision->CreateDataset(
      DatasetType   => 'MyDatasetType',
      ProjectName   => 'MyProjectName',
      ClientToken   => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
      DatasetSource => {
        GroundTruthManifest => {
          S3Object => {
            Bucket    => 'MyS3BucketName',       # min: 3, max: 63
            Key       => 'MyS3ObjectKey',        # min: 1, max: 1024
            VersionId => 'MyS3ObjectVersion',    # min: 1, max: 1024; OPTIONAL
          },    # OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DatasetMetadata = $CreateDatasetResponse->DatasetMetadata;

    # Returns a L<Paws::LookoutVision::CreateDatasetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientToken => Str

ClientToken is an idempotency token that ensures a call to
C<CreateDataset> completes only once. You choose the value to pass. For
example, An issue might prevent you from getting a response from
C<CreateDataset>. In this case, safely retry your call to
C<CreateDataset> by using the same C<ClientToken> parameter value.

If you don't supply a value for C<ClientToken>, the AWS SDK you are
using inserts a value for you. This prevents retries after a network
error from making multiple dataset creation requests. You'll need to
provide your own value for other use cases.

An error occurs if the other input parameters are not the same as in
the first request. Using a different value for C<ClientToken> is
considered a new call to C<CreateDataset>. An idempotency token is
active for 8 hours.



=head2 DatasetSource => L<Paws::LookoutVision::DatasetSource>

The location of the manifest file that Amazon Lookout for Vision uses
to create the dataset.

If you don't specify C<DatasetSource>, an empty dataset is created and
the operation synchronously returns. Later, you can add JSON Lines by
calling UpdateDatasetEntries.

If you specify a value for C<DataSource>, the manifest at the S3
location is validated and used to create the dataset. The call to
C<CreateDataset> is asynchronous and might take a while to complete. To
find out the current status, Check the value of C<Status> returned in a
call to DescribeDataset.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatasetType => Str

The type of the dataset. Specify C<train> for a training dataset.
Specify C<test> for a test dataset.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProjectName => Str

The name of the project in which you want to create a dataset.
