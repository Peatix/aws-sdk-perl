=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryComputeRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryComputeRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeMode => $value, ..., ProvisionedCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryComputeRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A request to retrieve or update the compute capacity settings for
querying data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComputeMode => Str

utilized within an account. Note that in the Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
region, the API operation only recognizes the value C<PROVISIONED>.


=head2 ProvisionedCapacity => L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::ProvisionedCapacityRequest>

Configuration object that contains settings for provisioned Timestream
Compute Units (TCUs) in your account.
