=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryTemporalRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryTemporalRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Max => $value, ..., Max => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryTemporalRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Max

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides insights into the temporal range of the query, including the
table with the largest (max) time range.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Max => L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryTemporalRangeMax>

Encapsulates the following properties that provide insights into the

=over

=item *

C<Value> E<ndash> The maximum duration in nanoseconds between the start
and end of the query.

=item *
