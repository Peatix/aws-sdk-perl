=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::QuerySpatialCoverageMax

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::QuerySpatialCoverageMax object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PartitionKey => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::QuerySpatialCoverageMax object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PartitionKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides insights into the table with the most sub-optimal spatial
range scanned by your query.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PartitionKey => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The partition key used for partitioning, which can be a default
C<measure_name> or a customer defined partition key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/customer-defined-partition-keys.html).


=head2 TableArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table with the most sub-optimal
spatial pruning.


=head2 Value => Num

The maximum ratio of spatial coverage.
