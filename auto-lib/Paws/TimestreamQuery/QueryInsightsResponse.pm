=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryInsightsResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryInsightsResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OutputBytes => $value, ..., UnloadWrittenRows => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryInsightsResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OutputBytes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides various insights and metrics related to the query that you
executed.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OutputBytes => Int

Indicates the size of query result set in bytes. You can use this data
to validate if the result set has changed as part of the query tuning
exercise.


=head2 OutputRows => Int

Indicates the total number of rows returned as part of the query result
set. You can use this data to validate if the number of rows in the
result set have changed as part of the query tuning exercise.


=head2 QuerySpatialCoverage => L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::QuerySpatialCoverage>

Provides insights into the spatial coverage of the query, including the
table with sub-optimal (max) spatial pruning. This information can help
you identify areas for improvement in your partitioning strategy to
enhance spatial pruning.


=head2 QueryTableCount => Int

Indicates the number of tables in the query.


=head2 QueryTemporalRange => L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::QueryTemporalRange>

Provides insights into the temporal range of the query, including the
table with the largest (max) time range. Following are some of the
potential options for optimizing time-based pruning:

=over

=item *

Add missing time-predicates.

=item *

Remove functions around the time predicates.

=item *

Add time predicates to all the sub-queries.

=back



=head2 UnloadPartitionCount => Int

Indicates the partitions created by the C<Unload> operation.


=head2 UnloadWrittenBytes => Int

Indicates the size, in bytes, written by the C<Unload> operation.


=head2 UnloadWrittenRows => Int

Indicates the rows written by the C<Unload> query.
