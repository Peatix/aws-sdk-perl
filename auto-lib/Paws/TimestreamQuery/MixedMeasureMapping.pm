=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::MixedMeasureMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::MixedMeasureMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MeasureName => $value, ..., TargetMeasureName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::MixedMeasureMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MeasureName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

MixedMeasureMappings are mappings that can be used to ingest data into
a mixture of narrow and multi measures in the derived table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MeasureName => Str

Refers to the value of measure_name in a result row. This field is
required if MeasureNameColumn is provided.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MeasureValueType => Str

Type of the value that is to be read from sourceColumn. If the mapping
is for MULTI, use MeasureValueType.MULTI.


=head2 MultiMeasureAttributeMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureAttributeMapping>]

Required when measureValueType is MULTI. Attribute mappings for MULTI
value measures.


=head2 SourceColumn => Str

This field refers to the source column from which measure-value is to
be read for result materialization.


=head2 TargetMeasureName => Str

Target measure name to be used. If not provided, the target measure
name by default would be measure-name if provided, or sourceColumn
otherwise.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::TimestreamQuery>
