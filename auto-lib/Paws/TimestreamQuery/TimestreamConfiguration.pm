=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::TimestreamConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::TimestreamConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatabaseName => $value, ..., TimeColumn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::TimestreamConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatabaseName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration to write data into Timestream database and table. This
configuration allows the user to map the query result select columns
into the destination table columns.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DatabaseName => Str

Name of Timestream database to which the query result will be written.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DimensionMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::DimensionMapping>]

This is to allow mapping column(s) from the query result to the
dimension in the destination table.


=head2 MeasureNameColumn => Str

Name of the measure column.


=head2 MixedMeasureMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::MixedMeasureMapping>]

Specifies how to map measures to multi-measure records.


=head2 MultiMeasureMappings => L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureMappings>

Multi-measure mappings.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TableName => Str

Name of Timestream table that the query result will be written to. The
table should be within the same database that is provided in Timestream
configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeColumn => Str

Column from query result that should be used as the time column in
destination table. Column type for this should be TIMESTAMP.
