=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureMappings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureMappings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MultiMeasureAttributeMappings => $value, ..., TargetMultiMeasureName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureMappings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MultiMeasureAttributeMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Only one of MixedMeasureMappings or MultiMeasureMappings is to be
provided. MultiMeasureMappings can be used to ingest data as multi
measures in the derived table.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MultiMeasureAttributeMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::TimestreamQuery::MultiMeasureAttributeMapping>]

Required. Attribute mappings to be used for mapping query results to
ingest data for multi-measure attributes.


=head2 TargetMultiMeasureName => Str

The name of the target multi-measure name in the derived table. This
input is required when measureNameColumn is not provided. If
MeasureNameColumn is provided, then value from that column will be used
as multi-measure name.
