=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::DomainEntryPoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeArtifact::DomainEntryPoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExternalConnectionName => $value, ..., RepositoryName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeArtifact::DomainEntryPoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExternalConnectionName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about how a package originally entered the CodeArtifact
domain. For packages published directly to CodeArtifact, the entry
point is the repository it was published to. For packages ingested from
an external repository, the entry point is the external connection that
it was ingested from. An external connection is a CodeArtifact
repository that is connected to an external repository such as the npm
registry or NuGet gallery.

If a package version exists in a repository and is updated, for example
if a package of the same version is added with additional assets, the
package version's C<DomainEntryPoint> will not change from the original
package version's value.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExternalConnectionName => Str

The name of the external connection that a package was ingested from.


=head2 RepositoryName => Str

The name of the repository that a package was originally published to.
