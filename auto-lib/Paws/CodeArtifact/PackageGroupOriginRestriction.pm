=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::PackageGroupOriginRestriction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeArtifact::PackageGroupOriginRestriction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EffectiveMode => $value, ..., RepositoriesCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeArtifact::PackageGroupOriginRestriction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EffectiveMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the configured restrictions of the origin
controls of a package group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EffectiveMode => Str

The effective package group origin restriction setting. If the value of
C<mode> is C<ALLOW>, C<ALLOW_SPECIFIC_REPOSITORIES>, or C<BLOCK>, then
the value of C<effectiveMode> is the same. Otherwise, when the value of
C<mode> is C<INHERIT>, then the value of C<effectiveMode> is the value
of C<mode> of the first parent group which does not have a value of
C<INHERIT>.


=head2 InheritedFrom => L<Paws::CodeArtifact::PackageGroupReference>

The parent package group that the package group origin restrictions are
inherited from.


=head2 Mode => Str

The package group origin restriction setting. If the value of C<mode>
is C<ALLOW>, C<ALLOW_SPECIFIC_REPOSITORIES>, or C<BLOCK>, then the
value of C<effectiveMode> is the same. Otherwise, when the value is
C<INHERIT>, then the value of C<effectiveMode> is the value of C<mode>
of the first parent group which does not have a value of C<INHERIT>.


=head2 RepositoriesCount => Int

The number of repositories in the allowed repository list.
