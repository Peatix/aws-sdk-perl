Paws::CodeArtifact::DisassociateExternalConnection - Arguments for method DisassociateExternalConnection on L<Paws::CodeArtifact>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DisassociateExternalConnection on the
L<CodeArtifact|Paws::CodeArtifact> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DisassociateExternalConnection.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DisassociateExternalConnection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeartifact = Paws->service('CodeArtifact');
    my $DisassociateExternalConnectionResult =
      $codeartifact->DisassociateExternalConnection(
      Domain             => 'MyDomainName',
      ExternalConnection => 'MyExternalConnectionName',
      Repository         => 'MyRepositoryName',
      DomainOwner        => 'MyAccountId',                # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $Repository = $DisassociateExternalConnectionResult->Repository;

 # Returns a L<Paws::CodeArtifact::DisassociateExternalConnectionResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
