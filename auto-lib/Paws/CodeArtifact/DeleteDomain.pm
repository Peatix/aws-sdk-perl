=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::DeleteDomain - Arguments for method DeleteDomain on L<Paws::CodeArtifact>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteDomain on the
L<CodeArtifact|Paws::CodeArtifact> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteDomain.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteDomain.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeartifact = Paws->service('CodeArtifact');
    my $DeleteDomainResult = $codeartifact->DeleteDomain(
      Domain      => 'MyDomainName',
      DomainOwner => 'MyAccountId',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Domain = $DeleteDomainResult->Domain;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeArtifact::DeleteDomainResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
