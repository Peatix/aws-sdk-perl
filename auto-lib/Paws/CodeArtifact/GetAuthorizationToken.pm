=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::GetAuthorizationToken - Arguments for method GetAuthorizationToken on L<Paws::CodeArtifact>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetAuthorizationToken on the
L<CodeArtifact|Paws::CodeArtifact> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetAuthorizationToken.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetAuthorizationToken.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeartifact = Paws->service('CodeArtifact');
    my $GetAuthorizationTokenResult = $codeartifact->GetAuthorizationToken(
      Domain          => 'MyDomainName',
      DomainOwner     => 'MyAccountId',    # OPTIONAL
      DurationSeconds => 1,                # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AuthorizationToken = $GetAuthorizationTokenResult->AuthorizationToken;
    my $Expiration         = $GetAuthorizationTokenResult->Expiration;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodeArtifact::GetAuthorizationTokenResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codeartifact/GetAuthorizationToken>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Domain => Str

The name of the domain that is in scope for the generated authorization
token.



=head2 DomainOwner => Str

The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account that
owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.



=head2 DurationSeconds => Int

The time, in seconds, that the generated authorization token is valid.
Valid values are C<0> and any number between C<900> (15 minutes) and
C<43200> (12 hours). A value of C<0> will set the expiration of the
authorization token to the same expiration of the user's role's
temporary credentials.
