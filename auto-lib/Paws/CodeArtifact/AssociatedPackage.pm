=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::AssociatedPackage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeArtifact::AssociatedPackage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociationType => $value, ..., Package => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeArtifact::AssociatedPackage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociationType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A package associated with a package group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociationType => Str

Describes the strength of the association between the package and
package group. A strong match can be thought of as an exact match, and
a weak match can be thought of as a variation match, for example, the
package name matches a variation of the package group pattern. For more
information about package group pattern matching, including strong and
weak matches, see Package group definition syntax and matching behavior
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/package-group-definition-syntax-matching-behavior.html)
in the I<CodeArtifact User Guide>.


=head2 Format => Str

A format that specifies the type of the associated package.


=head2 Namespace => Str

The namespace of the associated package. The package component that
specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

=over

=item *

The namespace of a Maven package version is its C<groupId>.

=item *

The namespace of an npm or Swift package version is its C<scope>.

=item *

The namespace of a generic package is its C<namespace>.

=item *

Python, NuGet, Ruby, and Cargo package versions do not contain a
corresponding component, package versions of those formats do not have
a namespace.

=back



=head2 Package => Str

The name of the associated package.
