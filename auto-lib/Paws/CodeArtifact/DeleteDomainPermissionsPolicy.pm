=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeArtifact::DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy - Arguments for method DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy on L<Paws::CodeArtifact>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy on the
L<CodeArtifact|Paws::CodeArtifact> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codeartifact = Paws->service('CodeArtifact');
    my $DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicyResult =
      $codeartifact->DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy(
      Domain         => 'MyDomainName',
      DomainOwner    => 'MyAccountId',         # OPTIONAL
      PolicyRevision => 'MyPolicyRevision',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $Policy = $DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicyResult->Policy;

  # Returns a L<Paws::CodeArtifact::DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicyResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/codeartifact/DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy>
