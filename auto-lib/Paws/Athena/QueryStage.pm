=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::QueryStage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::QueryStage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExecutionTime => $value, ..., SubStages => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::QueryStage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExecutionTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Stage statistics such as input and output rows and bytes, execution
time and stage state. This information also includes substages and the
query stage plan.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExecutionTime => Int

Time taken to execute this stage.


=head2 InputBytes => Int

The number of bytes input into the stage for execution.


=head2 InputRows => Int

The number of rows input into the stage for execution.


=head2 OutputBytes => Int

The number of bytes output from the stage after execution.


=head2 OutputRows => Int

The number of rows output from the stage after execution.


=head2 QueryStagePlan => L<Paws::Athena::QueryStagePlanNode>

Stage plan information such as name, identifier, sub plans, and source
stages.


=head2 StageId => Int

The identifier for a stage.


=head2 State => Str

State of the stage after query execution.


=head2 SubStages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Athena::QueryStage>]

List of sub query stages that form this stage execution plan.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Athena>
