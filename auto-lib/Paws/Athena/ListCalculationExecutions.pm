=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ListCalculationExecutions - Arguments for method ListCalculationExecutions on L<Paws::Athena>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListCalculationExecutions on the
L<Amazon Athena|Paws::Athena> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListCalculationExecutions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListCalculationExecutions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $athena = Paws->service('Athena');
    my $ListCalculationExecutionsResponse = $athena->ListCalculationExecutions(
      SessionId   => 'MySessionId',
      MaxResults  => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      NextToken   => 'MySessionManagerToken',    # OPTIONAL
      StateFilter => 'CREATING',                 # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Calculations = $ListCalculationExecutionsResponse->Calculations;
    my $NextToken    = $ListCalculationExecutionsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Athena::ListCalculationExecutionsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/athena/ListCalculationExecutions>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of calculation executions to return.



=head2 NextToken => Str

A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to
continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
next set of pages, pass in the C<NextToken> from the response object of
the previous page call.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SessionId => Str

The session ID.



=head2 StateFilter => Str

A filter for a specific calculation execution state. A description of
each state follows.

C<CREATING> - The calculation is in the process of being created.

C<CREATED> - The calculation has been created and is ready to run.

C<QUEUED> - The calculation has been queued for processing.

C<RUNNING> - The calculation is running.

C<CANCELING> - A request to cancel the calculation has been received
and the system is working to stop it.

C<CANCELED> - The calculation is no longer running as the result of a
cancel request.

C<COMPLETED> - The calculation has completed without error.

C<FAILED> - The calculation failed and is no longer running.

Valid values are: C<"CREATING">, C<"CREATED">, C<"QUEUED">, C<"RUNNING">, C<"CANCELING">, C<"CANCELED">, C<"COMPLETED">, C<"FAILED">
