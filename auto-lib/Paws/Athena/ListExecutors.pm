=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ListExecutors - Arguments for method ListExecutors on L<Paws::Athena>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListExecutors on the
L<Amazon Athena|Paws::Athena> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListExecutors.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListExecutors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $athena = Paws->service('Athena');
    my $ListExecutorsResponse = $athena->ListExecutors(
      SessionId           => 'MySessionId',
      ExecutorStateFilter => 'CREATING',                 # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults          => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      NextToken           => 'MySessionManagerToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ExecutorsSummary = $ListExecutorsResponse->ExecutorsSummary;
    my $NextToken        = $ListExecutorsResponse->NextToken;
    my $SessionId        = $ListExecutorsResponse->SessionId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Athena::ListExecutorsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/athena/ListExecutors>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExecutorStateFilter => Str

A filter for a specific executor state. A description of each state

C<CREATED> - The executor has been started.

C<REGISTERED> - The executor has been registered.

C<TERMINATING> - The executor is in the process of shutting down.

C<TERMINATED> - The executor is no longer running.

C<FAILED> - Due to a failure, the executor is no longer running.

Valid values are: C<"CREATING">, C<"CREATED">, C<"REGISTERED">, C<"TERMINATING">, C<"TERMINATED">, C<"FAILED">

=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of executors to return.



=head2 NextToken => Str

A token generated by the Athena service that specifies where to
continue pagination if a previous request was truncated. To obtain the
next set of pages, pass in the C<NextToken> from the response object of
the previous page call.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SessionId => Str

The session ID.
