=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::Tag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::Tag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::Tag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A label that you assign to a resource. Athena resources include
workgroups, data catalogs, and capacity reservations. Each tag consists
of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example,
you can use tags to categorize Athena resources by purpose, owner, or
environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to
search and filter the resources in your account. For best practices,
see Tagging Best Practices
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/tagging-best-practices/tagging-best-practices.html).
Tag keys can be from 1 to 128 UTF-8 Unicode characters, and tag values
can be from 0 to 256 UTF-8 Unicode characters. Tags can use letters and
numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _
: / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique
per resource. If you specify more than one tag, separate them by
commas.
