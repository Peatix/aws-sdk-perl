=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::EngineConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::EngineConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalConfigs => $value, ..., SparkProperties => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::EngineConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalConfigs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains data processing unit (DPU) configuration settings and
parameter mappings for a notebook engine.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalConfigs => L<Paws::Athena::ParametersMap>

Contains additional notebook engine C<MAPE<lt>string, stringE<gt>>
parameter mappings in the form of key-value pairs. To specify an Athena
notebook that the Jupyter server will download and serve, specify a
value for the StartSessionRequest$NotebookVersion field, and then add a
key named C<NotebookId> to C<AdditionalConfigs> that has the value of
the Athena notebook ID.


=head2 CoordinatorDpuSize => Int

The number of DPUs to use for the coordinator. A coordinator is a
special executor that orchestrates processing work and manages other
executors in a notebook session. The default is 1.


=head2 DefaultExecutorDpuSize => Int

The default number of DPUs to use for executors. An executor is the
smallest unit of compute that a notebook session can request from
Athena. The default is 1.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxConcurrentDpus => Int

The maximum number of DPUs that can run concurrently.


=head2 SparkProperties => L<Paws::Athena::ParametersMap>

Specifies custom jar files and Spark properties for use cases like
cluster encryption, table formats, and general Spark tuning.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Athena>
