=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::WorkGroupConfigurationUpdates

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::WorkGroupConfigurationUpdates object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalConfiguration => $value, ..., ResultConfigurationUpdates => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::WorkGroupConfigurationUpdates object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration information that will be updated for this workgroup,
which includes the location in Amazon S3 where query and calculation
results are stored, the encryption option, if any, used for query
results, whether the Amazon CloudWatch Metrics are enabled for the
workgroup, whether the workgroup settings override the client-side
settings, and the data usage limit for the amount of bytes scanned per
query, if it is specified.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalConfiguration => Str

Contains a user defined string in JSON format for a Spark-enabled
workgroup.


=head2 BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery => Int

The upper limit (cutoff) for the amount of bytes a single query in a
workgroup is allowed to scan.


=head2 CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::Athena::CustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration>




=head2 EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration => Bool

Enforces a minimal level of encryption for the workgroup for query and
calculation results that are written to Amazon S3. When enabled,
workgroup users can set encryption only to the minimum level set by the
administrator or higher when they submit queries. This setting does not
apply to Spark-enabled workgroups.

The C<EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration> setting takes precedence over the
C<EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration> flag. This means that if
C<EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration> is true, the
C<EnableMinimumEncryptionConfiguration> flag is ignored, and the
workgroup configuration for encryption is used.


=head2 EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration => Bool

If set to "true", the settings for the workgroup override client-side
settings. If set to "false" client-side settings are used. For more
information, see Workgroup Settings Override Client-Side Settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html).


=head2 EngineVersion => L<Paws::Athena::EngineVersion>

The engine version requested when a workgroup is updated. After the
update, all queries on the workgroup run on the requested engine
version. If no value was previously set, the default is Auto. Queries
on the C<AmazonAthenaPreviewFunctionality> workgroup run on the preview
engine regardless of this setting.


=head2 ExecutionRole => Str

The ARN of the execution role used to access user resources for Spark
sessions and Identity Center enabled workgroups. This property applies
only to Spark enabled workgroups and Identity Center enabled
workgroups.


=head2 PublishCloudWatchMetricsEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether this workgroup enables publishing metrics to Amazon
CloudWatch.


=head2 QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration => L<Paws::Athena::QueryResultsS3AccessGrantsConfiguration>

Specifies whether Amazon S3 access grants are enabled for query
results.


=head2 RemoveBytesScannedCutoffPerQuery => Bool

Indicates that the data usage control limit per query is removed.
WorkGroupConfiguration$BytesScannedCutoffPerQuery


=head2 RemoveCustomerContentEncryptionConfiguration => Bool

Removes content encryption configuration from an Apache Spark-enabled
Athena workgroup.


=head2 RequesterPaysEnabled => Bool

If set to C<true>, allows members assigned to a workgroup to specify
Amazon S3 Requester Pays buckets in queries. If set to C<false>,
workgroup members cannot query data from Requester Pays buckets, and
queries that retrieve data from Requester Pays buckets cause an error.
The default is C<false>. For more information about Requester Pays
buckets, see Requester Pays Buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 ResultConfigurationUpdates => L<Paws::Athena::ResultConfigurationUpdates>

The result configuration information about the queries in this
workgroup that will be updated. Includes the updated results location
and an updated option for encrypting query results.
