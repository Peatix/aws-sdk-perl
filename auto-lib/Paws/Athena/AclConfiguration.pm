Paws::Athena::AclConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::AclConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { S3AclOption => $value, ..., S3AclOption => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::AclConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->S3AclOption

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to control
ownership of stored query results, including data files inserted by
Athena as the result of statements like CTAS or INSERT INTO. When
Athena stores query results in Amazon S3, the canned ACL is set with
the C<x-amz-acl> request header. For more information about S3 Object
Ownership, see Object Ownership settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/about-object-ownership.html#object-ownership-overview)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3AclOption => Str

The Amazon S3 canned ACL that Athena should specify when storing query
results, including data files inserted by Athena as the result of
statements like CTAS or INSERT INTO. Currently the only supported
canned ACL is C<BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL>. If a query runs in a
workgroup and the workgroup overrides client-side settings, then the
Amazon S3 canned ACL specified in the workgroup's settings is used for
all queries that run in the workgroup. For more information about
Amazon S3 canned ACLs, see Canned ACL
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.
