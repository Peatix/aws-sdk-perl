=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::DataCatalog

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::DataCatalog object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConnectionType => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::DataCatalog object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConnectionType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a data catalog in an Amazon Web Services
account.

In the Athena console, data catalogs are listed as "data sources" on
the B<Data sources> page under the B<Data source name> column.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConnectionType => Str

The type of connection for a C<FEDERATED> data catalog (for example,
C<REDSHIFT>, C<MYSQL>, or C<SQLSERVER>). For information about
individual connectors, see Available data source connectors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connectors-available.html).


=head2 Description => Str

An optional description of the data catalog.


=head2 Error => Str

Text of the error that occurred during data catalog creation or
deletion.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the data catalog. The catalog name must be unique for the
Amazon Web Services account and can use a maximum of 127 alphanumeric,
underscore, at sign, or hyphen characters. The remainder of the length
constraint of 256 is reserved for use by Athena.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::Athena::ParametersMap>

Specifies the Lambda function or functions to use for the data catalog.
This is a mapping whose values depend on the catalog type.

=over

=item *

For the C<HIVE> data catalog type, use the following syntax. The
C<metadata-function> parameter is required. C<The sdk-version>
parameter is optional and defaults to the currently supported version.

C<metadata-function=I<lambda_arn>, sdk-version=I<version_number>>

=item *

For the C<LAMBDA> data catalog type, use one of the following sets of
required parameters, but not both.

=over

=item *

If you have one Lambda function that processes metadata and another for
reading the actual data, use the following syntax. Both parameters are
required.

C<metadata-function=I<lambda_arn>, record-function=I<lambda_arn>>

=item *

If you have a composite Lambda function that processes both metadata
and data, use the following syntax to specify your Lambda function.

C<function=I<lambda_arn>>

=back

=item *

The C<GLUE> type takes a catalog ID parameter and is required. The C<
I<catalog_id> > is the account ID of the Amazon Web Services account to
which the Glue catalog belongs.

C<catalog-id=I<catalog_id>>

=over

=item *

The C<GLUE> data catalog type also applies to the default
C<AwsDataCatalog> that already exists in your account, of which you can
have only one and cannot modify.

=back

=item *

The C<FEDERATED> data catalog type uses one of the following
parameters, but not both. Use C<connection-arn> for an existing Glue
connection. Use C<connection-type> and C<connection-properties> to
specify the configuration setting for a new connection.

=over

=item *

C<connection-arn:I<E<lt>glue_connection_arn_to_reuseE<gt>>>

=item *

C<connection-type:MYSQL|REDSHIFT|....,
connection-properties:"I<E<lt>json_stringE<gt>>">

For I< C<E<lt>json_stringE<gt>> >, use escaped JSON text, as in the
following example.

C<"{\"spill_bucket\":\"my_spill\",\"spill_prefix\":\"athena-spill\",\"host\":\"abc12345.snowflakecomputing.com\",\"port\":\"1234\",\"warehouse\":\"DEV_WH\",\"database\":\"TEST\",\"schema\":\"PUBLIC\",\"SecretArn\":\"arn:aws:secretsmanager:ap-south-1:111122223333:secret:snowflake-XHb67j\"}">

=head2 Status => Str

The status of the creation or deletion of the data catalog.

=over

=item *

The C<LAMBDA>, C<GLUE>, and C<HIVE> data catalog types are created
synchronously. Their status is either C<CREATE_COMPLETE> or
C<CREATE_FAILED>.

=item *

The C<FEDERATED> data catalog type is created asynchronously.

=back

Data catalog creation status:

=over

=item *

C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS>: Federated data catalog creation in progress.

=item *

C<CREATE_COMPLETE>: Data catalog creation complete.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED>: Data catalog could not be created.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED_CLEANUP_IN_PROGRESS>: Federated data catalog creation
failed and is being removed.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED_CLEANUP_COMPLETE>: Federated data catalog creation
failed and was removed.

=item *

C<CREATE_FAILED_CLEANUP_FAILED>: Federated data catalog creation failed
but could not be removed.

=back

Data catalog deletion status:

=over

=item *

C<DELETE_IN_PROGRESS>: Federated data catalog deletion in progress.

=item *

C<DELETE_COMPLETE>: Federated data catalog deleted.

=item *

C<DELETE_FAILED>: Federated data catalog could not be deleted.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of data catalog to create: C<LAMBDA> for a federated catalog,
C<GLUE> for an Glue Data Catalog, and C<HIVE> for an external Apache
Hive metastore. C<FEDERATED> is a federated catalog for which Athena
creates the connection and the Lambda function for you based on the
parameters that you pass.
