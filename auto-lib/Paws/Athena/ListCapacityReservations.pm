=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $athena = Paws->service('Athena');
    my $ListCapacityReservationsOutput = $athena->ListCapacityReservations(
      MaxResults => 1,            # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $CapacityReservations =
      $ListCapacityReservationsOutput->CapacityReservations;
    my $NextToken = $ListCapacityReservationsOutput->NextToken;
