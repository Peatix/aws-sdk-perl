=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ExecutorsSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::ExecutorsSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExecutorId => $value, ..., TerminationDateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::ExecutorsSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExecutorId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains summary information about an executor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExecutorId => Str

The UUID of the executor.


=head2 ExecutorSize => Int

The smallest unit of compute that a session can request from Athena.
Size is measured in data processing unit (DPU) values, a relative
measure of processing power.


=head2 ExecutorState => Str

The processing state of the executor. A description of each state
follows.

C<CREATING> - The executor is being started, including acquiring
resources.

C<CREATED> - The executor has been started.

C<REGISTERED> - The executor has been registered.

C<TERMINATING> - The executor is in the process of shutting down.

C<TERMINATED> - The executor is no longer running.

C<FAILED> - Due to a failure, the executor is no longer running.


=head2 ExecutorType => Str

The type of executor used for the application (C<COORDINATOR>,
C<GATEWAY>, or C<WORKER>).


=head2 StartDateTime => Int

The date and time that the executor started.


=head2 TerminationDateTime => Int

The date and time that the executor was terminated.
