=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::CapacityAssignmentConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::CapacityAssignmentConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CapacityAssignments => $value, ..., CapacityReservationName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::CapacityAssignmentConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CapacityAssignments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Assigns Athena workgroups (and hence their queries) to capacity
reservations. A capacity reservation can have only one capacity
assignment configuration, but the capacity assignment configuration can
be made up of multiple individual assignments. Each assignment
specifies how Athena queries can consume capacity from the capacity
reservation that their workgroup is mapped to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CapacityAssignments => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Athena::CapacityAssignment>]

The list of assignments that make up the capacity assignment
configuration.


=head2 CapacityReservationName => Str

The name of the reservation that the capacity assignment configuration
is for.
