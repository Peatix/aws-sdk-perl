=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ListDatabases - Arguments for method ListDatabases on L<Paws::Athena>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListDatabases on the
L<Amazon Athena|Paws::Athena> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListDatabases.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListDatabases.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $athena = Paws->service('Athena');
    my $ListDatabasesOutput = $athena->ListDatabases(
      CatalogName => 'MyCatalogNameString',
      MaxResults  => 1,                       # OPTIONAL
      NextToken   => 'MyToken',               # OPTIONAL
      WorkGroup   => 'MyWorkGroupName',       # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DatabaseList = $ListDatabasesOutput->DatabaseList;
    my $NextToken    = $ListDatabasesOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Athena::ListDatabasesOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/athena/ListDatabases>
