=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ListSessions - Arguments for method ListSessions on L<Paws::Athena>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListSessions on the
L<Amazon Athena|Paws::Athena> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListSessions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListSessions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $athena = Paws->service('Athena');
    my $ListSessionsResponse = $athena->ListSessions(
      WorkGroup   => 'MyWorkGroupName',
      MaxResults  => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      NextToken   => 'MySessionManagerToken',    # OPTIONAL
      StateFilter => 'CREATING',                 # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextToken = $ListSessionsResponse->NextToken;
    my $Sessions  = $ListSessionsResponse->Sessions;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Athena::ListSessionsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/athena/ListSessions>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxResults => Int

C<DEGRADED> - The session has no healthy coordinators.

C<FAILED> - Due to a failure, the session and its resources are no
longer running.

Valid values are: C<"CREATING">, C<"CREATED">, C<"IDLE">, C<"BUSY">, C<"TERMINATING">, C<"TERMINATED">, C<"DEGRADED">, C<"FAILED">
