=head1 NAME

Paws::Athena::ResultConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Athena::ResultConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AclConfiguration => $value, ..., OutputLocation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Athena::ResultConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AclConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The location in Amazon S3 where query and calculation results are
stored and the encryption option, if any, used for query and
calculation results. These are known as "client-side settings". If
workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses
the workgroup settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AclConfiguration => L<Paws::Athena::AclConfiguration>

Indicates that an Amazon S3 canned ACL should be set to control
ownership of stored query results. Currently the only supported canned
ACL is C<BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL>. This is a client-side setting. If
workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses
the ACL configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also
uses the location for storing query results specified in the workgroup.
For more information, see
WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup
Settings Override Client-Side Settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html).


=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::Athena::EncryptionConfiguration>

If query and calculation results are encrypted in Amazon S3, indicates
the encryption option used (for example, C<SSE_KMS> or C<CSE_KMS>) and
key information. This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings
override client-side settings, then the query uses the encryption
configuration that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the
location for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See
WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup
Settings Override Client-Side Settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html).


=head2 ExpectedBucketOwner => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID that you expect to be the owner of
the Amazon S3 bucket specified by ResultConfiguration$OutputLocation.
If set, Athena uses the value for C<ExpectedBucketOwner> when it makes
Amazon S3 calls to your specified output location. If the
C<ExpectedBucketOwner> Amazon Web Services account ID does not match
the actual owner of the Amazon S3 bucket, the call fails with a
permissions error.

This is a client-side setting. If workgroup settings override
client-side settings, then the query uses the C<ExpectedBucketOwner>
setting that is specified for the workgroup, and also uses the location
for storing query results specified in the workgroup. See
WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration and Workgroup
Settings Override Client-Side Settings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/workgroups-settings-override.html).


=head2 OutputLocation => Str

The location in Amazon S3 where your query and calculation results are
stored, such as C<s3://path/to/query/bucket/>. To run the query, you
must specify the query results location using one of the ways: either
for individual queries using either this setting (client-side), or in
the workgroup, using WorkGroupConfiguration. If none of them is set,
Athena issues an error that no output location is provided. If
workgroup settings override client-side settings, then the query uses
the settings specified for the workgroup. See
WorkGroupConfiguration$EnforceWorkGroupConfiguration.
