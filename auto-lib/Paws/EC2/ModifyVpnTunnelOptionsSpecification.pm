=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::ModifyVpnTunnelOptionsSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::ModifyVpnTunnelOptionsSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DPDTimeoutAction => $value, ..., TunnelInsideIpv6Cidr => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::ModifyVpnTunnelOptionsSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DPDTimeoutAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DPDTimeoutAction => Str

The action to take after DPD timeout occurs. Specify C<restart> to
restart the IKE initiation. Specify C<clear> to end the IKE session.

Valid Values: C<clear> | C<none> | C<restart>

Default: C<clear>


=head2 DPDTimeoutSeconds => Int

The number of seconds after which a DPD timeout occurs. A DPD timeout
of 40 seconds means that the VPN endpoint will consider the peer dead
30 seconds after the first failed keep-alive.

Constraints: A value greater than or equal to 30.

Default: C<40>


=head2 EnableTunnelLifecycleControl => Bool

Turn on or off tunnel endpoint lifecycle control feature.


=head2 IKEVersions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::IKEVersionsRequestListValue>]

The IKE versions that are permitted for the VPN tunnel.

Valid values: C<ikev1> | C<ikev2>


=head2 LogOptions => L<Paws::EC2::VpnTunnelLogOptionsSpecification>

Options for logging VPN tunnel activity.


=head2 Phase1DHGroupNumbers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase1DHGroupNumbersRequestListValue>]

One or more Diffie-Hellman group numbers that are permitted for the VPN
tunnel for phase 1 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<2> | C<14> | C<15> | C<16> | C<17> | C<18> | C<19> |
C<20> | C<21> | C<22> | C<23> | C<24>


=head2 Phase1EncryptionAlgorithms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase1EncryptionAlgorithmsRequestListValue>]

One or more encryption algorithms that are permitted for the VPN tunnel
for phase 1 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<AES128> | C<AES256> | C<AES128-GCM-16> |
C<AES256-GCM-16>


=head2 Phase1IntegrityAlgorithms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase1IntegrityAlgorithmsRequestListValue>]

One or more integrity algorithms that are permitted for the VPN tunnel
for phase 1 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<SHA1> | C<SHA2-256> | C<SHA2-384> | C<SHA2-512>


=head2 Phase1LifetimeSeconds => Int

The lifetime for phase 1 of the IKE negotiation, in seconds.

Constraints: A value between 900 and 28,800.

Default: C<28800>


=head2 Phase2DHGroupNumbers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase2DHGroupNumbersRequestListValue>]

One or more Diffie-Hellman group numbers that are permitted for the VPN
tunnel for phase 2 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<2> | C<5> | C<14> | C<15> | C<16> | C<17> | C<18> |
C<19> | C<20> | C<21> | C<22> | C<23> | C<24>


=head2 Phase2EncryptionAlgorithms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase2EncryptionAlgorithmsRequestListValue>]

One or more encryption algorithms that are permitted for the VPN tunnel
for phase 2 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<AES128> | C<AES256> | C<AES128-GCM-16> |
C<AES256-GCM-16>


=head2 Phase2IntegrityAlgorithms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::Phase2IntegrityAlgorithmsRequestListValue>]

One or more integrity algorithms that are permitted for the VPN tunnel
for phase 2 IKE negotiations.

Valid values: C<SHA1> | C<SHA2-256> | C<SHA2-384> | C<SHA2-512>


=head2 Phase2LifetimeSeconds => Int

The lifetime for phase 2 of the IKE negotiation, in seconds.

Constraints: A value between 900 and 3,600. The value must be less than
the value for C<Phase1LifetimeSeconds>.

Default: C<3600>


=head2 PreSharedKey => Str

The pre-shared key (PSK) to establish initial authentication between
the virtual private gateway and the customer gateway.

Constraints: Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods
(.), and underscores (_). Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length
and cannot start with zero (0).


=head2 RekeyFuzzPercentage => Int

The percentage of the rekey window (determined by
C<RekeyMarginTimeSeconds>) during which the rekey time is randomly
selected.

Constraints: A value between 0 and 100.

Default: C<100>


=head2 RekeyMarginTimeSeconds => Int

The margin time, in seconds, before the phase 2 lifetime expires,
during which the Amazon Web Services side of the VPN connection
performs an IKE rekey. The exact time of the rekey is randomly selected
based on the value for C<RekeyFuzzPercentage>.

Constraints: A value between 60 and half of C<Phase2LifetimeSeconds>.

Default: C<270>


=head2 ReplayWindowSize => Int
