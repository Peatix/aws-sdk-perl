=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachmentRequestOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachmentRequestOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplianceModeSupport => $value, ..., SecurityGroupReferencingSupport => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::CreateTransitGatewayVpcAttachmentRequestOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplianceModeSupport

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApplianceModeSupport => Str

Enable or disable support for appliance mode. If enabled, a traffic
flow between a source and destination uses the same Availability Zone
for the VPC attachment for the lifetime of that flow. The default is
C<disable>.


=head2 DnsSupport => Str

Enable or disable DNS support. The default is C<enable>.


=head2 Ipv6Support => Str

Enable or disable IPv6 support. The default is C<disable>.


=head2 SecurityGroupReferencingSupport => Str

Enables you to reference a security group across VPCs attached to a
transit gateway to simplify security group management.

This option is set to C<enable> by default. However, at the transit
gateway level the default is set to C<disable>.

For more information about security group referencing, see Security
group referencing
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html#vpc-attachment-security)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Transit Gateways Guide>.
