=head1 NAME

Paws::EC2::NetworkInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EC2::NetworkInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BandwidthWeightings => $value, ..., NetworkPerformance => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EC2::NetworkInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BandwidthWeightings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class has no description

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BandwidthWeightings => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of valid settings for configurable bandwidth weighting for the
instance type, if supported.


=head2 DefaultNetworkCardIndex => Int

The index of the default network card, starting at 0.


=head2 EfaInfo => L<Paws::EC2::EfaInfo>

Describes the Elastic Fabric Adapters for the instance type.


=head2 EfaSupported => Bool

Indicates whether Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is supported.


=head2 EnaSrdSupported => Bool

Indicates whether the instance type supports ENA Express. ENA Express
uses Amazon Web Services Scalable Reliable Datagram (SRD) technology to
increase the maximum bandwidth used per stream and minimize tail
latency of network traffic between EC2 instances.


=head2 EnaSupport => Str

Indicates whether Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) is supported.


=head2 EncryptionInTransitSupported => Bool

Indicates whether the instance type automatically encrypts in-transit
traffic between instances.


=head2 FlexibleEnaQueuesSupport => Str

Indicates whether changing the number of ENA queues is supported.


=head2 Ipv4AddressesPerInterface => Int

The maximum number of IPv4 addresses per network interface.


=head2 Ipv6AddressesPerInterface => Int

The maximum number of IPv6 addresses per network interface.


=head2 Ipv6Supported => Bool

Indicates whether IPv6 is supported.


=head2 MaximumNetworkCards => Int

The maximum number of physical network cards that can be allocated to
the instance.


=head2 MaximumNetworkInterfaces => Int

The maximum number of network interfaces for the instance type.


=head2 NetworkCards => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EC2::NetworkCardInfo>]

Describes the network cards for the instance type.


=head2 NetworkPerformance => Str

The network performance.
