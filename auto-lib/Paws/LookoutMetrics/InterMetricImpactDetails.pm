=head1 NAME

Paws::LookoutMetrics::InterMetricImpactDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::LookoutMetrics::InterMetricImpactDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnomalyGroupId => $value, ..., RelationshipType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::LookoutMetrics::InterMetricImpactDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnomalyGroupId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Aggregated details about the measures contributing to the anomaly
group, and the measures potentially impacted by the anomaly group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnomalyGroupId => Str

The ID of the anomaly group.


=head2 ContributionPercentage => Num

For potential causes (C<CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP>), the percentage
contribution the measure has in causing the anomalies.


=head2 MetricName => Str

The name of the measure.


=head2 RelationshipType => Str

Whether a measure is a potential cause of the anomaly group
(C<CAUSE_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP>), or whether the measure is impacted
by the anomaly group (C<EFFECT_OF_INPUT_ANOMALY_GROUP>).
