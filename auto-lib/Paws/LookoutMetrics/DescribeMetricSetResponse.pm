Paws::LookoutMetrics::DescribeMetricSetResponse

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnomalyDetectorArn => Str

The ARN of the detector that contains the dataset.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The time at which the dataset was created.


=head2 DimensionFilterList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutMetrics::MetricSetDimensionFilter>]

The dimensions and their values that were used to filter the dataset.


=head2 DimensionList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the dimensions chosen for analysis.


=head2 LastModificationTime => Str

The time at which the dataset was last modified.


=head2 MetricList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::LookoutMetrics::Metric>]

A list of the metrics defined by the dataset.


=head2 MetricSetArn => Str

The ARN of the dataset.


=head2 MetricSetDescription => Str

The dataset's description.


=head2 MetricSetFrequency => Str

The interval at which the data will be analyzed for anomalies.

Valid values are: C<"P1D">, C<"PT1H">, C<"PT10M">, C<"PT5M">
=head2 MetricSetName => Str

The name of the dataset.


=head2 MetricSource => L<Paws::LookoutMetrics::MetricSource>

Contains information about the dataset's source data.


=head2 Offset => Int

After an interval ends, the amount of seconds that the detector waits
before importing data. Offset is only supported for S3, Redshift,
Athena and datasources.


=head2 TimestampColumn => L<Paws::LookoutMetrics::TimestampColumn>

Contains information about the column used for tracking time in your
source data.


=head2 Timezone => Str
