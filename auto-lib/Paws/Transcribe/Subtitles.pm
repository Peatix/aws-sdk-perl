=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::Subtitles

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::Subtitles object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Formats => $value, ..., OutputStartIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::Subtitles object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Formats

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generate subtitles for your media file with your transcription request.

You can choose a start index of 0 or 1, and you can specify either
WebVTT or SubRip (or both) as your output format.

Note that your subtitle files are placed in the same location as your
transcription output.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Formats => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify the output format for your subtitle file; if you select both
WebVTT (C<vtt>) and SubRip (C<srt>) formats, two output files are
generated.


=head2 OutputStartIndex => Int

Specify the starting value that is assigned to the first subtitle
segment.

The default start index for Amazon Transcribe is C<0>, which differs
from the more widely used standard of C<1>. If you're uncertain which
value to use, we recommend choosing C<1>, as this may improve
compatibility with other services.
