=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::ChannelDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::ChannelDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelId => $value, ..., ParticipantRole => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::ChannelDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes it possible to specify which speaker is on which channel. For
example, if your agent is the first participant to speak, you would set
C<ChannelId> to C<0> (to indicate the first channel) and
C<ParticipantRole> to C<AGENT> (to indicate that it's the agent
speaking).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelId => Int

Specify the audio channel you want to define.


=head2 ParticipantRole => Str

Specify the speaker you want to define. Omitting this parameter is
equivalent to specifying both participants.
