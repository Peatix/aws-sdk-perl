=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::LanguageIdSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::LanguageIdSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LanguageModelName => $value, ..., VocabularyName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::LanguageIdSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LanguageModelName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If using automatic language identification in your request and you want
to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom
vocabulary filter, include C<LanguageIdSettings> with the relevant
sub-parameters (C<VocabularyName>, C<LanguageModelName>, and
C<VocabularyFilterName>). Note that multi-language identification
(C<IdentifyMultipleLanguages>) doesn't support custom language models.

C<LanguageIdSettings> supports two to five language codes. Each
language code you include can have an associated custom language model,
custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes
that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom
language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters.

It's recommended that you include C<LanguageOptions> when using
C<LanguageIdSettings> to ensure that the correct language dialect is
identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in
C<en-US> but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in
your media is C<en-AU>, your custom vocabulary I<is not> applied to
your transcription. If you include C<LanguageOptions> and include
C<en-US> as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary
I<is> applied to your transcription.

If you want to include a custom language model with your request but
B<do not> want to use automatic language identification, use instead
the C< parameter with the C<LanguageModelName> sub-parameter. If you
want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or
both) with your request but B<do not> want to use automatic language
identification, use instead the C< parameter with the C<VocabularyName>
or C<VocabularyFilterName> (or both) sub-parameter.>>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LanguageModelName => Str

The name of the custom language model you want to use when processing
your transcription job. Note that custom language model names are case
sensitive.

The language of the specified custom language model must match the
language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the
languages do not match, the custom language model isn't applied. There
are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to use when
processing your transcription job. Custom vocabulary filter names are
case sensitive.

The language of the specified custom vocabulary filter must match the
language code that you specify in your transcription request. If the
languages do not match, the custom vocabulary filter isn't applied.
There are no errors or warnings associated with a language mismatch.

Note that if you include C<VocabularyFilterName> in your request, you
must also include C<VocabularyFilterMethod>.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when processing your
transcription job. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

The language of the specified custom vocabulary must match the language
code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages
do not match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied. There are no errors
or warnings associated with a language mismatch.
