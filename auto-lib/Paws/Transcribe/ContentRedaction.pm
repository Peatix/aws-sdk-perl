Paws::Transcribe::ContentRedaction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::ContentRedaction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PiiEntityTypes => $value, ..., RedactionType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::ContentRedaction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PiiEntityTypes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes it possible to redact or flag specified personally identifiable
information (PII) in your transcript. If you use C<ContentRedaction>,
you must also include the sub-parameters: C<RedactionOutput> and
C<RedactionType>. You can optionally include C<PiiEntityTypes> to
choose which types of PII you want to redact.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PiiEntityTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify which types of personally identifiable information (PII) you
want to redact in your transcript. You can include as many types as
you'd like, or you can select C<ALL>. If you do not include
C<PiiEntityTypes> in your request, all PII is redacted.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RedactionOutput => Str

Specify if you want only a redacted transcript, or if you want a
redacted and an unredacted transcript.

When you choose C<redacted> Amazon Transcribe creates only a redacted
transcript.

When you choose C<redacted_and_unredacted> Amazon Transcribe creates a
redacted and an unredacted transcript (as two separate files).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RedactionType => Str

Specify the category of information you want to redact; C<PII>
(personally identifiable information) is the only valid value. You can
use C<PiiEntityTypes> to choose which types of PII you want to redact.
If you do not include C<PiiEntityTypes> in your request, all PII is
redacted.
