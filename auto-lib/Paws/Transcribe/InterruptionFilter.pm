=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::InterruptionFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::InterruptionFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AbsoluteTimeRange => $value, ..., Threshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::InterruptionFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AbsoluteTimeRange

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Flag the presence or absence of interruptions in your Call Analytics
transcription output.

Rules using C<InterruptionFilter> are designed to match:

=over

=item *

Instances where an agent interrupts a customer

=item *

Instances where a customer interrupts an agent

=item *

Either participant interrupting the other

=item *

A lack of interruptions

=back

See Rule criteria for post-call categories
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tca-categories-batch.html#tca-rules-batch)
for usage examples.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AbsoluteTimeRange => L<Paws::Transcribe::AbsoluteTimeRange>

Makes it possible to specify a time range (in milliseconds) in your
audio, during which you want to search for an interruption. See for
more detail.


=head2 Negate => Bool

Set to C<TRUE> to flag speech that does not contain interruptions. Set
to C<FALSE> to flag speech that contains interruptions.


=head2 ParticipantRole => Str

Specify the interrupter that you want to flag. Omitting this parameter
is equivalent to specifying both participants.


=head2 RelativeTimeRange => L<Paws::Transcribe::RelativeTimeRange>

Makes it possible to specify a time range (in percentage) in your media
file, during which you want to search for an interruption. See for more
detail.


=head2 Threshold => Int

Specify the duration of the interruptions in milliseconds. For example,
you can flag speech that contains more than 10,000 milliseconds of
interruptions.
