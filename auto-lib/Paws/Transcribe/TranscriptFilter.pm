=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AbsoluteTimeRange => $value, ..., TranscriptFilterType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AbsoluteTimeRange

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Flag the presence or absence of specific words or phrases detected in
your Call Analytics transcription output.

Rules using C<TranscriptFilter> are designed to match:

=over

=item *

Custom words or phrases spoken by the agent, the customer, or both

Custom words or phrases B<not> spoken by the agent, the customer, or
either

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AbsoluteTimeRange => L<Paws::Transcribe::AbsoluteTimeRange>

Makes it possible to specify a time range (in milliseconds) in your
audio, during which you want to search for the specified key words or
phrases. See for more detail.


=head2 Negate => Bool

Set to C<TRUE> to flag the absence of the phrase that you specified in
your request. Set to C<FALSE> to flag the presence of the phrase that
you specified in your request.


=head2 ParticipantRole => Str

Specify the participant that you want to flag. Omitting this parameter
is equivalent to specifying both participants.


=head2 RelativeTimeRange => L<Paws::Transcribe::RelativeTimeRange>

Makes it possible to specify a time range (in percentage) in your media
file, during which you want to search for the specified key words or
phrases. See for more detail.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Targets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify the phrases that you want to flag.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TranscriptFilterType => Str

Flag the presence or absence of an exact match to the phrases that you
specify. For example, if you specify the phrase "speak to a manager" as
your C<Targets> value, only that exact phrase is flagged.

Note that semantic matching is not supported. For example, if your
customer says "speak to I<the> manager", instead of "speak to I<a>
manager", your content is not flagged.
