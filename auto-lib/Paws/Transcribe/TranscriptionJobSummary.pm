=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJobSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJobSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompletionTime => $value, ..., TranscriptionJobStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJobSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompletionTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides detailed information about a specific transcription job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompletionTime => Str

The date and time the specified transcription job finished processing.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:33:13.922000-07:00> represents a transcription
job that started processing at 12:33 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.


=head2 ContentRedaction => L<Paws::Transcribe::ContentRedaction>

The content redaction settings of the transcription job.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The date and time the specified transcription job request was made.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00> represents a transcription
job that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If C<TranscriptionJobStatus> is C<FAILED>, C<FailureReason> contains
information about why the transcription job failed. See also: Common
Errors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).


=head2 IdentifiedLanguageScore => Num

The confidence score associated with the language identified in your
media file.

Confidence scores are values between 0 and 1; a larger value indicates
a higher probability that the identified language correctly matches the
language spoken in your media.


=head2 IdentifyLanguage => Bool

Indicates whether automatic language identification was enabled
(C<TRUE>) for the specified transcription job.


=head2 IdentifyMultipleLanguages => Bool

Indicates whether automatic multi-language identification was enabled
(C<TRUE>) for the specified transcription job.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code used to create your transcription.


=head2 LanguageCodes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transcribe::LanguageCodeItem>]

The language codes used to create your transcription job. This
parameter is used with multi-language identification. For
single-language identification, the singular version of this parameter,
C<LanguageCode>, is present.


=head2 ModelSettings => L<Paws::Transcribe::ModelSettings>




=head2 OutputLocationType => Str

Indicates where the specified transcription output is stored.

If the value is C<CUSTOMER_BUCKET>, the location is the Amazon S3
bucket you specified using the C<OutputBucketName> parameter in your
request. If you also included C<OutputKey> in your request, your output
is located in the path you specified in your request.

If the value is C<SERVICE_BUCKET>, the location is a service-managed
Amazon S3 bucket. To access a transcript stored in a service-managed
bucket, use the URI shown in the C<TranscriptFileUri> or
C<RedactedTranscriptFileUri> field.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The date and time your transcription job began processing.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.789000-07:00> represents a transcription
job that started processing at 12:32 PM UTC-7 on May 4, 2022.


=head2 ToxicityDetection => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transcribe::ToxicityDetectionSettings>]

Indicates whether toxicity detection was enabled for the specified
transcription job.


=head2 TranscriptionJobName => Str

The name of the transcription job. Job names are case sensitive and
must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 TranscriptionJobStatus => Str

Provides the status of your transcription job.

If the status is C<COMPLETED>, the job is finished and you can find the
results at the location specified in C<TranscriptFileUri> (or
C<RedactedTranscriptFileUri>, if you requested transcript redaction).
If the status is C<FAILED>, C<FailureReason> provides details on why
your transcription job failed.
