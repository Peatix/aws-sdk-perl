=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::LanguageModel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::LanguageModel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseModelName => $value, ..., UpgradeAvailability => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::LanguageModel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseModelName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=item *

The location of the files used to train the model

=item *

When the model was last modified

=item *

The name you chose for the model

=item *

The model's language

=item *

The model's processing state

=item *

Any available upgrades for the base model

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaseModelName => Str

The Amazon Transcribe standard language model, or base model, used to
create your custom language model.


=head2 CreateTime => Str

The date and time the specified custom language model was created.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00> represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
on May 4, 2022.


=head2 FailureReason => Str

If C<ModelStatus> is C<FAILED>, C<FailureReason> contains information
about why the custom language model request failed. See also: Common
Errors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html).


=head2 InputDataConfig => L<Paws::Transcribe::InputDataConfig>

The Amazon S3 location of the input files used to train and tune your
custom language model, in addition to the data access role ARN (Amazon
Resource Name) that has permissions to access these data.


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code used to create your custom language model. Each
custom language model must contain terms in only one language, and the
language you select for your custom language model must match the
language of your training and tuning data.

For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes,
refer to the Supported languages
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html)
table. Note that US English (C<en-US>) is the only language supported
with Amazon Transcribe Medical.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time the specified custom language model was last
modified.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00> represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
on May 4, 2022.


=head2 ModelName => Str

A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom language model.

This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique
within an Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 ModelStatus => Str

The status of the specified custom language model. When the status
displays as C<COMPLETED> the model is ready for use.


=head2 UpgradeAvailability => Bool

Shows if a more current base model is available for use with the
specified custom language model.

If C<false>, your custom language model is using the most up-to-date
base model.

If C<true>, there is a newer base model available than the one your
language model is using.

Note that to update a base model, you must recreate the custom language
model using the new base model. Base model upgrades for existing custom
language models are not supported.
