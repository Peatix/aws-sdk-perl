=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RedactedTranscriptFileUri => $value, ..., TranscriptFileUri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::Transcript object:

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides you with the Amazon S3 URI you can use to access your
transcript.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RedactedTranscriptFileUri => Str

The Amazon S3 location of your redacted transcript. You can use this
URI to access or download your transcript.

If you included C<OutputBucketName> in your transcription job request,
this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included C<OutputKey> in
your request, your output is located in the path you specified in your
request.

If you didn't include C<OutputBucketName> in your transcription job
request, your transcript is stored in a service-managed bucket, and
C<RedactedTranscriptFileUri> provides you with a temporary URI you can
use for secure access to your transcript.

Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are only valid for
15 minutes. If you get an C<AccesDenied> error, you can get a new
temporary URI by running a C<GetTranscriptionJob> or
C<ListTranscriptionJob> request.
