Provides information about a custom vocabulary filter, including the
language of the filter, when it was last modified, and its name.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code that represents the language of the entries in your
vocabulary filter. Each custom vocabulary filter must contain terms in
only one language.

A custom vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in the
same language as the filter. For example, if you create a custom
vocabulary filter using US English (C<en-US>), you can only apply this
filter to files that contain English audio.

For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes,
refer to the Supported languages
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html)
table.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time the specified custom vocabulary filter was last
modified.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00> represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
on May 4, 2022.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom vocabulary filter. This
name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique
within an Amazon Web Services account.
