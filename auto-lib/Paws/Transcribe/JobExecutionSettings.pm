=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::JobExecutionSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::JobExecutionSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowDeferredExecution => $value, ..., DataAccessRoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::JobExecutionSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowDeferredExecution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes it possible to control how your transcription job is processed.
Currently, the only C<JobExecutionSettings> modification you can choose
is enabling job queueing using the C<AllowDeferredExecution>
sub-parameter.

If you include C<JobExecutionSettings> in your request, you must also
include the sub-parameters: C<AllowDeferredExecution> and
C<DataAccessRoleArn>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowDeferredExecution => Bool

Makes it possible to enable job queuing when your concurrent request
limit is exceeded. When C<AllowDeferredExecution> is set to C<true>,
transcription job requests are placed in a queue until the number of
jobs falls below the concurrent request limit. If
C<AllowDeferredExecution> is set to C<false> and the number of
transcription job requests exceed the concurrent request limit, you get
a C<LimitExceededException> error.

If you include C<AllowDeferredExecution> in your request, you must also
include C<DataAccessRoleArn>.


=head2 DataAccessRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to
access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files. If the role
that you specify doesnE<rsquo>t have the appropriate permissions to
access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

IAM role ARNs have the format
C<arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path>. For example:
C<arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin>. For more information, see IAM
ARNs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns).

Note that if you include C<DataAccessRoleArn> in your request, you must
also include C<AllowDeferredExecution>.
