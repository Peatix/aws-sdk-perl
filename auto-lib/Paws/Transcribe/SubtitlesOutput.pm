=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::SubtitlesOutput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::SubtitlesOutput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Formats => $value, ..., SubtitleFileUris => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::SubtitlesOutput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Formats

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about your subtitle file, including format, start
index, and Amazon S3 location.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Formats => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Provides the format of your subtitle files. If your request included
both WebVTT (C<vtt>) and SubRip (C<srt>) formats, both formats are
shown.


=head2 OutputStartIndex => Int

Provides the start index value for your subtitle files. If you did not
specify a value in your request, the default value of C<0> is used.


=head2 SubtitleFileUris => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon S3 location of your transcript. You can use this URI to
access or download your subtitle file. Your subtitle file is stored in
the same location as your transcript. If you specified both WebVTT and
SubRip subtitle formats, two URIs are provided.

If you included C<OutputBucketName> in your transcription job request,
this is the URI of that bucket. If you also included C<OutputKey> in
your request, your output is located in the path you specified in your
request.

If you didn't include C<OutputBucketName> in your transcription job
request, your subtitle file is stored in a service-managed bucket, and
C<TranscriptFileUri> provides you with a temporary URI you can use for
secure access to your subtitle file.

Temporary URIs for service-managed Amazon S3 buckets are only valid for
15 minutes. If you get an C<AccesDenied> error, you can get a new
temporary URI by running a C<GetTranscriptionJob> or
C<ListTranscriptionJob> request.
