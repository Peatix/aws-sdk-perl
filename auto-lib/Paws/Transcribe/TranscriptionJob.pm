=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJob

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJob object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompletionTime => $value, ..., TranscriptionJobStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::TranscriptionJob object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompletionTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides detailed information about a transcription job.

To view the status of the specified transcription job, check the
C<TranscriptionJobStatus> field. If the status is C<COMPLETED>, the job
is finished and you can find the results at the location specified in
C<TranscriptFileUri>. If the status is C<FAILED>, C<FailureReason>
provides details on why your transcription job failed.

If you enabled content redaction, the redacted transcript can be found
at the location specified in C<RedactedTranscriptFileUri>.
