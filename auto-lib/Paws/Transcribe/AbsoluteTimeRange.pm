=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::AbsoluteTimeRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::AbsoluteTimeRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndTime => $value, ..., StartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::AbsoluteTimeRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A time range, in milliseconds, between two points in your media file.

You can use C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> to search a custom segment. For
example, setting C<StartTime> to 10000 and C<EndTime> to 50000 only
searches for your specified criteria in the audio contained between the
10,000 millisecond mark and the 50,000 millisecond mark of your media
file. You must use C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> as a set; that is, if
you include one, you must include both.

You can use also C<First> to search from the start of the audio until
the time that you specify, or C<Last> to search from the time that you
specify until the end of the audio. For example, setting C<First> to
50000 only searches for your specified criteria in the audio contained
between the start of the media file to the 50,000 millisecond mark. You
can use C<First> and C<Last> independently of each other.

If you prefer to use percentage instead of milliseconds, see .

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndTime => Int

The time, in milliseconds, when Amazon Transcribe stops searching for
the specified criteria in your audio. If you include C<EndTime> in your
request, you must also include C<StartTime>.


=head2 First => Int

The time, in milliseconds, from the start of your media file until the
specified value. Amazon Transcribe searches for your specified criteria
in this time segment.


=head2 Last => Int

The time, in milliseconds, from the specified value until the end of
your media file. Amazon Transcribe searches for your specified criteria
in this time segment.


=head2 StartTime => Int

The time, in milliseconds, when Amazon Transcribe starts searching for
the specified criteria in your audio. If you include C<StartTime> in
your request, you must also include C<EndTime>.
