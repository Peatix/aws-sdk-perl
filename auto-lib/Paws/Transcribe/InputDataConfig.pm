=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::InputDataConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::InputDataConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataAccessRoleArn => $value, ..., TuningDataS3Uri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::InputDataConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataAccessRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the Amazon S3 location of the training data you want to use to
create a new custom language model, and permissions to access this
location.

When using C<InputDataConfig>, you must include these sub-parameters:
C<S3Uri> and C<DataAccessRoleArn>. You can optionally include
C<TuningDataS3Uri>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataAccessRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to
access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files. If the role
that you specify doesnE<rsquo>t have the appropriate permissions to
access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails.

IAM role ARNs have the format
C<arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path>. For example:
C<arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin>.

For more information, see IAM ARNs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-arns).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files you want to use to train
your custom language model.

Here's an example URI path:
C<s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-model-training-data/>


=head2 TuningDataS3Uri => Str

The Amazon S3 location (URI) of the text files you want to use to tune
your custom language model.

Here's an example URI path:
C<s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-model-tuning-data/>
