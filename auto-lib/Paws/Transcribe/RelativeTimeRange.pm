=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::RelativeTimeRange

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::RelativeTimeRange object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndPercentage => $value, ..., StartPercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::RelativeTimeRange object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndPercentage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A time range, in percentage, between two points in your media file.

You can use C<StartPercentage> and C<EndPercentage> to search a custom
segment. For example, setting C<StartPercentage> to 10 and
C<EndPercentage> to 50 only searches for your specified criteria in the
audio contained between the 10 percent mark and the 50 percent mark of
your media file.

You can use also C<First> to search from the start of the media file
until the time that you specify. Or use C<Last> to search from the time
that you specify until the end of the media file. For example, setting
C<First> to 10 only searches for your specified criteria in the audio
contained in the first 10 percent of the media file.

If you prefer to use milliseconds instead of percentage, see .

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

specified value. Amazon Transcribe searches for your specified criteria
in this time segment.

media file. Amazon Transcribe searches for your specified criteria in
this time segment.


=head2 StartPercentage => Int
