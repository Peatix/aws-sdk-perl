=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::MedicalScribeSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::MedicalScribeSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelIdentification => $value, ..., VocabularyName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::MedicalScribeSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelIdentification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Makes it possible to control how your Medical Scribe job is processed
using a C<MedicalScribeSettings> object. Specify
C<ChannelIdentification> if C<ChannelDefinitions> are set. Enabled
C<ShowSpeakerLabels> if C<ChannelIdentification> and
C<ChannelDefinitions> are not set. One and only one of
C<ChannelIdentification> and C<ShowSpeakerLabels> must be set. If
C<ShowSpeakerLabels> is set, C<MaxSpeakerLabels> must also be set. Use
C<Settings> to specify a vocabulary or vocabulary filter or both using
C<VocabularyName>, C<VocabularyFilterName>. C<VocabularyFilterMethod>
must be specified if C<VocabularyFilterName> is set.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelIdentification => Bool

Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel
independently, then appends the output for each channel into one
transcript.

For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/channel-id.html).


=head2 ClinicalNoteGenerationSettings => L<Paws::Transcribe::ClinicalNoteGenerationSettings>

Specify settings for the clinical note generation.


=head2 MaxSpeakerLabels => Int

Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to partition in your
media.

Note that if your media contains more speakers than the specified
number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

If you specify the C<MaxSpeakerLabels> field, you must set the
C<ShowSpeakerLabels> field to true.


=head2 ShowSpeakerLabels => Bool

Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your Medical Scribe
output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from individual speakers
in your media file.

If you enable C<ShowSpeakerLabels> in your request, you must also
include C<MaxSpeakerLabels>.

For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html).


=head2 VocabularyFilterMethod => Str

Specify how you want your custom vocabulary filter applied to your
transcript.

To replace words with C<***>, choose C<mask>.

To delete words, choose C<remove>.

To flag words without changing them, choose C<tag>.


=head2 VocabularyFilterName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary filter you want to include in your
Medical Scribe request. Custom vocabulary filter names are case
sensitive.

Note that if you include C<VocabularyFilterName> in your request, you
must also include C<VocabularyFilterMethod>.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary you want to include in your Medical
Scribe request. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.
