=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::Tag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::Tag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::Tag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Adds metadata, in the form of a key:value pair, to the specified
resource.

For example, you could add the tag C<Department:Sales> to a resource to
indicate that it pertains to your organization's sales department. You
can also use tags for tag-based access control.

To learn more about tagging, see Tagging resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/tagging.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a
given resource. For example, in the tag C<Department:Sales>, the key is
'Department'.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Str

The second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associated with a
given resource. For example, in the tag C<Department:Sales>, the value
is 'Sales'.

Note that you can set the value of a tag to an empty string, but you
can't set the value of a tag to null. Omitting the tag value is the
same as using an empty string.
