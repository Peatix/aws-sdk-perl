=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about a custom vocabulary, including the language
of the custom vocabulary, when it was last modified, its name, and the
processing state.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LanguageCode => Str

The language code used to create your custom vocabulary. Each custom
vocabulary must contain terms in only one language.

A custom vocabulary can only be used to transcribe files in the same
language as the custom vocabulary. For example, if you create a custom
vocabulary using US English (C<en-US>), you can only apply this custom
vocabulary to files that contain English audio.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time the specified custom vocabulary was last modified.

Timestamps are in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS-UTC>. For
example, C<2022-05-04T12:32:58.761000-07:00> represents 12:32 PM UTC-7
on May 4, 2022.


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

A unique name, chosen by you, for your custom vocabulary. This name is
case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an
Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 VocabularyState => Str

The processing state of your custom vocabulary. If the state is
C<READY>, you can use the custom vocabulary in a
C<StartTranscriptionJob> request.
