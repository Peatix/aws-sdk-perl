=head1 NAME

Paws::Transcribe::MedicalTranscriptionSetting

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transcribe::MedicalTranscriptionSetting object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelIdentification => $value, ..., VocabularyName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transcribe::MedicalTranscriptionSetting object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelIdentification

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows additional optional settings in your request, including channel
identification, alternative transcriptions, and speaker partitioning.
You can use that to apply custom vocabularies to your medical
transcription job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelIdentification => Bool

Enables channel identification in multi-channel audio.

Channel identification transcribes the audio on each channel
independently, then appends the output for each channel into one
transcript.

If you have multi-channel audio and do not enable channel
identification, your audio is transcribed in a continuous manner and
your transcript does not separate the speech by channel.

For more information, see Transcribing multi-channel audio
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/channel-id.html).


=head2 MaxAlternatives => Int

Indicate the maximum number of alternative transcriptions you want
Amazon Transcribe Medical to include in your transcript.

If you select a number greater than the number of alternative
transcriptions generated by Amazon Transcribe Medical, only the actual
number of alternative transcriptions are included.

If you include C<MaxAlternatives> in your request, you must also
include C<ShowAlternatives> with a value of C<true>.

For more information, see Alternative transcriptions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-alternatives.html).


=head2 MaxSpeakerLabels => Int

Specify the maximum number of speakers you want to partition in your
media.

Note that if your media contains more speakers than the specified
number, multiple speakers are treated as a single speaker.

If you specify the C<MaxSpeakerLabels> field, you must set the
C<ShowSpeakerLabels> field to true.


=head2 ShowAlternatives => Bool

To include alternative transcriptions within your transcription output,
include C<ShowAlternatives> in your transcription request.

If you include C<ShowAlternatives>, you must also include
C<MaxAlternatives>, which is the maximum number of alternative
transcriptions you want Amazon Transcribe Medical to generate.

For more information, see Alternative transcriptions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/how-alternatives.html).


=head2 ShowSpeakerLabels => Bool

Enables speaker partitioning (diarization) in your transcription
output. Speaker partitioning labels the speech from individual speakers
in your media file.

If you enable C<ShowSpeakerLabels> in your request, you must also
include C<MaxSpeakerLabels>.

For more information, see Partitioning speakers (diarization)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/diarization.html).


=head2 VocabularyName => Str

The name of the custom vocabulary you want to use when processing your
medical transcription job. Custom vocabulary names are case sensitive.

The language of the specified custom vocabulary must match the language
code that you specify in your transcription request. If the languages
do not match, the custom vocabulary isn't applied. There are no errors
or warnings associated with a language mismatch. US English (C<en-US>)
is the only valid language for Amazon Transcribe Medical.
