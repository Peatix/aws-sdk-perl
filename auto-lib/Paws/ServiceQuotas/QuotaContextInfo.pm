=head1 NAME

Paws::ServiceQuotas::QuotaContextInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ServiceQuotas::QuotaContextInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContextId => $value, ..., ContextScopeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ServiceQuotas::QuotaContextInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContextId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that describes the context for a resource-level quota. For
resource-level quotas, such as C<Instances per OpenSearch Service
Domain>, you can apply the quota value at the resource-level for each
OpenSearch Service Domain in your Amazon Web Services account. Together
the attributes of this structure help you understand how the quota is
implemented by Amazon Web Services and how you can manage it. For
quotas such as C<Amazon OpenSearch Service Domains> which can be
managed at the account-level for each Amazon Web Services Region, the
C<QuotaContext> field is absent. See the attribute descriptions below
to further understand how to use them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContextId => Str

Specifies the resource, or resources, to which the quota applies. The
value for this field is either an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or *. If
the value is an ARN, the quota value applies to that resource. If the
value is *, then the quota value applies to all resources listed in the
C<ContextScopeType> field. The quota value applies to all resources for
which you havenE<rsquo>t previously applied a quota value, and any new
resources you create in your Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 ContextScope => Str

Specifies the scope to which the quota value is applied. If the scope
is C<RESOURCE>, the quota value is applied to each resource in the
Amazon Web Services account. If the scope is C<ACCOUNT>, the quota
value is applied to the Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 ContextScopeType => Str

Specifies the resource type to which the quota can be applied.
