=head1 NAME

Paws::OAM::LogGroupConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::OAM::LogGroupConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filter => $value, ..., Filter => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::OAM::LogGroupConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the C<Filter> parameter which you can use to
specify which log groups are to share log events from this source
account to the monitoring account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Filter => Str

Use this field to specify which log groups are to share their log
events with the monitoring account. Use the term C<LogGroupName> and
one or more of the following operands. Use single quotation marks (')
around log group names. The matching of log group names is case
sensitive. Each filter has a limit of five conditional operands.
Conditional operands are C<AND> and C<OR>.

=over

=item *

C<=> and C<!=>

=item *

C<AND>

=item *

C<OR>

=item *

C<LIKE> and C<NOT LIKE>. These can be used only as prefix searches.
Include a C<%> at the end of the string that you want to search for and
include.

=item *

C<IN> and C<NOT IN>, using parentheses C<( )>

=back

Examples:

=over

=item *

C<LogGroupName IN ('This-Log-Group', 'Other-Log-Group')> includes only
the log groups with names C<This-Log-Group> and C<Other-Log-Group>.

=item *

C<LogGroupName NOT IN ('Private-Log-Group', 'Private-Log-Group-2')>
includes all log groups except the log groups with names
C<Private-Log-Group> and C<Private-Log-Group-2>.

=item *

C<LogGroupName LIKE 'aws/lambda/%' OR LogGroupName LIKE 'AWSLogs%'>
includes all log groups that have names that start with C<aws/lambda/>
or C<AWSLogs>.

=back

If you are updating a link that uses filters, you can specify C<*> as
the only value for the C<filter> parameter to delete the filter and
share all log groups with the monitoring account.
