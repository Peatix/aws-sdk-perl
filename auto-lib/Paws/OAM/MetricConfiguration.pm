=head1 NAME

Paws::OAM::MetricConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::OAM::MetricConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filter => $value, ..., Filter => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::OAM::MetricConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the C<Filter> parameter which you can use to
specify which metric namespaces are to be shared from this source
account to the monitoring account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Filter => Str

Use this field to specify which metrics are to be shared with the
monitoring account. Use the term C<Namespace> and one or more of the
following operands. Use single quotation marks (') around namespace
names. The matching of namespace names is case sensitive. Each filter
has a limit of five conditional operands. Conditional operands are
C<AND> and C<OR>.

=over

=item *

C<=> and C<!=>

=item *

C<AND>

=item *

C<OR>

=item *

C<LIKE> and C<NOT LIKE>. These can be used only as prefix searches.
Include a C<%> at the end of the string that you want to search for and
include.

=item *

C<IN> and C<NOT IN>, using parentheses C<( )>

=back

Examples:

=over

=item *

C<Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%'> includes only namespaces that don't start
with C<AWS/>, such as custom namespaces.

=item *

C<Namespace IN ('AWS/EC2', 'AWS/ELB', 'AWS/S3')> includes only the
metrics in the EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon S3 namespaces.

=item *

C<Namespace = 'AWS/EC2' OR Namespace NOT LIKE 'AWS/%'> includes only
the EC2 namespace and your custom namespaces.

=back

If you are updating a link that uses filters, you can specify C<*> as
the only value for the C<filter> parameter to delete the filter and
share all metric namespaces with the monitoring account.
