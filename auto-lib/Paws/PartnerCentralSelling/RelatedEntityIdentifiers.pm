Paws::PartnerCentralSelling::RelatedEntityIdentifiers

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PartnerCentralSelling::RelatedEntityIdentifiers object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwsMarketplaceOffers => $value, ..., Solutions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PartnerCentralSelling::RelatedEntityIdentifiers object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwsMarketplaceOffers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This field provides the associations' information for other entities
with the opportunity. These entities include identifiers for
C<AWSProducts>, C<Partner Solutions>, and C<AWSMarketplaceOffers>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AwsMarketplaceOffers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Takes one value per opportunity. Each value is an Amazon Resource Name
(ARN), in this format: C<"offers":
["arn:aws:aws-marketplace:us-east-1:999999999999:AWSMarketplace/Offer/offer-sampleOffer32"]>.

Use the ListEntities
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_ListEntities.html)
action in the Marketplace Catalog APIs for a list of offers in the
associated Marketplace seller account.


=head2 AwsProducts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Enables the association of specific Amazon Web Services products with
the C<Opportunity>. Partners can indicate the relevant Amazon Web
Services products for the C<Opportunity>'s solution and align with the
customer's needs. Returns multiple values separated by commas. For
example, C<"AWSProducts" : ["AmazonRedshift", "AWSAppFabric",
"AWSCleanRooms"]>.

Use the file with the list of Amazon Web Services products hosted on
GitHub: Amazon Web Services products
(https://github.com/aws-samples/partner-crm-integration-samples/blob/main/resources/aws_products.json).


=head2 Solutions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Enables partner solutions or offerings' association with an
opportunity. To associate a solution, provide the solution's unique
identifier, which you can obtain with the C<ListSolutions> operation.

If the specific solution identifier is not available, you can use the
value C<Other> and provide details about the solution in the
C<otherSolutionOffered> field. But when the opportunity reaches the
C<Committed> stage or beyond, the C<Other> value cannot be used, and a
valid solution identifier must be provided.

By associating the relevant solutions with the opportunity, you can
communicate the offerings that are being considered or implemented to
address the customer's business problem.
