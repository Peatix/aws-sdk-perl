=head1 DESCRIPTION

Engagement members are the participants in an Engagement, which is
likely a collaborative project or business opportunity within the AWS
partner network. Members can be different partner organizations or AWS
accounts that are working together on a specific engagement.

Each member is represented by their AWS Account ID, Company Name, and
associated details. Members have a status within the Engagement
(PENDING, ACCEPTED, REJECTED, or WITHDRAWN), indicating their current
state of participation. Only existing members of an Engagement can view
the list of other members. This implies a level of privacy and access
control within the Engagement structure.
