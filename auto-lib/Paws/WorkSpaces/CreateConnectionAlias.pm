=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::CreateConnectionAlias - Arguments for method CreateConnectionAlias on L<Paws::WorkSpaces>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateConnectionAlias on the
L<Amazon WorkSpaces|Paws::WorkSpaces> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateConnectionAlias.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateConnectionAlias.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $workspaces = Paws->service('WorkSpaces');
    my $CreateConnectionAliasResult = $workspaces->CreateConnectionAlias(
      ConnectionString => 'MyConnectionString',
      Tags             => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 127
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 255; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AliasId = $CreateConnectionAliasResult->AliasId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WorkSpaces::CreateConnectionAliasResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConnectionString => Str

A connection string in the form of a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN), such as C<www.example.com>.

After you create a connection string, it is always associated to your
Amazon Web Services account. You cannot recreate the same connection
string with a different account, even if you delete all instances of it
from the original account. The connection string is globally reserved
for your account.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WorkSpaces::Tag>]

The tags to associate with the connection alias.
