=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceCreationProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceCreationProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomSecurityGroupId => $value, ..., UserEnabledAsLocalAdministrator => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceCreationProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomSecurityGroupId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the default properties that are used for creating WorkSpaces.
For more information, see Update Directory Details for Your WorkSpaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/update-directory-details.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomSecurityGroupId => Str

=head2 DefaultOu => Str

The default organizational unit (OU) for your WorkSpaces directories.
This string must be the full Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

the form C<"OU=I<value>,DC=I<value>,DC=I<value>">, where I<value> is
any string of characters, and the number of domain components (DCs) is
two or more. For example,
C<OU=WorkSpaces_machines,DC=machines,DC=example,DC=com>.

=item *

To avoid errors, certain characters in the distinguished name must be
escaped. For more information, see Distinguished Names
(https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/ldap/distinguished-names)
in the Microsoft documentation.

=item *

The API doesn't validate whether the OU exists.
