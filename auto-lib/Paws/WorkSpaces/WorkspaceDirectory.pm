=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceDirectory

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceDirectory object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveDirectoryConfig => $value, ..., WorkspaceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceDirectory object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveDirectoryConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a directory that is used with Amazon WorkSpaces.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveDirectoryConfig => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::ActiveDirectoryConfig>

Information about the Active Directory config.


=head2 Alias => Str

The directory alias.


=head2 CertificateBasedAuthProperties => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::CertificateBasedAuthProperties>

The certificate-based authentication properties used to authenticate
SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities to Active Directory
for WorkSpaces login.


=head2 CustomerUserName => Str

The user name for the service account.


=head2 DirectoryId => Str

The directory identifier.


=head2 DirectoryName => Str

The name of the directory.


=head2 DirectoryType => Str

directory between Standard TLS and FIPS 140-2 validated mode.


=head2 ErrorMessage => Str

=head2 IamRoleId => Str

The identifier of the IAM role. This is the role that allows Amazon
WorkSpaces to make calls to other services, such as Amazon EC2, on your
behalf.


=head2 IDCConfig => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::IDCConfig>

Specifies details about identity center configurations.


=head2 IpGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifiers of the IP access control groups associated with the
directory.


=head2 MicrosoftEntraConfig => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::MicrosoftEntraConfig>

Specifies details about Microsoft Entra configurations.


=head2 RegistrationCode => Str

The registration code for the directory. This is the code that users
enter in their Amazon WorkSpaces client application to connect to the
directory.


=head2 SamlProperties => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::SamlProperties>

Describes the enablement status, user access URL, and relay state
parameter name that are used for configuring federation with an SAML
2.0 identity provider.


=head2 SelfservicePermissions => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::SelfservicePermissions>

The default self-service permissions for WorkSpaces in the directory.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the directory's registration with Amazon WorkSpaces. After
a directory is deregistered, the C<DEREGISTERED> state is returned very
briefly before the directory metadata is cleaned up, so this state is
rarely returned. To confirm that a directory is deregistered, check for
the directory ID by using DescribeWorkspaceDirectories
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaceDirectories.html).
If the directory ID isn't returned, then the directory has been
successfully deregistered.


=head2 StreamingProperties => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::StreamingProperties>

The streaming properties to configure.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The identifiers of the subnets used with the directory.


=head2 Tenancy => Str

Specifies whether the directory is dedicated or shared. To use Bring

more information, see Bring Your Own Windows Desktop Images
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/byol-windows-images.html).


=head2 UserIdentityType => Str

Indicates the identity type of the specifired user.


=head2 WorkspaceAccessProperties => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::WorkspaceAccessProperties>

The devices and operating systems that users can use to access
WorkSpaces.


=head2 WorkspaceCreationProperties => L<Paws::WorkSpaces::DefaultWorkspaceCreationProperties>

The default creation properties for all WorkSpaces in the directory.


=head2 WorkspaceDirectoryDescription => Str

The description of the WorkSpace directory


=head2 WorkspaceDirectoryName => Str

The name fo the WorkSpace directory.
