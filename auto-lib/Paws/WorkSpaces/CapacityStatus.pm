  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveUserSessions => $value, ..., DesiredUserSessions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::CapacityStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveUserSessions

ActualUserSessions = AvailableUserSessions + ActiveUserSessions


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AvailableUserSessions => Int

The number of user sessions currently available for streaming from your
