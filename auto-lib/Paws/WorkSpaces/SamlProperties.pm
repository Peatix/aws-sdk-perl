=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::SamlProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::SamlProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RelayStateParameterName => $value, ..., UserAccessUrl => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::SamlProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RelayStateParameterName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the enablement status, user access URL, and relay state
parameter name that are used for configuring federation with an SAML
2.0 identity provider.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RelayStateParameterName => Str

The relay state parameter name supported by the SAML 2.0 identity
provider (IdP). When the end user is redirected to the user access URL
from the WorkSpaces client application, this relay state parameter name
is appended as a query parameter to the URL along with the relay state
endpoint to return the user to the client application session.

To use SAML 2.0 authentication with WorkSpaces, the IdP must support
IdP-initiated deep linking for the relay state URL. Consult your IdP
documentation for more information.


=head2 Status => Str

Indicates the status of SAML 2.0 authentication. These statuses include
the following.

=over

=item *

If the setting is C<DISABLED>, end users will be directed to login with
their directory credentials.

=item *

If the setting is C<ENABLED>, end users will be directed to login via
the user access URL. Users attempting to connect to WorkSpaces from a
client application that does not support SAML 2.0 authentication will
not be able to connect.

=item *

If the setting is C<ENABLED_WITH_DIRECTORY_LOGIN_FALLBACK>, end users
will be directed to login via the user access URL on supported client
applications, but will not prevent clients that do not support SAML 2.0
authentication from connecting as if SAML 2.0 authentication was
disabled.

=back



=head2 UserAccessUrl => Str

The SAML 2.0 identity provider (IdP) user access URL is the URL a user
would navigate to in their web browser in order to federate from the
IdP and directly access the application, without any SAML 2.0 service
provider (SP) bindings.
