=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::TimeoutSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::TimeoutSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds => $value, ..., MaxUserDurationInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::TimeoutSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the timeout settings for a pool of WorkSpaces.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds => Int

Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that a streaming session
remains active after users disconnect. If users try to reconnect to the
streaming session after a disconnection or network interruption within
the time set, they are connected to their previous session. Otherwise,
they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance.


=head2 IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds => Int

The amount of time in seconds a connection will stay active while idle.


=head2 MaxUserDurationInSeconds => Int

Specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a streaming
session can remain active. If users are still connected to a streaming
instance five minutes before this limit is reached, they are prompted
to save any open documents before being disconnected. After this time
elapses, the instance is terminated and replaced by a new instance.
