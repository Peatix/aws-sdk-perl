=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpaces::PendingCreateStandbyWorkspacesRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpaces::PendingCreateStandbyWorkspacesRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DirectoryId => $value, ..., WorkspaceId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpaces::PendingCreateStandbyWorkspacesRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DirectoryId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the standby WorkSpace.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DirectoryId => Str

The identifier of the directory for the standby WorkSpace.


=head2 State => Str

The operational state of the standby WorkSpace.


=head2 UserName => Str

Describes the standby WorkSpace that was created.

Because this operation is asynchronous, the identifier returned is not
immediately available for use with other operations. For example, if
you call DescribeWorkspaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/api/API_DescribeWorkspaces.html)
before the WorkSpace is created, the information returned can be
incomplete.


=head2 WorkspaceId => Str

The identifier of the standby WorkSpace.
