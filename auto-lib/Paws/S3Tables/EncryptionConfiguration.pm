=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Tables::EncryptionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Tables::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyArn => $value, ..., SseAlgorithm => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Tables::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration specifying how data should be encrypted. This structure
defines the encryption algorithm and optional KMS key to be used for
server-side encryption.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use for encryption.
This field is required only when C<sseAlgorithm> is set to C<aws:kms>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SseAlgorithm => Str

The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are C<AES256>
for S3-managed encryption keys, or C<aws:kms> for Amazon Web Services
KMS-managed encryption keys. If you choose SSE-KMS encryption you must
grant the S3 Tables maintenance principal access to your KMS key. For
more information, see Permissions requirements for S3 Tables SSE-KMS
encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables-kms-permissions.html).
