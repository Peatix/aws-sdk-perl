=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RecoveryPointByResource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RecoveryPointByResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BackupSizeBytes => $value, ..., VaultType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RecoveryPointByResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BackupSizeBytes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains detailed information about a saved recovery point.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BackupSizeBytes => Int

The size, in bytes, of a backup.


=head2 BackupVaultName => Str

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults
are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create
them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time a recovery point is created, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreationDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 EncryptionKeyArn => Str

The server-side encryption key that is used to protect your backups;
for example,
C<arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.


=head2 IndexStatus => Str

This is the current status for the backup index associated with the
specified recovery point.

Statuses are: C<PENDING> | C<ACTIVE> | C<FAILED> | C<DELETING>

A recovery point with an index that has the status of C<ACTIVE> can be
included in a search.


=head2 IndexStatusMessage => Str

A string in the form of a detailed message explaining the status of a
backup index associated with the recovery point.


=head2 IsParent => Bool

This is a boolean value indicating this is a parent (composite)
recovery point.


=head2 ParentRecoveryPointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the parent (composite) recovery
point.


=head2 RecoveryPointArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a recovery
point; for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45>.


=head2 ResourceName => Str

The non-unique name of the resource that belongs to the specified
backup.


=head2 Status => Str

A status code specifying the state of the recovery point.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A message explaining the current status of the recovery point.


=head2 VaultType => Str

The type of vault in which the described recovery point is stored.
