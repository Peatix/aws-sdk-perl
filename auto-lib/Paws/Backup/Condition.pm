=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::Condition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::Condition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConditionKey => $value, ..., ConditionValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::Condition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConditionKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains an array of triplets made up of a condition type (such as
C<StringEquals>), a key, and a value. Used to filter resources using
their tags and assign them to a backup plan. Case sensitive.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionKey => Str

The key in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag C<Department:
Accounting>, C<Department> is the key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionType => Str

An operation applied to a key-value pair used to assign resources to
your backup plan. Condition only supports C<StringEquals>. For more
flexible assignment options, including C<StringLike> and the ability to
exclude resources from your backup plan, use C<Conditions> (with an "s"
on the end) for your C<BackupSelection>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_BackupSelection.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConditionValue => Str

The value in a key-value pair. For example, in the tag C<Department:
Accounting>, C<Accounting> is the value.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Backup>
