=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., SelectionWindowDays => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<RecoveryPointSelection> has five parameters (three required and two
optional). The values you specify determine which recovery point is
included in the restore test. You must indicate with C<Algorithm> if
you want the latest recovery point within your C<SelectionWindowDays>
or if you want a random recovery point, and you must indicate through
C<IncludeVaults> from which vaults the recovery points can be chosen.

C<Algorithm> (I<required>) Valid values: "C<LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW>" or
"C<RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW>".

C<Recovery point types> (I<required>) Valid values: "C<SNAPSHOT>"
and/or "C<CONTINUOUS>". Include C<SNAPSHOT> to restore only snapshot
recovery points; include C<CONTINUOUS> to restore continuous recovery
points (point in time restore / PITR); use both to restore either a
snapshot or a continuous recovery point. The recovery point will be
determined by the value for C<Algorithm>.

C<IncludeVaults> (I<required>). You must include one or more backup
vaults. Use the wildcard ["*"] or specific ARNs.

C<SelectionWindowDays> (I<optional>) Value must be an integer (in days)
from 1 to 365. If not included, the value defaults to C<30>.

C<ExcludeVaults> (I<optional>). You can choose to input one or more
specific backup vault ARNs to exclude those vaults' contents from
restore eligibility. Or, you can include a list of selectors. If this
parameter and its value are not included, it defaults to empty list.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Algorithm => Str

Acceptable values include "LATEST_WITHIN_WINDOW" or
"RANDOM_WITHIN_WINDOW"


=head2 ExcludeVaults => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Accepted values include specific ARNs or list of selectors. Defaults to
empty list if not listed.


=head2 IncludeVaults => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Accepted values include wildcard ["*"] or by specific ARNs or ARN
wilcard replacement
["arn:aws:backup:us-west-2:123456789012:backup-vault:asdf", ...]
["arn:aws:backup:*:*:backup-vault:asdf-*", ...]


=head2 RecoveryPointTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

These are the types of recovery points.

Include C<SNAPSHOT> to restore only snapshot recovery points; include
C<CONTINUOUS> to restore continuous recovery points (point in time
restore / PITR); use both to restore either a snapshot or a continuous
recovery point. The recovery point will be determined by the value for
C<Algorithm>.


=head2 SelectionWindowDays => Int

Accepted values are integers from 1 to 365.
