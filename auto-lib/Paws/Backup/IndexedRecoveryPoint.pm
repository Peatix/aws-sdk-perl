=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::IndexedRecoveryPoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::IndexedRecoveryPoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BackupCreationDate => $value, ..., SourceResourceArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::IndexedRecoveryPoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BackupCreationDate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a recovery point that has an associated backup index.

Only recovery points with a backup index can be included in a search.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BackupCreationDate => Str

The date and time that a backup was created, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreationDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 BackupVaultArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies the backup vault where the recovery
point index is stored.

For example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault>.


=head2 IamRoleArn => Str

This specifies the IAM role ARN used for this operation.

For example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access


=head2 IndexCreationDate => Str

The date and time that a backup index was created, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreationDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 IndexStatus => Str

This is the current status for the backup index associated with the
specified recovery point.

Statuses are: C<PENDING> | C<ACTIVE> | C<FAILED> | C<DELETING>

A recovery point with an index that has the status of C<ACTIVE> can be
included in a search.


=head2 IndexStatusMessage => Str

A string in the form of a detailed message explaining the status of a
backup index associated with the recovery point.


=head2 RecoveryPointArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies a recovery point; for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45>


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The resource type of the indexed recovery point.

=over

=item *

C<EBS> for Amazon Elastic Block Store

=item *

C<S3> for Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

=back



=head2 SourceResourceArn => Str
