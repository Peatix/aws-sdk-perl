=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingPlanForGet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingPlanForGet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., StartWindowHours => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingPlanForGet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains metadata about a restore testing plan.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The date and time that a restore testing plan was created, in Unix
format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of
C<CreationTime> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CreatorRequestId => Str

This identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
without the risk of running the operation twice. If the request
includes a C<CreatorRequestId> that matches an existing backup plan,
that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.'
characters.


=head2 LastExecutionTime => Str

The last time a restore test was run with the specified restore testing
plan. A date and time, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC). The value of C<LastExecutionDate> is accurate to milliseconds.
For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26,
2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 LastUpdateTime => Str

The date and time that the restore testing plan was updated. This
update is in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The
value of C<LastUpdateTime> is accurate to milliseconds. For example,
the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 2018
12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RecoveryPointSelection => L<Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingRecoveryPointSelection>

The specified criteria to assign a set of resources, such as recovery
point types or backup vaults.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RestoreTestingPlanArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a restore
testing plan.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RestoreTestingPlanName => Str

The restore testing plan name.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduleExpression => Str

A CRON expression in specified timezone when a restore testing plan is
executed.


=head2 ScheduleExpressionTimezone => Str

Optional. This is the timezone in which the schedule expression is set.
By default, ScheduleExpressions are in UTC. You can modify this to a
specified timezone.


=head2 StartWindowHours => Int

Defaults to 24 hours.

A value in hours after a restore test is scheduled before a job will be
canceled if it doesn't start successfully. This value is optional. If
this value is included, this parameter has a maximum value of 168 hours
(one week).
