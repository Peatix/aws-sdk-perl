This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::ProtectedResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LastBackupTime => $value, ..., ResourceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::ProtectedResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LastBackupTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains information about a backed-up resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LastBackupTime => Str

=head2 LastRecoveryPointArn => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the most recent recovery point.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The
format of the ARN depends on the resource type.


=head2 ResourceName => Str
