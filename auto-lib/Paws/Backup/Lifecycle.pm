=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::Lifecycle

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::Lifecycle object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteAfterDays => $value, ..., OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::Lifecycle object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteAfterDays

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the time period, in days, before a recovery point transitions
to cold storage or is deleted.

Backups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for
a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, on the console, the retention setting
must be 90 days greater than the transition to cold after days setting.
The transition to cold after days setting can't be changed after a
backup has been transitioned to cold.

Resource types that can transition to cold storage are listed in the
Feature availability by resource
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/backup-feature-availability.html#features-by-resource)
table. Backup ignores this expression for other resource types.

To remove the existing lifecycle and retention periods and keep your
recovery points indefinitely, specify -1 for
C<MoveToColdStorageAfterDays> and C<DeleteAfterDays>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteAfterDays => Int

The number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted.
This value must be at least 90 days after the number of days specified
in C<MoveToColdStorageAfterDays>.


=head2 MoveToColdStorageAfterDays => Int

The number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to
cold storage.


=head2 OptInToArchiveForSupportedResources => Bool

If the value is true, your backup plan transitions supported resources
to archive (cold) storage tier in accordance with your lifecycle
settings.
