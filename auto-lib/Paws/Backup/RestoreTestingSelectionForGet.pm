=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForGet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForGet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., ValidationWindowHours => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForGet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains metadata about a restore testing selection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The date and time that a restore testing selection was created, in Unix
format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of
C<CreationTime> is accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value
1516925490.087 represents Friday, January 26, 201812:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CreatorRequestId => Str

This identifies the request and allows failed requests to be retried
without the risk of running the operation twice. If the request
includes a C<CreatorRequestId> that matches an existing backup plan,
that plan is returned. This parameter is optional.

If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.'
characters.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IamRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup uses to
create the target resource; for
example:C<arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access>.


=head2 ProtectedResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

You can include specific ARNs, such as C<ProtectedResourceArns:
["arn:aws:...", "arn:aws:..."]> or you can include a wildcard:
C<ProtectedResourceArns: ["*"]>, but not both.


=head2 ProtectedResourceConditions => L<Paws::Backup::ProtectedResourceConditions>

In a resource testing selection, this parameter filters by specific
conditions such as C<StringEquals> or C<StringNotEquals>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProtectedResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource included in a resource testing
selection; for example, an Amazon EBS volume or an Amazon RDS database.


=head2 RestoreMetadataOverrides => L<Paws::Backup::SensitiveStringMap>

You can override certain restore metadata keys by including the
parameter C<RestoreMetadataOverrides> in the body of
C<RestoreTestingSelection>. Key values are not case sensitive.

See the complete list of restore testing inferred metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restore-testing-inferred-metadata.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RestoreTestingPlanName => Str

The RestoreTestingPlanName is a unique string that is the name of the
restore testing plan.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RestoreTestingSelectionName => Str

The unique name of the restore testing selection that belongs to the
related restore testing plan.


=head2 ValidationWindowHours => Int

This is amount of hours (1 to 168) available to run a validation script
on the data. The data will be deleted upon the completion of the
validation script or the end of the specified retention period,
whichever comes first.
