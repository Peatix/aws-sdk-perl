=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForUpdate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForUpdate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IamRoleArn => $value, ..., ValidationWindowHours => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForUpdate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IamRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains metadata about a restore testing selection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IamRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup uses to
create the target resource; for example:
C<arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access>.


=head2 ProtectedResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

You can include a list of specific ARNs, such as
C<ProtectedResourceArns: ["arn:aws:...", "arn:aws:..."]> or you can
include a wildcard: C<ProtectedResourceArns: ["*"]>, but not both.


=head2 ProtectedResourceConditions => L<Paws::Backup::ProtectedResourceConditions>

The conditions that you define for resources in your restore testing
plan using tags.


=head2 RestoreMetadataOverrides => L<Paws::Backup::SensitiveStringMap>

You can override certain restore metadata keys by including the
parameter C<RestoreMetadataOverrides> in the body of
C<RestoreTestingSelection>. Key values are not case sensitive.

See the complete list of restore testing inferred metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restore-testing-inferred-metadata.html).


=head2 ValidationWindowHours => Int

This value represents the time, in hours, data is retained after a
restore test so that optional validation can be completed.

Accepted value is an integer between 0 and 168 (the hourly equivalent
of seven days).
