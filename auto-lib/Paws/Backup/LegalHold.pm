=head1 DESCRIPTION

A legal hold is an administrative tool that helps prevent backups from
being deleted while under a hold. While the hold is in place, backups
under a hold cannot be deleted and lifecycle policies that would alter
the backup status (such as transition to cold storage) are delayed
until the legal hold is removed. A backup can have more than one legal
hold. Legal holds are applied to one or more backups (also known as
recovery points). These backups can be filtered by resource types and
by resource IDs.
