=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::CopyJob

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::CopyJob object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., StatusMessage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::CopyJob object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains detailed information about a copy job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The account ID that owns the copy job.


=head2 BackupSizeInBytes => Int

The size, in bytes, of a copy job.


=head2 ChildJobsInState => L<Paws::Backup::CopyJobChildJobsInState>

This returns the statistics of the included child (nested) copy jobs.


=head2 CompletionDate => Str

The date and time a copy job is completed, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CompletionDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CompositeMemberIdentifier => Str

The identifier of a resource within a composite group, such as nested
(child) recovery point belonging to a composite (parent) stack. The ID
is transferred from the logical ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html#resources-section-structure-syntax)
within a stack.


=head2 CopyJobId => Str

Uniquely identifies a copy job.


=head2 CreatedBy => L<Paws::Backup::RecoveryPointCreator>




=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time a copy job is created, in Unix format and Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreationDate> is accurate to
milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087 represents Friday,
January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 DestinationBackupVaultArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a destination
copy vault; for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault>.


=head2 DestinationRecoveryPointArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies a destination recovery point; for
example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45>.


=head2 IamRoleArn => Str

Specifies the IAM role ARN used to copy the target recovery point; for
example, C<arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access>.


=head2 IsParent => Bool

This is a boolean value indicating this is a parent (composite) copy
job.


=head2 MessageCategory => Str

This parameter is the job count for the specified message category.

Example strings may include C<AccessDenied>, C<SUCCESS>,
C<AGGREGATE_ALL>, and C<InvalidParameters>. See Monitoring
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/monitoring.html)
for a list of MessageCategory strings.

The the value ANY returns count of all message categories.

C<AGGREGATE_ALL> aggregates job counts for all message categories and
returns the sum


=head2 NumberOfChildJobs => Int

The number of child (nested) copy jobs.


=head2 ParentJobId => Str

This uniquely identifies a request to Backup to copy a resource. The
return will be the parent (composite) job ID.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Web Services resource to be copied; for example, an Amazon
Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational
Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.


=head2 ResourceName => Str

The non-unique name of the resource that belongs to the specified
backup.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource to be copied; for example, an
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume or an Amazon Relational
Database Service (Amazon RDS) database.


=head2 SourceBackupVaultArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a source copy
vault; for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault>.


=head2 SourceRecoveryPointArn => Str

An ARN that uniquely identifies a source recovery point; for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:recovery-point:1EB3B5E7-9EB0-435A-A80B-108B488B0D45>.


=head2 State => Str

The current state of a copy job.


=head2 StatusMessage => Str

A detailed message explaining the status of the job to copy a resource.
