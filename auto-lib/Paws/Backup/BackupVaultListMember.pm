=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::BackupVaultListMember

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::BackupVaultListMember object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BackupVaultArn => $value, ..., VaultType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::BackupVaultListMember object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BackupVaultArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains metadata about a backup vault.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BackupVaultArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a backup vault;
for example,
C<arn:aws:backup:us-east-1:123456789012:backup-vault:aBackupVault>.


=head2 BackupVaultName => Str

The name of a logical container where backups are stored. Backup vaults
are identified by names that are unique to the account used to create
them and the Amazon Web Services Region where they are created.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time a resource backup is created, in Unix format and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The value of C<CreationDate> is
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 CreatorRequestId => Str

A unique string that identifies the request and allows failed requests
to be retried without the risk of running the operation twice. This
parameter is optional.

If used, this parameter must contain 1 to 50 alphanumeric or '-_.'
characters.


=head2 EncryptionKeyArn => Str

A server-side encryption key you can specify to encrypt your backups
from services that support full Backup management; for example,
C<arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab>.
If you specify a key, you must specify its ARN, not its alias. If you
do not specify a key, Backup creates a KMS key for you by default.

To learn which Backup services support full Backup management and how
Backup handles encryption for backups from services that do not yet
support full Backup, see Encryption for backups in Backup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/encryption.html)


=head2 LockDate => Str

The date and time when Backup Vault Lock configuration becomes
immutable, meaning it cannot be changed or deleted.

If you applied Vault Lock to your vault without specifying a lock date,
you can change your Vault Lock settings, or delete Vault Lock from the
vault entirely, at any time.

This value is in Unix format, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and
accurate to milliseconds. For example, the value 1516925490.087
represents Friday, January 26, 2018 12:11:30.087 AM.


=head2 Locked => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether Backup Vault Lock applies to the
selected backup vault. If C<true>, Vault Lock prevents delete and
update operations on the recovery points in the selected vault.


=head2 MaxRetentionDays => Int

The Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the maximum retention
period that the vault retains its recovery points. If this parameter is
not specified, Vault Lock does not enforce a maximum retention period
on the recovery points in the vault (allowing indefinite storage).

If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle
policy with a retention period equal to or shorter than the maximum
retention period. If the job's retention period is longer than that
maximum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job,
and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different
vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock
are not affected.


=head2 MinRetentionDays => Int

The Backup Vault Lock setting that specifies the minimum retention
period that the vault retains its recovery points. If this parameter is
not specified, Vault Lock does not enforce a minimum retention period.

If specified, any backup or copy job to the vault must have a lifecycle
policy with a retention period equal to or longer than the minimum
retention period. If the job's retention period is shorter than that
minimum retention period, then the vault fails the backup or copy job,
and you should either modify your lifecycle settings or use a different
vault. Recovery points already stored in the vault prior to Vault Lock
are not affected.


=head2 NumberOfRecoveryPoints => Int

The number of recovery points that are stored in a backup vault.


=head2 VaultState => Str

The current state of the vault.


=head2 VaultType => Str

The type of vault in which the described recovery point is stored.
