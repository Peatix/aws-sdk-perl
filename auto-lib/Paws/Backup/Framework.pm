=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::Framework

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::Framework object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., NumberOfControls => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::Framework object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains detailed information about a framework. Frameworks contain
controls, which evaluate and report on your backup events and
resources. Frameworks generate daily compliance results.

C<CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS | DELETE_IN_PROGRESS |
COMPLETED | FAILED>


=head2 FrameworkArn => Str

An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a resource. The
format of the ARN depends on the resource type.


=head2 FrameworkDescription => Str

An optional description of the framework with a maximum 1,024
characters.


=head2 FrameworkName => Str
