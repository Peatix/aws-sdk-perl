=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForCreate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForCreate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IamRoleArn => $value, ..., ValidationWindowHours => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::RestoreTestingSelectionForCreate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IamRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains metadata about a specific restore testing selection.

ProtectedResourceType is required, such as Amazon EBS or Amazon EC2.

This consists of C<RestoreTestingSelectionName>,
C<ProtectedResourceType>, and one of the following:

=over

=item *

C<ProtectedResourceArns>

=item *

C<ProtectedResourceConditions>

=back

Each protected resource type can have one single value.

A restore testing selection can include a wildcard value ("*") for
C<ProtectedResourceArns> along with C<ProtectedResourceConditions>.
Alternatively, you can include up to 30 specific protected resource
ARNs in C<ProtectedResourceArns>.

C<ProtectedResourceConditions> examples include as C<StringEquals> and
C<StringNotEquals>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IamRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that Backup uses to
create the target resource; for example:
C<arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access>.


=head2 ProtectedResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Each protected resource can be filtered by its specific ARNs, such as
C<ProtectedResourceArns: ["arn:aws:...", "arn:aws:..."]> or by a
wildcard: C<ProtectedResourceArns: ["*"]>, but not both.


=head2 ProtectedResourceConditions => L<Paws::Backup::ProtectedResourceConditions>

If you have included the wildcard in ProtectedResourceArns, you can
include resource conditions, such as C<ProtectedResourceConditions: {
StringEquals: [{ key: "XXXX", value: "YYYY" }]>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ProtectedResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource included in a restore testing
selection; for example, an Amazon EBS volume or an Amazon RDS database.

=head2 RestoreMetadataOverrides => L<Paws::Backup::SensitiveStringMap>

You can override certain restore metadata keys by including the
parameter C<RestoreMetadataOverrides> in the body of
C<RestoreTestingSelection>. Key values are not case sensitive.

See the complete list of restore testing inferred metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/restore-testing-inferred-metadata.html).

The unique name of the restore testing selection that belongs to the
related restore testing plan.


=head2 ValidationWindowHours => Int

This is amount of hours (1 to 168) available to run a validation script
on the data. The data will be deleted upon the completion of the
validation script or the end of the specified retention period,
whichever comes first.
