=head1 NAME

Paws::Backup::BackupSelection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Backup::BackupSelection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Conditions => $value, ..., SelectionName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Backup::BackupSelection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Conditions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used to specify a set of resources to a backup plan.

We recommend that you specify conditions, tags, or resources to include
or exclude. Otherwise, Backup attempts to select all supported and
opted-in storage resources, which could have unintended cost
implications.

For more information, see Assigning resources programmatically
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/assigning-resources.html#assigning-resources-json).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Conditions => L<Paws::Backup::Conditions>

The conditions that you define to assign resources to your backup plans
using tags. For example, C<"StringEquals": { "ConditionKey":
"aws:ResourceTag/backup", "ConditionValue": "daily" }>.

C<Conditions> supports C<StringEquals>, C<StringLike>,
C<StringNotEquals>, and C<StringNotLike>. Condition operators are case
sensitive.

If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match all
conditions (AND logic).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IamRoleArn => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that Backup uses to authenticate when backing
up the target resource; for example,
C<arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access>.


=head2 ListOfTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Backup::Condition>]

The conditions that you define to assign resources to your backup plans
using tags. For example, C<"StringEquals": { "ConditionKey": "backup",
"ConditionValue": "daily"}>.

C<ListOfTags> supports only C<StringEquals>. Condition operators are
case sensitive.

If you specify multiple conditions, the resources much match any of the
conditions (OR logic).


=head2 NotResources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to exclude from a
backup plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30
ARNs with wildcards.

If you need to exclude many resources from a backup plan, consider a
different resource selection strategy, such as assigning only one or a
few resource types or refining your resource selection using tags.


=head2 Resources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources to assign to a backup
plan. The maximum number of ARNs is 500 without wildcards, or 30 ARNs
with wildcards.

If you need to assign many resources to a backup plan, consider a
different resource selection strategy, such as assigning all resources
of a resource type or refining your resource selection using tags.

If you specify multiple ARNs, the resources much match any of the ARNs
(OR logic).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SelectionName => Str

The display name of a resource selection document. Must contain 1 to 50
alphanumeric or '-_.' characters.
