=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategorySplitChargeRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategorySplitChargeRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Method => $value, ..., Targets => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategorySplitChargeRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Method

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use the split charge rule to split the cost of one Cost Category value
across several other target values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Method => Str

The method that's used to define how to split your source costs across
your targets.

C<Proportional> - Allocates charges across your targets based on the
proportional weighted cost of each target.

C<Fixed> - Allocates charges across your targets based on your defined
allocation percentage.

E<gt>C<Even> - Allocates costs evenly across all targets.


=head2 Parameters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategorySplitChargeRuleParameter>]

The parameters for a split charge method. This is only required for the
C<FIXED> method.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Source => Str

The Cost Category value that you want to split. That value can't be
used as a source or a target in other split charge rules. To indicate
uncategorized costs, you can use an empty string as the source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Targets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Cost Category values that you want to split costs across. These
values can't be used as a source in other split charge rules.
