=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::Anomaly

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostExplorer::Anomaly object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnomalyEndDate => $value, ..., RootCauses => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostExplorer::Anomaly object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnomalyEndDate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An unusual cost pattern. This consists of the detailed metadata and the
current status of the anomaly object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<REQUIRED> AnomalyId => Str

The unique identifier for the anomaly.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AnomalyScore => L<Paws::CostExplorer::AnomalyScore>

The latest and maximum score for the anomaly.


=head2 AnomalyStartDate => Str

The first day the anomaly is detected.


=head2 DimensionValue => Str
