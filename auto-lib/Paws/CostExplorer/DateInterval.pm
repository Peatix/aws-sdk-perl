=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::DateInterval

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostExplorer::DateInterval object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { End => $value, ..., Start => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostExplorer::DateInterval object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->End

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The time period of the request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> End => Str

The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For example, if
C<end> is C<2017-05-01>, Amazon Web Services retrieves cost and usage
data from the start date up to, but not including, C<2017-05-01>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Start => Str

The beginning of the time period. The start date is inclusive. For
example, if C<start> is C<2017-01-01>, Amazon Web Services retrieves
cost and usage data starting at C<2017-01-01> up to the end date. The
start date must be equal to or no later than the current date to avoid
a validation error.
