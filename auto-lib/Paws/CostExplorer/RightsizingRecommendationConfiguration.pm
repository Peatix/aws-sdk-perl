=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::RightsizingRecommendationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostExplorer::RightsizingRecommendationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BenefitsConsidered => $value, ..., RecommendationTarget => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostExplorer::RightsizingRecommendationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BenefitsConsidered

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can use C<RightsizingRecommendationConfiguration> to customize
recommendations across two attributes. You can choose to view
recommendations for instances within the same instance families or
across different instance families. You can also choose to view your
estimated savings that are associated with recommendations with
consideration of existing Savings Plans or Reserved Instance (RI)
benefits, or neither.

recommendations for instances across other families. The default value
