=head1 NAME

Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DimensionKey => $value, ..., DimensionName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CostExplorer::CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DimensionKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When you create or update a cost category, you can define the
C<CostCategoryRule> rule type as C<INHERITED_VALUE>. This rule type
adds the flexibility to define a rule that dynamically inherits the
cost category value from the dimension value that's defined by
C<CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension>. For example, suppose that you
want to dynamically group costs that are based on the value of a
specific tag key. First, choose an inherited value rule type, and then
choose the tag dimension and specify the tag key to use.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DimensionKey => Str

The key to extract cost category values.


=head2 DimensionName => Str

The name of the dimension that's used to group costs.

If you specify C<LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME>, the cost category value is based
on account name. If you specify C<TAG>, the cost category value is
based on the value of the specified tag key.
