=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::LoggingConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lambda::LoggingConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplicationLogLevel => $value, ..., SystemLogLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lambda::LoggingConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplicationLogLevel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The function's Amazon CloudWatch Logs configuration settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApplicationLogLevel => Str

Set this property to filter the application logs for your function that
Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends application logs at the
selected level of detail and lower, where C<TRACE> is the highest level
and C<FATAL> is the lowest.


=head2 LogFormat => Str

The format in which Lambda sends your function's application and system
logs to CloudWatch. Select between plain text and structured JSON.


=head2 LogGroup => Str

The name of the Amazon CloudWatch log group the function sends logs to.
By default, Lambda functions send logs to a default log group named
C</aws/lambda/E<lt>function nameE<gt>>. To use a different log group,
enter an existing log group or enter a new log group name.


=head2 SystemLogLevel => Str

Set this property to filter the system logs for your function that
Lambda sends to CloudWatch. Lambda only sends system logs at the
selected level of detail and lower, where C<DEBUG> is the highest level
and C<WARN> is the lowest.
