=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::Cors

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lambda::Cors object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowCredentials => $value, ..., MaxAge => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lambda::Cors object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowCredentials

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) settings for
your Lambda function URL. Use CORS to grant access to your function URL
from any origin. You can also use CORS to control access for specific
HTTP headers and methods in requests to your function URL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowCredentials => Bool

Whether to allow cookies or other credentials in requests to your
function URL. The default is C<false>.


=head2 AllowHeaders => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The HTTP headers that origins can include in requests to your function
URL. For example: C<Date>, C<Keep-Alive>, C<X-Custom-Header>.


=head2 AllowMethods => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The HTTP methods that are allowed when calling your function URL. For
example: C<GET>, C<POST>, C<DELETE>, or the wildcard character (C<*>).


=head2 AllowOrigins => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The origins that can access your function URL. You can list any number
of specific origins, separated by a comma. For example:
C<https://www.example.com>, C<http://localhost:60905>.

Alternatively, you can grant access to all origins using the wildcard
character (C<*>).


=head2 ExposeHeaders => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The HTTP headers in your function response that you want to expose to
origins that call your function URL. For example: C<Date>,
C<Keep-Alive>, C<X-Custom-Header>.


=head2 MaxAge => Int

The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that web browsers can cache
results of a preflight request. By default, this is set to C<0>, which
means that the browser doesn't cache results.
