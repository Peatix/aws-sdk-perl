=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::FunctionUrlConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lambda::FunctionUrlConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthType => $value, ..., LastModifiedTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lambda::FunctionUrlConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about a Lambda function URL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AuthType => Str

The type of authentication that your function URL uses. Set to
C<AWS_IAM> if you want to restrict access to authenticated users only.
Set to C<NONE> if you want to bypass IAM authentication to create a
public endpoint. For more information, see Security and auth model for
Lambda function URLs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-auth.html).


=head2 Cors => L<Paws::Lambda::Cors>

The cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) settings for
your function URL.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

When the function URL was created, in ISO-8601 format
(https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FunctionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your function.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FunctionUrl => Str

The HTTP URL endpoint for your function.


=head2 InvokeMode => Str

Use one of the following options:

=over

=item *

C<BUFFERED> E<ndash> This is the default option. Lambda invokes your
function using the C<Invoke> API operation. Invocation results are
available when the payload is complete. The maximum payload size is 6
MB.

=item *

C<RESPONSE_STREAM> E<ndash> Your function streams payload results as
they become available. Lambda invokes your function using the
C<InvokeWithResponseStream> API operation. The maximum response payload
size is 20 MB, however, you can request a quota increase
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html).

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastModifiedTime => Str

When the function URL configuration was last updated, in ISO-8601
format (https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime)
(YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD).
