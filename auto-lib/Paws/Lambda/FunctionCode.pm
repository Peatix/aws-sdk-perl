=head1 NAME

Paws::Lambda::FunctionCode

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lambda::FunctionCode object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImageUri => $value, ..., ZipFile => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lambda::FunctionCode object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImageUri

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The code for the Lambda function. You can either specify an object in
Amazon S3, upload a .zip file archive deployment package directly, or
specify the URI of a container image.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ImageUri => Str

URI of a container image
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html) in
the Amazon ECR registry.


=head2 S3Bucket => Str

An Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as your
function. The bucket can be in a different Amazon Web Services account.


=head2 S3Key => Str

The Amazon S3 key of the deployment package.


=head2 S3ObjectVersion => Str

For versioned objects, the version of the deployment package object to
use.


=head2 SourceKMSKeyArn => Str

The ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) customer managed key that's
used to encrypt your function's .zip deployment package. If you don't
provide a customer managed key, Lambda uses an Amazon Web Services
owned key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk).


=head2 ZipFile => Str

The base64-encoded contents of the deployment package. Amazon Web
Services SDK and CLI clients handle the encoding for you.
