=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::DbInstanceForClusterSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::DbInstanceForClusterSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::DbInstanceForClusterSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a summary of a DB instance belonging to a DB cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The amount of storage allocated for your DB storage type in GiB
(gibibytes).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB instance.


=head2 DbInstanceType => Str

The Timestream for InfluxDB instance type to run InfluxDB on.


=head2 DbStorageType => Str

The storage type for your DB instance.


=head2 DeploymentType => Str

Specifies the deployment type if applicable.


=head2 Endpoint => Str

The endpoint used to connect to InfluxDB. The default InfluxDB port is
8086.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The service-generated unique identifier of the DB instance.


=head2 InstanceMode => Str

Specifies the DB instance's role in the cluster.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A service-generated name for the DB instance based on the
customer-supplied name for the DB cluster.


=head2 NetworkType => Str

Specifies whether the network type of the Timestream for InfluxDB
instance is IPv4, which can communicate over IPv4 protocol only, or
DUAL, which can communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.


=head2 Port => Int
