=head1 NAME

Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::InfluxDBv2Parameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::InfluxDBv2Parameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FluxLogEnabled => $value, ..., UiDisabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::InfluxDBv2Parameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FluxLogEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All the customer-modifiable InfluxDB v2 parameters in Timestream for
InfluxDB.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FluxLogEnabled => Bool

Include option to show detailed logs for Flux queries.

Default: false


=head2 HttpIdleTimeout => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Maximum duration the server should keep established connections alive
while waiting for new requests. Set to 0 for no timeout.

Default: 3 minutes


=head2 HttpReadHeaderTimeout => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Maximum duration the server should try to read HTTP headers for new
requests. Set to 0 for no timeout.

Default: 10 seconds


=head2 HttpReadTimeout => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Maximum duration the server should try to read the entirety of new
requests. Set to 0 for no timeout.

Default: 0


=head2 HttpWriteTimeout => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Maximum duration the server should spend processing and responding to
write requests. Set to 0 for no timeout.

Default: 0


=head2 InfluxqlMaxSelectBuckets => Int

Maximum number of group by time buckets a SELECT statement can create.
0 allows an unlimited number of buckets.

Default: 0


=head2 InfluxqlMaxSelectPoint => Int

Maximum number of points a SELECT statement can process. 0 allows an
unlimited number of points. InfluxDB checks the point count every
second (so queries exceeding the maximum arenE<rsquo>t immediately
aborted).

Default: 0


=head2 InfluxqlMaxSelectSeries => Int

Maximum number of series a SELECT statement can return. 0 allows an
unlimited number of series.

Default: 0


=head2 LogLevel => Str

Log output level. InfluxDB outputs log entries with severity levels
greater than or equal to the level specified.

Default: info


=head2 MetricsDisabled => Bool

Disable the HTTP /metrics endpoint which exposes internal InfluxDB
metrics
(https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/internals/metrics/).

Default: false


=head2 NoTasks => Bool

Disable the task scheduler. If problematic tasks prevent InfluxDB from
starting, use this option to start InfluxDB without scheduling or
executing tasks.

Default: false


=head2 PprofDisabled => Bool

Disable the /debug/pprof HTTP endpoint. This endpoint provides runtime
profiling data and can be helpful when debugging.

Default: true


=head2 QueryConcurrency => Int

Number of queries allowed to execute concurrently. Setting to 0 allows
an unlimited number of concurrent queries.

Default: 0


=head2 QueryInitialMemoryBytes => Int

Initial bytes of memory allocated for a query.

Default: 0


=head2 QueryMaxMemoryBytes => Int

Maximum number of queries allowed in execution queue. When queue limit
is reached, new queries are rejected. Setting to 0 allows an unlimited
number of queries in the queue.

Default: 0


=head2 QueryMemoryBytes => Int

Maximum bytes of memory allowed for a single query. Must be greater or
equal to queryInitialMemoryBytes.

Default: 0


=head2 QueryQueueSize => Int

Maximum number of queries allowed in execution queue. When queue limit
is reached, new queries are rejected. Setting to 0 allows an unlimited
number of queries in the queue.

Default: 0


=head2 SessionLength => Int

Specifies the Time to Live (TTL) in minutes for newly created user
sessions.

Default: 60


=head2 SessionRenewDisabled => Bool

Disables automatically extending a userE<rsquo>s session TTL on each
request. By default, every request sets the sessionE<rsquo>s expiration
time to five minutes from now. When disabled, sessions expire after the
specified session length
(https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/config-options/#session-length)
and the user is redirected to the login page, even if recently active.

Default: false


=head2 StorageCacheMaxMemorySize => Int

Maximum size (in bytes) a shardE<rsquo>s cache can reach before it
starts rejecting writes. Must be greater than
storageCacheSnapShotMemorySize and lower than instanceE<rsquo>s total
memory capacity. We recommend setting it to below 15% of the total
memory capacity.

Default: 1073741824


=head2 StorageCacheSnapshotMemorySize => Int

Size (in bytes) at which the storage engine will snapshot the cache and
write it to a TSM file to make more memory available. Must not be
greater than storageCacheMaxMemorySize.

Default: 26214400


=head2 StorageCacheSnapshotWriteColdDuration => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Duration at which the storage engine will snapshot the cache and write
it to a new TSM file if the shard hasnE<rsquo>t received writes or
deletes.

Default: 10 minutes


=head2 StorageCompactFullWriteColdDuration => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Duration at which the storage engine will compact all TSM files in a
shard if it hasn't received writes or deletes.

Default: 4 hours


=head2 StorageCompactThroughputBurst => Int

Rate limit (in bytes per second) that TSM compactions can write to
disk.

Default: 50331648


=head2 StorageMaxConcurrentCompactions => Int

Maximum number of full and level compactions that can run concurrently.
A value of 0 results in 50% of runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) used at runtime.
Any number greater than zero limits compactions to that value. This
setting does not apply to cache snapshotting.

Default: 0


=head2 StorageMaxIndexLogFileSize => Int

Size (in bytes) at which an index write-ahead log (WAL) file will
compact into an index file. Lower sizes will cause log files to be
compacted more quickly and result in lower heap usage at the expense of
write throughput.

Default: 1048576


=head2 StorageNoValidateFieldSize => Bool

Skip field size validation on incoming write requests.

Default: false


=head2 StorageRetentionCheckInterval => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Interval of retention policy enforcement checks. Must be greater than
0.

Default: 30 minutes


=head2 StorageSeriesFileMaxConcurrentSnapshotCompactions => Int

Maximum number of snapshot compactions that can run concurrently across
all series partitions in a database.

Default: 0


=head2 StorageSeriesIdSetCacheSize => Int

Size of the internal cache used in the TSI index to store previously
calculated series results. Cached results are returned quickly rather
than needing to be recalculated when a subsequent query with the same
tag key/value predicate is executed. Setting this value to 0 will
disable the cache and may decrease query performance.

Default: 100


=head2 StorageWalMaxConcurrentWrites => Int

Maximum number writes to the WAL directory to attempt at the same time.
Setting this value to 0 results in number of processing units available
x2.

Default: 0


=head2 StorageWalMaxWriteDelay => L<Paws::TimestreamInfluxDB::Duration>

Maximum amount of time a write request to the WAL directory will wait
when the maximum number of concurrent active writes to the WAL
directory has been met
(https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/reference/config-options/#storage-wal-max-concurrent-writes).
Set to 0 to disable the timeout.

Default: 10 minutes


=head2 TracingType => Str

Enable tracing in InfluxDB and specifies the tracing type. Tracing is
disabled by default.


=head2 UiDisabled => Bool

Disable the InfluxDB user interface (UI). The UI is enabled by default.

Default: false
