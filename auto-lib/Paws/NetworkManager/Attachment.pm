=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkManager::Attachment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkManager::Attachment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttachmentId => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkManager::Attachment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttachmentId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a core network attachment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttachmentId => Str

The ID of the attachment.


=head2 AttachmentPolicyRuleNumber => Int

The policy rule number associated with the attachment.


=head2 AttachmentType => Str

The type of attachment.


=head2 CoreNetworkArn => Str

The ARN of a core network.


=head2 CoreNetworkId => Str

The ID of a core network.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The timestamp when the attachment was created.


=head2 EdgeLocation => Str

The Region where the edge is located. This is returned for all
attachment types except a Direct Connect gateway attachment, which
instead returns C<EdgeLocations>.


=head2 EdgeLocations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The edge locations that the Direct Connect gateway is associated with.
This is returned only for Direct Connect gateway attachments. All other
attachment types retrun C<EdgeLocation>.


=head2 LastModificationErrors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkManager::AttachmentError>]

Describes the error associated with the attachment request.


=head2 NetworkFunctionGroupName => Str

The name of the network function group.


=head2 OwnerAccountId => Str

The ID of the attachment account owner.


=head2 ProposedNetworkFunctionGroupChange => L<Paws::NetworkManager::ProposedNetworkFunctionGroupChange>

Describes a proposed change to a network function group associated with
the attachment.


=head2 ProposedSegmentChange => L<Paws::NetworkManager::ProposedSegmentChange>

The attachment to move from one segment to another.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

The attachment resource ARN.


=head2 SegmentName => Str

The name of the segment attachment.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the attachment.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkManager::Tag>]

The tags associated with the attachment.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The timestamp when the attachment was last updated.
