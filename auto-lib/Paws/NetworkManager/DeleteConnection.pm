=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkManager::DeleteConnection - Arguments for method DeleteConnection on L<Paws::NetworkManager>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteConnection on the
L<AWS Network Manager|Paws::NetworkManager> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteConnection.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteConnection.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $networkmanager = Paws->service('NetworkManager');
    my $DeleteConnectionResponse = $networkmanager->DeleteConnection(
      ConnectionId    => 'MyConnectionId',
      GlobalNetworkId => 'MyGlobalNetworkId',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Connection = $DeleteConnectionResponse->Connection;

    # Returns a L<Paws::NetworkManager::DeleteConnectionResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
