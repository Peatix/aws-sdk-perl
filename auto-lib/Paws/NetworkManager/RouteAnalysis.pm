=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysis

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysis object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., UseMiddleboxes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysis object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a route analysis.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => L<Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysisEndpointOptions>

The destination.


=head2 ForwardPath => L<Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysisPath>

The forward path.


=head2 GlobalNetworkId => Str

The ID of the global network.

=head2 Source => L<Paws::NetworkManager::RouteAnalysisEndpointOptions>

The source.


=head2 StartTimestamp => Str

The time that the analysis started.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the route analysis.


=head2 UseMiddleboxes => Bool

Indicates whether to include the location of middlebox appliances in
the route analysis.
