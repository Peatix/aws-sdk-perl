=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkManager::ServiceInsertionAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkManager::ServiceInsertionAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., WhenSentTo => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkManager::ServiceInsertionAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the action that the service insertion will take for any
segments associated with it.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => Str

The action the service insertion takes for traffic. C<send-via> sends
east-west traffic between attachments. C<send-to> sends north-south
traffic to the security appliance, and then from that to either the
Internet or to an on-premesis location.


=head2 Mode => Str

Describes the mode packets take for the C<send-via> action. This is not
used when the action is C<send-to>. C<dual-hop> packets traverse
attachments in both the source to the destination core network edges.
This mode requires that an inspection attachment must be present in all
Regions of the service insertion-enabled segments. For C<single-hop>,
packets traverse a single intermediate inserted attachment. You can use
C<EdgeOverride> to specify a specific edge to use.


=head2 Via => L<Paws::NetworkManager::Via>

The list of network function groups and any edge overrides for the
chosen service insertion action. Used for both C<send-to> or
C<send-via>.


=head2 WhenSentTo => L<Paws::NetworkManager::WhenSentTo>

The list of destination segments if the service insertion action is
C<send-via>.
