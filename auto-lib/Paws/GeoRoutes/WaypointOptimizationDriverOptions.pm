=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationDriverOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationDriverOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RestCycles => $value, ..., TreatServiceTimeAs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationDriverOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RestCycles

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Driver related options.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RestCycles => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationRestCycles>

Driver work-rest schedules defined by a short and long cycle. A rest
needs to be taken after the short work duration. The short cycle can be
repeated until you hit the long work duration, at which point the long
rest duration should be taken before restarting.


=head2 RestProfile => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationRestProfile>

Pre defined rest profiles for a driver schedule. The only currently
supported profile is EU.


=head2 TreatServiceTimeAs => Str

If the service time provided at a waypoint/destination should be
considered as rest or work. This contributes to the total time
breakdown returned within the response.



=head1 SEE ALSO
