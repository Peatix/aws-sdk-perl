B<Unit>: C<meters>


=head2 Duration => Int

Duration of the computed span. This feature doesn't split a span, but
is always computed on a span split by other properties.

B<Unit>: C<seconds>


=head2 GeometryOffset => Int

Offset in the leg geometry corresponding to the start of this span.


=head2 Names => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GeoRoutes::LocalizedString>]

Provides an array of names of the ferry span in available languages.


=head2 Region => Str

2-3 letter Region code corresponding to the Span. This is either a
province or a state.
