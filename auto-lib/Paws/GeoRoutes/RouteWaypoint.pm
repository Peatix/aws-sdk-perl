=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteWaypoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteWaypoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvoidActionsForDistance => $value, ..., StopDuration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteWaypoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvoidActionsForDistance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Waypoint between the Origin and Destination.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvoidActionsForDistance => Int

Avoids actions for the provided distance. This is typically to consider
for users in moving vehicles who may not have sufficient time to make
an action at an origin or a destination.


=head2 AvoidUTurns => Bool

Avoid U-turns for calculation on highways and motorways.


=head2 Heading => Num

GPS Heading at the position.


=head2 Matching => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatchingOptions>

Options to configure matching the provided position to the road
network.


=head2 PassThrough => Bool

If the waypoint should not be treated as a stop. If yes, the waypoint
is passed through and doesn't split the route into different legs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Position => ArrayRef[Num]

Position defined as C<[longitude, latitude]>.


=head2 SideOfStreet => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteSideOfStreetOptions>

Options to configure matching the provided position to a side of the
street.


=head2 StopDuration => Int

Duration of the stop.

B<Unit>: C<seconds>
