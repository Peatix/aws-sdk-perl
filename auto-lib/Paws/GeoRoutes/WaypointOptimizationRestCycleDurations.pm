=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationRestCycleDurations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationRestCycleDurations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RestDuration => $value, ..., WorkDuration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationRestCycleDurations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RestDuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Driver work-rest schedules defined by a short and long cycle. A rest
needs to be taken after the short work duration. The short cycle can be
repeated until you hit the long work duration, at which point the long
rest duration should be taken before restarting.
