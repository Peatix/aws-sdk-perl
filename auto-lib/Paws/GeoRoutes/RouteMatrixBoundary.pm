=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Geometry => $value, ..., Unbounded => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Geometry

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Boundary within which the matrix is to be calculated. All data, origins
and destinations outside the boundary are considered invalid.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Geometry => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundaryGeometry>

Geometry of the area to be avoided.


=head2 Unbounded => Bool

No restrictions in terms of a routing boundary, and is typically used
for longer routes.



=head1 SEE ALSO
