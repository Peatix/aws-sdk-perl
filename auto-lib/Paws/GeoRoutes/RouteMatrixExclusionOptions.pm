=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixExclusionOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixExclusionOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Countries => $value, ..., Countries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixExclusionOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Countries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies strict exclusion options for the route calculation. This
setting mandates that the router will avoid any routes that include the
specified options, rather than merely attempting to minimize them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

country codes.
