=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineConnection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineConnection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FromPolygonIndex => $value, ..., ToPolygonIndex => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineConnection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FromPolygonIndex

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Isolines may contain multiple components, if these components are
connected by ferry links. These components are returned as separate
polygons while the ferry links are returned as connections.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FromPolygonIndex => Int

Index of the polygon corresponding to the "from" component of the
connection. The polygon is available from C<Isoline[].Geometries>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Geometry => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineConnectionGeometry>

The isoline geometry.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ToPolygonIndex => Int

Index of the polygon corresponding to the "to" component of the
connection. The polygon is available from C<Isoline[].Geometries>.
