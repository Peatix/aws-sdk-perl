=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundaryGeometry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundaryGeometry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoCircle => $value, ..., Polygon => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixBoundaryGeometry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoCircle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geometry of the routing boundary.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoCircle => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixAutoCircle>

Provides the circle that was used while calculating the route.


=head2 BoundingBox => ArrayRef[Num]

Geometry defined as a bounding box. The first pair represents the X and
Y coordinates (longitude and latitude,) of the southwest corner of the
bounding box; the second pair represents the X and Y coordinates
(longitude and latitude) of the northeast corner.


=head2 Circle => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::Circle>

Geometry defined as a circle. When request routing boundary was set as
C<AutoCircle>, the response routing boundary will return C<Circle>
derived from the C<AutoCircle> settings.


=head2 Polygon => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Num]]]

Geometry defined as a polygon with only one linear ring.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::GeoRoutes>
