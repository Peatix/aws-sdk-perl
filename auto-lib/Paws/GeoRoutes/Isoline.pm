=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::Isoline

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::Isoline object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Connections => $value, ..., TimeThreshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::Isoline object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Connections

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Calculated isolines and associated properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Connections => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineConnection>]

Isolines may contain multiple components, if these components are
connected by ferry links. These components are returned as separate
polygons while the ferry links are returned as connections.


=head2 DistanceThreshold => Int

Distance threshold corresponding to the calculated Isoline.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Geometries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineShapeGeometry>]

Geometries for the Calculated isolines.


=head2 TimeThreshold => Int

Time threshold corresponding to the calculated isoline.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::GeoRoutes>
