=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineShapeGeometry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineShapeGeometry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Polygon => $value, ..., PolylinePolygon => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineShapeGeometry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Polygon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geometry of the connection between different Isoline components.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Polygon => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Num]]]

A list of Isoline Polygons, for each isoline polygon, it contains
polygons of the first linear ring (the outer ring) and from 2nd item to
the last item (the inner rings).


=head2 PolylinePolygon => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Isoline PolylinePolygon, for each isoline PolylinePolygon, it
contains PolylinePolygon of the first linear ring (the outer ring) and
from 2nd item to the last item (the inner rings). For more information
on polyline encoding, see

(https://github.com/heremaps/flexiblepolyline/blob/master/README.md).
