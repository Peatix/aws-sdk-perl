=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineTrafficOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineTrafficOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FlowEventThresholdOverride => $value, ..., Usage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::IsolineTrafficOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FlowEventThresholdOverride

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Options related to traffic.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FlowEventThresholdOverride => Int

Duration for which flow traffic is considered valid. For this period,
the flow traffic is used over historical traffic data. Flow traffic
refers to congestion, which changes very quickly. Duration in seconds
for which flow traffic event would be considered valid. While flow
traffic event is valid it will be used over the historical traffic
data.

B<Unit>: C<seconds>


=head2 Usage => Str

Determines if traffic should be used or ignored while calculating the
route.

Default Value: C<UseTrafficData>
