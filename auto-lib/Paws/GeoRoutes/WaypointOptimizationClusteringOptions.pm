=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationClusteringOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationClusteringOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., DrivingDistanceOptions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationClusteringOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Options for WaypointOptimizationClustering.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Algorithm => Str

The algorithm to be used. C<DrivingDistance> assigns all the waypoints
that are within driving distance of each other into a single cluster.
C<TopologySegment> assigns all the waypoints that are within the same
topology segment into a single cluster. A Topology segment is a linear
stretch of road between two junctions.


=head2 DrivingDistanceOptions => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationDrivingDistanceOptions>

Driving distance options to be used when the clustering algorithm is
DrivingDistance.



=head1 SEE ALSO
