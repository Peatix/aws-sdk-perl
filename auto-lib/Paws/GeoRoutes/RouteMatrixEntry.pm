=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Distance => $value, ..., Error => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Distance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The calculated route matrix containing the results for all pairs of
Origins to Destination positions. Each row corresponds to one entry in
Origins. Each entry in the row corresponds to the route from that entry
in Origins to an entry in Destination positions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Distance => Int

The total distance of travel for the route.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Duration => Int

The expected duration of travel for the route.

B<Unit>: C<seconds>


=head2 Error => Str

Error code that occurred during calculation of the route.
