=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteViolatedConstraints

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteViolatedConstraints object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllHazardsRestricted => $value, ..., TunnelRestrictionCode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteViolatedConstraints object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllHazardsRestricted

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This property contains a summary of violated constraints.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllHazardsRestricted => Bool

This restriction applies to truck cargo, where the resulting route
excludes roads on which hazardous materials are prohibited from being
transported.


=head2 AxleCount => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteNoticeDetailRange>

Total number of axles of the vehicle.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> HazardousCargos => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

List of Hazardous cargo contained in the vehicle.


=head2 MaxHeight => Int

The maximum height of the vehicle.


=head2 MaxKpraLength => Int

The maximum Kpra length of the vehicle.

B<Unit>: C<centimeters>


=head2 MaxLength => Int

The maximum length of the vehicle.


=head2 MaxPayloadCapacity => Int

The maximum load capacity of the vehicle.

B<Unit>: C<kilograms>


=head2 MaxWeight => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteWeightConstraint>

The maximum weight of the route.

B<Unit>: C<Kilograms>


=head2 MaxWeightPerAxle => Int

The maximum weight per axle of the vehicle.

B<Unit>: C<Kilograms>


=head2 MaxWeightPerAxleGroup => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::WeightPerAxleGroup>

The maximum weight per axle group of the vehicle.

B<Unit>: C<Kilograms>


=head2 MaxWidth => Int

The maximum width of the vehicle.


=head2 Occupancy => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteNoticeDetailRange>

The number of occupants in the vehicle.

Default Value: C<1>


=head2 RestrictedTimes => Str

Access radius restrictions based on time.


=head2 TimeDependent => Bool

The time dependent constraint.


=head2 TrailerCount => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteNoticeDetailRange>

Number of trailers attached to the vehicle.

Default Value: C<0>


=head2 TravelMode => Bool

Travel mode corresponding to the leg.


=head2 TruckRoadType => Str

Truck road type identifiers. C<BK1> through C<BK4> apply only to
Sweden. C<A2,A4,B2,B4,C,D,ET2,ET4> apply only to Mexico.

There are currently no other supported values as of 26th April 2024.


=head2 TruckType => Str

Type of the truck.


=head2 TunnelRestrictionCode => Str

The tunnel restriction code.

Tunnel categories in this list indicate the restrictions which apply to
certain tunnels in Great Britain. They relate to the types of dangerous
goods that can be transported through them.
