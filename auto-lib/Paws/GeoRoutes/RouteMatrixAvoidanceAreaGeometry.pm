=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixAvoidanceAreaGeometry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixAvoidanceAreaGeometry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BoundingBox => $value, ..., PolylinePolygon => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixAvoidanceAreaGeometry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BoundingBox

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geometry of the area to be avoided.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BoundingBox => ArrayRef[Num]

Geometry defined as a bounding box. The first pair represents the X and
Y coordinates (longitude and latitude,) of the southwest corner of the
bounding box; the second pair represents the X and Y coordinates
(longitude and latitude) of the northeast corner.


=head2 Polygon => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Num]]]

Geometry defined as a polygon with only one linear ring.


=head2 PolylinePolygon => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Isoline PolylinePolygon, for each isoline PolylinePolygon, it
contains PolylinePolygon of the first linear ring (the outer ring) and
from second item to the last item (the inner rings). For more
information on polyline encoding, see
https://github.com/heremaps/flexiblepolyline/blob/master/README.md
(https://github.com/heremaps/flexiblepolyline/blob/master/README.md).
