=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationAvoidanceOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationAvoidanceOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Areas => $value, ..., UTurns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationAvoidanceOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Areas

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies options for areas to avoid. This is a best-effort avoidance
setting, meaning the router will try to honor the avoidance preferences
but may still include restricted areas if no feasible alternative route
exists. If avoidance options are not followed, the response will
indicate that the avoidance criteria were violated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Areas => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GeoRoutes::WaypointOptimizationAvoidanceArea>]

Areas to be avoided.


=head2 CarShuttleTrains => Bool

Avoidance options for cars-shuttles-trains.


=head2 ControlledAccessHighways => Bool

Avoid controlled access highways while calculating the route.


=head2 DirtRoads => Bool

Avoid dirt roads while calculating the route.


=head2 Ferries => Bool

Avoidance options for ferries.


=head2 TollRoads => Bool

Avoids roads where the specified toll transponders are the only mode of
payment.


=head2 Tunnels => Bool

Avoid tunnels while calculating the route.


=head2 UTurns => Bool

Avoid U-turns for calculation on highways and motorways.
