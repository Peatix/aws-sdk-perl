=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixMatchingOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixMatchingOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NameHint => $value, ..., Strategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMatrixMatchingOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->NameHint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Matching options.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 NameHint => Str

Attempts to match the provided position to a road similar to the
provided name.


=head2 OnRoadThreshold => Int

If the distance to a highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad is within
threshold, the waypoint will be snapped to the
highway/bridge/tunnel/sliproad.

B<Unit>: C<meters>


=head2 Radius => Int

Considers all roads within the provided radius to match the provided
destination to. The roads that are considered are determined by the
provided Strategy.

B<Unit>: C<Meters>


=head2 Strategy => Str

Strategy that defines matching of the position onto the road network.
MatchAny considers all roads possible, whereas MatchMostSignificantRoad
matches to the most significant road.
