could occur together within a single route. For example, a car
employing the use of a Ferry will contain Vehicle legs corresponding to
journey on land, and Ferry legs corresponding to the journey via Ferry.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MajorRoadLabels => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteMajorRoadLabel>]

Important labels including names and route numbers that differentiate
the current route from the alternatives presented.


=head2 Summary => L<Paws::GeoRoutes::RouteSummary>

Summarized details of the leg.
