=head1 NAME

Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorCapabilities

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorCapabilities object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., Selections => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorCapabilities object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the GPU accelerators used for jobs processed
by a fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => L<Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorCountRange>

The number of GPU accelerators specified for worker hosts in this
fleet.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Selections => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorSelection>]

A list of accelerator capabilities requested for this fleet. Only
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances that provide these capabilities
will be used. For example, if you specify both L4 and T4 chips,
Deadline Cloud will use Amazon EC2 instances that have either the L4 or
the T4 chip installed.
