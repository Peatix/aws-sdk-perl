=head1 NAME

Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorSelection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorSelection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Runtime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Deadline::AcceleratorSelection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a specific GPU accelerator required for an Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud worker host.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the chip used by the GPU accelerator.

If you specify C<l4> as the name of the accelerator, you must specify
C<latest> or C<grid:r550> as the runtime.

The available GPU accelerators are:

=over

=item *

C<t4> - NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU

=item *

C<a10g> - NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU

=item *

C<l4> - NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU

=item *

C<l40s> - NVIDIA L40S Tensor Core GPU

=back



=head2 Runtime => Str

Specifies the runtime driver to use for the GPU accelerator. You must
use the same runtime for all GPUs.

You can choose from the following runtimes:

=over

=item *

C<latest> - Use the latest runtime available for the chip. If you
specify C<latest> and a new version of the runtime is released, the new
version of the runtime is used.

=item *

C<grid:r550> - NVIDIA vGPU software 17
(https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/17.0/index.html)

=item *

C<grid:r535> - NVIDIA vGPU software 16
(https://docs.nvidia.com/vgpu/16.0/index.html)

=back

If you don't specify a runtime, Deadline Cloud uses C<latest> as the
default. However, if you have multiple accelerators and specify
C<latest> for some and leave others blank, Deadline Cloud raises an
exception.
