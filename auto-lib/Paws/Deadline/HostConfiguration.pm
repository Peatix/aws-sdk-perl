=head1 NAME

Paws::Deadline::HostConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Deadline::HostConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ScriptBody => $value, ..., ScriptTimeoutSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Deadline::HostConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ScriptBody

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a script that runs as a worker is starting up that you can use
to provide additional configuration for workers in your fleet.

To remove a script from a fleet, use the UpdateFleet
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateFleet.html)
operation with the C<hostConfiguration> C<scriptBody> parameter set to
an empty string ("").

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScriptBody => Str

The text of the script that runs as a worker is starting up that you
can use to provide additional configuration for workers in your fleet.
The script runs after a worker enters the C<STARTING> state and before
the worker processes tasks.

For more information about using the script, see Run scripts as an
administrator to configure workers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deadline-cloud/latest/developerguide/smf-admin.html)
in the I<Deadline Cloud Developer Guide>.

The script runs as an administrative user (C<sudo root> on Linux, as an
Administrator on Windows).


=head2 ScriptTimeoutSeconds => Int

The maximum time that the host configuration can run. If the timeout
expires, the worker enters the C<NOT RESPONDING> state and shuts down.
You are charged for the time that the worker is running the host
configuration script.

You should configure your fleet for a maximum of one worker while
testing your host configuration script to avoid starting additional
workers.

The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
