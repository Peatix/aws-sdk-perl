=head1 NAME

Paws::Deadline::LimitSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Deadline::LimitSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AmountRequirementName => $value, ..., UpdatedBy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Deadline::LimitSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AmountRequirementName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about a specific limit.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AmountRequirementName => Str

The value that you specify as the C<name> in the C<amounts> field of
the C<hostRequirements> in a step of a job template to declare the
limit requirement.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The Unix timestamp of the date and time that the limit was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedBy => Str

The user identifier of the person that created the limit.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CurrentCount => Int

The number of resources from the limit that are being used by jobs. The
result is delayed and may not be the count at the time that you called
the operation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DisplayName => Str

The unique identifier of the farm that contains the limit.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LimitId => Str

The unique identifier of the limit.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxCount => Int

The maximum number of resources constrained by this limit. When all of
the resources are in use, steps that require the limit won't be
scheduled until the resource is available.

The C<maxValue> must not be 0. If the value is -1, there is no
restriction on the number of resources that can be acquired for this
limit.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The Unix timestamp of the date and time that the limit was last
updated.


=head2 UpdatedBy => Str
