=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments - Arguments for method DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments on L<Paws::DMS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments on the
L<AWS Database Migration Service|Paws::DMS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dms = Paws->service('DMS');
    my $DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessmentsResponse =
      $dms->DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments(
      Marker                 => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      MaxRecords             => 1,              # OPTIONAL
      MigrationType          => 'full-load',    # OPTIONAL
      ReplicationConfigArn   => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      ReplicationInstanceArn => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      ReplicationTaskArn     => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      SourceEngineName       => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      TargetEngineName       => 'MyString',     # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $IndividualAssessmentNames =
      $DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessmentsResponse
      ->IndividualAssessmentNames;
    my $Marker = $DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessmentsResponse->Marker;

# Returns a L<Paws::DMS::DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessmentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/dms/DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments>
