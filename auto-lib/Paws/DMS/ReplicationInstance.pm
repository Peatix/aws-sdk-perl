=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::ReplicationInstance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::ReplicationInstance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::ReplicationInstance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines a replication instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The amount of storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for the
replication instance.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

Boolean value indicating if minor version upgrades will be
automatically applied to the instance.


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone for the instance.


=head2 DnsNameServers => Str

The DNS name servers supported for the replication instance to access
your on-premise source or target database.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The engine version number of the replication instance.

If an engine version number is not specified when a replication
instance is created, the default is the latest engine version
available.

When modifying a major engine version of an instance, also set
C<AllowMajorVersionUpgrade> to C<true>.


=head2 FreeUntil => Str

The expiration date of the free replication instance that is part of
the Free DMS program.


=head2 InstanceCreateTime => Str

The time the replication instance was created.


=head2 KerberosAuthenticationSettings => L<Paws::DMS::KerberosAuthenticationSettings>

Specifies the settings required for kerberos authentication when
replicating an instance.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the
replication instance.

If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId> parameter, then DMS
uses your default encryption key.

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 MultiAZ => Bool

Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
You can't set the C<AvailabilityZone> parameter if the Multi-AZ
parameter is set to C<true>.


=head2 NetworkType => Str

The type of IP address protocol used by a replication instance, such as
IPv4 only or Dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
IPv6 only is not yet supported.


=head2 PendingModifiedValues => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationPendingModifiedValues>

The pending modification values.


=head2 PreferredMaintenanceWindow => Str

The maintenance window times for the replication instance. Any pending
upgrades to the replication instance are performed during this time.


=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance. A
value of C<true> represents an instance with a public IP address. A
value of C<false> represents an instance with a private IP address. The
default value is C<true>.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceClass => Str

The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as defined
for the specified replication instance class. It is a required
parameter, although a default value is pre-selected in the DMS console.

For more information on the settings and capacities for the available
replication instance classes, see Selecting the right DMS replication
instance for your migration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.html#CHAP_ReplicationInstance.InDepth).


=head2 ReplicationInstanceIdentifier => Str

The replication instance identifier is a required parameter. This
parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must contain 1-63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

=item *

First character must be a letter.

=item *

Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

=back

Example: C<myrepinstance>


=head2 ReplicationInstanceIpv6Addresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more IPv6 addresses for the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddress => Str

The private IP address of the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstancePrivateIpAddresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more private IP addresses for the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddress => Str

The public IP address of the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstancePublicIpAddresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more public IP addresses for the replication instance.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceStatus => Str

The status of the replication instance. The possible return values
include:

=head2 ReplicationSubnetGroup => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationSubnetGroup>

The subnet group for the replication instance.


=head2 SecondaryAvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone of the standby replication instance in a Multi-AZ
deployment.


=head2 VpcSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DMS::VpcSecurityGroupMembership>]

The VPC security group for the instance.
