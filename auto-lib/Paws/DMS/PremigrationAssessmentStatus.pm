=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::PremigrationAssessmentStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::PremigrationAssessmentStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssessmentProgress => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::PremigrationAssessmentStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssessmentProgress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The results returned in C<describe-replications> to display the results
of the premigration assessment from the replication configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssessmentProgress => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunProgress>




=head2 FailOnAssessmentFailure => Bool

A configurable setting you can set to C<true> (the defualt setting) or
C<false>. Use this setting to to stop the replication from starting
automatically if the assessment fails. This can help you evaluate the
issue that is preventing the replication from running successfully.


=head2 LastFailureMessage => Str

The last message generated by an individual assessment failure.


=head2 PremigrationAssessmentRunArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this assessment run.


=head2 PremigrationAssessmentRunCreationDate => Str

The date which the assessment run was created.


=head2 ResultEncryptionMode => Str

The supported values are C<SSE_KMS> and C<SSE_S3>. If these values are
not provided, then the files are not encrypted at rest. For more
information, see Creating Amazon Web Services KMS keys to encrypt
Amazon S3 target objects
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.S3.html#CHAP_Target.S3.KMSKeys).


=head2 ResultKmsKeyArn => Str

The ARN of a custom KMS encryption key that you specify when you set
C<ResultEncryptionMode> to C<SSE_KMS>.


=head2 ResultLocationBucket => Str

The Amazon S3 bucket that Database Migration Service Serverless created
to store the results of this assessment run.


=head2 ResultLocationFolder => Str

The folder within an Amazon S3 bucket where you want Database Migration
Service to store the results of this assessment run.


=head2 ResultStatistic => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunResultStatistic>




=head2 Status => Str

This describes the assessment run status. The status can be one of the
following values:

=over

=item *

C<cancelling>: The assessment run was canceled.

=item *

C<deleting>: The assessment run was deleted.

=item *

C<failed>: At least one individual assessment completed with a failed
status.

=item *

C<error-provisioning>: An internal error occurred while resources were
provisioned (during the C<provisioning> status).

=item *

C<error-executing> An internal error occurred while individual
assessments ran (during the C<running> status).

=item *

C<invalid state>: The assessment run is in an unknown state.

=item *

C<passed>: All individual assessments have completed and none have a
failed status.

=item *

C<provisioning>: The resources required to run individual assessments
are being provisioned.

=item *

C<running>: Individual assessments are being run.

=item *

C<starting>: The assessment run is starting, but resources are not yet
being provisioned for individual assessments.

=item *

C<warning>: At least one individual assessment completed with a warning
