=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::InstanceProfile

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::InstanceProfile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZone => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::InstanceProfile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines an instance profile.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone where the instance profile runs.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the instance profile. Descriptions can have up to 31
characters. A description can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
hyphens ('-'). Also, it can't end with a hyphen or contain two
consecutive hyphens, and can only begin with a letter.


=head2 InstanceProfileArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies the
instance profile.


=head2 InstanceProfileCreationTime => Str

The time the instance profile was created.


=head2 InstanceProfileName => Str

The user-friendly name for the instance profile.


=head2 KmsKeyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key that is used to encrypt
the connection parameters for the instance profile.

If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyArn> parameter, then DMS
uses your default encryption key.

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 NetworkType => Str

Specifies the network type for the instance profile. A value of C<IPV4>
represents an instance profile with IPv4 network type and only supports
IPv4 addressing. A value of C<IPV6> represents an instance profile with
IPv6 network type and only supports IPv6 addressing. A value of C<DUAL>
represents an instance profile with dual network type that supports
IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.


=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Specifies the accessibility options for the instance profile. A value
of C<true> represents an instance profile with a public IP address. A
value of C<false> represents an instance profile with a private IP
address. The default value is C<true>.


=head2 SubnetGroupIdentifier => Str

The identifier of the subnet group that is associated with the instance
profile.


=head2 VpcSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The VPC security groups that are used with the instance profile. The
VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the instance
profile.
