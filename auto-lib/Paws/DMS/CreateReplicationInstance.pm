=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::CreateReplicationInstance - Arguments for method CreateReplicationInstance on L<Paws::DMS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateReplicationInstance on the
L<AWS Database Migration Service|Paws::DMS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateReplicationInstance.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateReplicationInstance.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dms = Paws->service('DMS');
    # Create replication instance
    # Creates the replication instance using the specified parameters.
    my $CreateReplicationInstanceResponse = $dms->CreateReplicationInstance(
      'AllocatedStorage'                 => 123,
      'AutoMinorVersionUpgrade'          => 1,
      'AvailabilityZone'                 => '',
      'EngineVersion'                    => '',
      'KmsKeyId'                         => '',
      'MultiAZ'                          => 1,
      'PreferredMaintenanceWindow'       => '',
      'PubliclyAccessible'               => 1,
      'ReplicationInstanceClass'         => '',
      'ReplicationInstanceIdentifier'    => '',
      'ReplicationSubnetGroupIdentifier' => '',
      'Tags'                             => [

        {
          'Key'   => 'string',
          'Value' => 'string'
        }
      ],
      'VpcSecurityGroupIds' => [

      ]
    );

    # Results:
    my $ReplicationInstance =
      $CreateReplicationInstanceResponse->ReplicationInstance;

    # Returns a L<Paws::DMS::CreateReplicationInstanceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/dms/CreateReplicationInstance>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be initially allocated for the
replication instance.



=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied
automatically to the replication instance during the maintenance
window. This parameter defaults to C<true>.

Default: C<true>



=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone where the replication instance will be created.
The default value is a random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the
endpoint's Amazon Web Services Region, for example: C<us-east-1d>.



=head2 DnsNameServers => Str

A list of custom DNS name servers supported for the replication
instance to access your on-premise source or target database. This list
overrides the default name servers supported by the replication
instance. You can specify a comma-separated list of internet addresses
for up to four on-premise DNS name servers. For example:
C<"1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4">



=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The engine version number of the replication instance.

If an engine version number is not specified when a replication
instance is created, the default is the latest engine version
available.



=head2 KerberosAuthenticationSettings => L<Paws::DMS::KerberosAuthenticationSettings>

Specifies the settings required for kerberos authentication when
creating the replication instance.



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the data on the
replication instance.

If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId> parameter, then DMS
uses your default encryption key.

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.



=head2 MultiAZ => Bool

Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
You can't set the C<AvailabilityZone> parameter if the Multi-AZ
parameter is set to C<true>.



=head2 NetworkType => Str

The type of IP address protocol used by a replication instance, such as
IPv4 only or Dual-stack that supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
IPv6 only is not yet supported.



=head2 PreferredMaintenanceWindow => Str

The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

Format: C<ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi>

Default: A 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of
time per Amazon Web Services Region, occurring on a random day of the
week.

Valid Days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun

Constraints: Minimum 30-minute window.



=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Specifies the accessibility options for the replication instance. A
value of C<true> represents an instance with a public IP address. A
value of C<false> represents an instance with a private IP address. The
default value is C<true>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReplicationInstanceClass => Str

The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as defined
for the specified replication instance class. For example to specify
the instance class dms.c4.large, set this parameter to
C<"dms.c4.large">.

For more information on the settings and capacities for the available
replication instance classes, see Choosing the right DMS replication
instance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Types.html
); and, Selecting the best size for a replication instance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_BestPractices.SizingReplicationInstance.html).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReplicationInstanceIdentifier => Str

The replication instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a
lowercase string.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must contain 1-63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

=item *

First character must be a letter.

=item *

Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

=back

Example: C<myrepinstance>



=head2 ReplicationSubnetGroupIdentifier => Str

A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.



=head2 ResourceIdentifier => Str

A friendly name for the resource identifier at the end of the
C<EndpointArn> response parameter that is returned in the created
C<Endpoint> object. The value for this parameter can have up to 31
characters. It can contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphen
('-'). Also, it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive
hyphens, and can only begin with a letter, such as C<Example-App-ARN1>.
For example, this value might result in the C<EndpointArn> value
C<arn:aws:dms:eu-west-1:012345678901:rep:Example-App-ARN1>. If you
don't specify a C<ResourceIdentifier> value, DMS generates a default
identifier value for the end of C<EndpointArn>.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DMS::Tag>]

One or more tags to be assigned to the replication instance.



=head2 VpcSecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the VPC security group to be used with the replication
instance. The VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the
replication instance.
