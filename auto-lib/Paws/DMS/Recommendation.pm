=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::Recommendation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::Recommendation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedDate => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::Recommendation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedDate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that describes a recommendation of a target
engine.

A I<recommendation> is a set of possible Amazon Web Services target
engines that you can choose to migrate your source on-premises
database. In this set, Fleet Advisor suggests a single target engine as
the right sized migration destination. To determine this rightsized
migration destination, Fleet Advisor uses the inventory metadata and
metrics from data collector. You can use recommendations before the
start of migration to save costs and reduce risks.

With recommendations, you can explore different target options and
compare metrics, so you can make an informed decision when you choose
the migration target.
