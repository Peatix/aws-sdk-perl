=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::SybaseSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::SybaseSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatabaseName => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::SybaseSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatabaseName

=head2 SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn => Str

The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that specifies DMS

Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that allows access to the
SAP ASE endpoint.

You can specify one of two sets of values for these permissions. You
can specify the values for this setting and C<SecretsManagerSecretId>.
Or you can specify clear-text values for C<UserName>, C<Password>,
C<ServerName>, and C<Port>. You can't specify both. For more
information on creating this C<SecretsManagerSecret> and the
C<SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn> and C<SecretsManagerSecretId> required
to access it, see Using secrets to access Database Migration Service
resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html#security-iam-secretsmanager)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.
