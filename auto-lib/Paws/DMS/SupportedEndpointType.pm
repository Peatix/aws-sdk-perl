=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::SupportedEndpointType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::SupportedEndpointType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointType => $value, ..., SupportsCDC => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::SupportedEndpointType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about types of supported endpoints in response to
a request by the C<DescribeEndpointTypes> operation. This information
includes the type of endpoint, the database engine name, and whether
change data capture (CDC) is supported.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndpointType => Str

The type of endpoint. Valid values are C<source> and C<target>.


=head2 EngineDisplayName => Str

The expanded name for the engine name. For example, if the
C<EngineName> parameter is "aurora", this value would be "Amazon Aurora
MySQL".


=head2 EngineName => Str

The database engine name. Valid values, depending on the EndpointType,
include C<"mysql">, C<"oracle">, C<"postgres">, C<"mariadb">,
C<"aurora">, C<"aurora-postgresql">, C<"redshift">, C<"s3">, C<"db2">,
C<"db2-zos">, C<"azuredb">, C<"sybase">, C<"dynamodb">, C<"mongodb">,
C<"kinesis">, C<"kafka">, C<"elasticsearch">, C<"documentdb">,
C<"sqlserver">, C<"neptune">, and C<"babelfish">.


=head2 ReplicationInstanceEngineMinimumVersion => Str

The earliest DMS engine version that supports this endpoint engine.
Note that endpoint engines released with DMS versions earlier than
3.1.1 do not return a value for this parameter.


=head2 SupportsCDC => Bool

Indicates if change data capture (CDC) is supported.
