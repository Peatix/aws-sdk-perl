=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::Replication

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::Replication object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CdcStartPosition => $value, ..., TargetEndpointArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::Replication object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CdcStartPosition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that describes a serverless replication created by
the C<CreateReplication> operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CdcStartPosition => Str

Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation. Use
either C<CdcStartTime> or C<CdcStartPosition> to specify when you want
a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.


=head2 CdcStartTime => Str

Indicates the start time for a change data capture (CDC) operation. Use
either C<CdcStartTime> or C<CdcStartPosition> to specify when you want
a CDC operation to start. Specifying both values results in an error.


=head2 CdcStopPosition => Str

Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation to stop.
The value can be either server time or commit time.


=head2 FailureMessages => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Error and other information about why a serverless replication failed.


=head2 PremigrationAssessmentStatuses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DMS::PremigrationAssessmentStatus>]

The status output of premigration assessment in describe-replications.


=head2 ProvisionData => L<Paws::DMS::ProvisionData>

Information about provisioning resources for an DMS serverless
replication.


=head2 RecoveryCheckpoint => Str

Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during a change data
capture (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to the
C<CdcStartPosition> parameter to start a CDC operation that begins at
that checkpoint.


=head2 ReplicationConfigArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name for the C<ReplicationConfig> associated with
the replication.


=head2 ReplicationConfigIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the C<ReplicationConfig> associated with the
replication.


=head2 ReplicationCreateTime => Str

The time the serverless replication was created.


=head2 ReplicationDeprovisionTime => Str

The timestamp when DMS will deprovision the replication.


=head2 ReplicationLastStopTime => Str

The timestamp when replication was last stopped.


=head2 ReplicationStats => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationStats>

This object provides a collection of statistics about a serverless
replication.


=head2 ReplicationType => Str

The type of the serverless replication.


=head2 ReplicationUpdateTime => Str

The time the serverless replication was updated.


=head2 SourceEndpointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name for an existing C<Endpoint> the serverless
replication uses for its data source.


=head2 StartReplicationType => Str

The type of replication to start.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the serverless replication.


=head2 StopReason => Str

The reason the replication task was stopped. This response parameter
can return one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<"Stop Reason NORMAL">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason RECOVERABLE_ERROR">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason FATAL_ERROR">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason FULL_LOAD_ONLY_FINISHED">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_AFTER_FULL_LOAD"> E<ndash> Full load completed,
with cached changes not applied

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_AFTER_CACHED_EVENTS"> E<ndash> Full load
completed, with cached changes applied

=item *

C<"Stop Reason EXPRESS_LICENSE_LIMITS_REACHED">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_AFTER_DDL_APPLY"> E<ndash> User-defined stop
task after DDL applied

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_DUE_TO_LOW_MEMORY">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_DUE_TO_LOW_DISK">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_AT_SERVER_TIME"> E<ndash> User-defined server
time for stopping task

=item *

C<"Stop Reason STOPPED_AT_COMMIT_TIME"> E<ndash> User-defined commit
time for stopping task

=item *

C<"Stop Reason RECONFIGURATION_RESTART">

=item *

C<"Stop Reason RECYCLE_TASK">

=back



=head2 TargetEndpointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name for an existing C<Endpoint> the serverless
replication uses for its data target.
