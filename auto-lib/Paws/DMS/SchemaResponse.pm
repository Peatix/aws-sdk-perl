=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::SchemaResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::SchemaResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CodeLineCount => $value, ..., Similarity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::SchemaResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CodeLineCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector inventory.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CodeLineCount => Int

The number of lines of code in a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector
inventory.


=head2 CodeSize => Int

The size level of the code in a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector
inventory.


=head2 Complexity => Str

The complexity level of the code in a schema in a Fleet Advisor
collector inventory.


=head2 DatabaseInstance => L<Paws::DMS::DatabaseShortInfoResponse>

The database for a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector inventory.


=head2 OriginalSchema => L<Paws::DMS::SchemaShortInfoResponse>




=head2 SchemaId => Str

The ID of a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector inventory.


=head2 SchemaName => Str

The name of a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector inventory.


=head2 Server => L<Paws::DMS::ServerShortInfoResponse>

The database server for a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector
inventory.


=head2 Similarity => Num

The similarity value for a schema in a Fleet Advisor collector
inventory. A higher similarity value indicates that a schema is likely
to be a duplicate.



=head1 SEE ALSO
