=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::NeptuneSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::NeptuneSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorRetryDuration => $value, ..., ServiceAccessRoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::NeptuneSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorRetryDuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines an Amazon Neptune endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorRetryDuration => Int

The number of milliseconds for DMS to wait to retry a bulk-load of
migrated graph data to the Neptune target database before raising an
error. The default is 250.


=head2 IamAuthEnabled => Bool

If you want Identity and Access Management (IAM) authorization enabled
for this endpoint, set this parameter to C<true>. Then attach the
appropriate IAM policy document to your service role specified by
C<ServiceAccessRoleArn>. The default is C<false>.


=head2 MaxFileSize => Int

The maximum size in kilobytes of migrated graph data stored in a .csv
file before DMS bulk-loads the data to the Neptune target database. The
default is 1,048,576 KB. If the bulk load is successful, DMS clears the
bucket, ready to store the next batch of migrated graph data.


=head2 MaxRetryCount => Int

The number of times for DMS to retry a bulk load of migrated graph data
to the Neptune target database before raising an error. The default is
5.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3BucketFolder => Str

A folder path where you want DMS to store migrated graph data in the S3
bucket specified by C<S3BucketName>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3BucketName => Str

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where DMS can temporarily store
migrated graph data in .csv files before bulk-loading it to the Neptune
target database. DMS maps the SQL source data to graph data before
storing it in these .csv files.


=head2 ServiceAccessRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service role that you created for
the Neptune target endpoint. The role must allow the C<iam:PassRole>
action. For more information, see Creating an IAM Service Role for
Accessing Amazon Neptune as a Target
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Neptune.html#CHAP_Target.Neptune.ServiceRole)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide.>
