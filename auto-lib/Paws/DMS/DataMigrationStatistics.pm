=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::DataMigrationStatistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::DataMigrationStatistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CDCLatency => $value, ..., TablesQueued => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::DataMigrationStatistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CDCLatency

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the data migration run, including start and stop
time, latency, and migration progress.
