=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::Endpoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::Endpoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateArn => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::Endpoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used for SSL connection to the endpoint.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

The name of the database at the endpoint.


=head2 DmsTransferSettings => L<Paws::DMS::DmsTransferSettings>

The settings for the DMS Transfer type source. For more information,
see the DmsTransferSettings structure.

=head2 DynamoDbSettings => L<Paws::DMS::DynamoDbSettings>

The settings for the DynamoDB target endpoint. For more information,
see the C<DynamoDBSettings> structure.


=head2 ElasticsearchSettings => L<Paws::DMS::ElasticsearchSettings>

The settings for the OpenSearch source endpoint. For more information,
see the C<ElasticsearchSettings> structure.


=head2 EndpointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) string that uniquely identifies the
endpoint.


=head2 EndpointIdentifier => Str

The database endpoint identifier. Identifiers must begin with a letter
and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens. They can't
end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.


=head2 EndpointType => Str

The type of endpoint. Valid values are C<source> and C<target>.


=head2 EngineDisplayName => Str

The expanded name for the engine name. For example, if the
C<EngineName> parameter is "aurora", this value would be "Amazon Aurora
MySQL".


=head2 EngineName => Str

The database engine name. Valid values, depending on the EndpointType,
include C<"mysql">, C<"oracle">, C<"postgres">, C<"mariadb">,
C<"aurora">, C<"aurora-postgresql">, C<"redshift">,
C<"redshift-serverless">, C<"s3">, C<"db2">, C<"db2-zos">,
C<"azuredb">, C<"sybase">, C<"dynamodb">, C<"mongodb">, C<"kinesis">,
C<"kafka">, C<"elasticsearch">, C<"documentdb">, C<"sqlserver">,
C<"neptune">, and C<"babelfish">.


=head2 ExternalId => Str

Value returned by a call to CreateEndpoint that can be used for
cross-account validation. Use it on a subsequent call to CreateEndpoint
to create the endpoint with a cross-account.


=head2 ExternalTableDefinition => Str

The external table definition.


=head2 ExtraConnectionAttributes => Str

Additional connection attributes used to connect to the endpoint.


=head2 GcpMySQLSettings => L<Paws::DMS::GcpMySQLSettings>

Settings in JSON format for the source GCP MySQL endpoint.


=head2 IBMDb2Settings => L<Paws::DMS::IBMDb2Settings>

The settings for the IBM Db2 LUW source endpoint. For more information,
see the C<IBMDb2Settings> structure.


=head2 KafkaSettings => L<Paws::DMS::KafkaSettings>

The settings for the Apache Kafka target endpoint. For more
information, see the C<KafkaSettings> structure.


=head2 KinesisSettings => L<Paws::DMS::KinesisSettings>

The settings for the Amazon Kinesis target endpoint. For more
information, see the C<KinesisSettings> structure.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the connection parameters
for the endpoint.

If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId> parameter, then DMS
uses your default encryption key.

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

The settings for the Amazon Neptune target endpoint. For more
information, see the C<NeptuneSettings> structure.


=head2 OracleSettings => L<Paws::DMS::OracleSettings>

The settings for the Oracle source and target endpoint. For more
information, see the C<OracleSettings> structure.


=head2 Port => Int

The port value used to access the endpoint.
