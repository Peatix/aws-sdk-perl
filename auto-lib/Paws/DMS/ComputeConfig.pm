=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::ComputeConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::ComputeConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZone => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroupIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::ComputeConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration parameters for provisioning an DMS Serverless
replication.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone where the DMS Serverless replication using this
configuration will run. The default value is a random, system-chosen
Availability Zone in the configuration's Amazon Web Services Region,
for example, C<"us-west-2">. You can't set this parameter if the
C<MultiAZ> parameter is set to C<true>.


=head2 DnsNameServers => Str

A list of custom DNS name servers supported for the DMS Serverless
replication to access your source or target database. This list
overrides the default name servers supported by the DMS Serverless
replication. You can specify a comma-separated list of internet
addresses for up to four DNS name servers. For example:
C<"1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3,4.4.4.4">


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

An Key Management Service (KMS) key Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is
used to encrypt the data during DMS Serverless replication.

If you don't specify a value for the C<KmsKeyId> parameter, DMS uses
your default encryption key.

KMS creates the default encryption key for your Amazon Web Services
account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default
encryption key for each Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 MaxCapacityUnits => Int

Specifies the maximum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs) for which
a given DMS Serverless replication can be provisioned. A single DCU is
2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum value allowed. The list of valid
DCU values includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So,
the maximum value that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 384. The
C<MaxCapacityUnits> parameter is the only DCU parameter you are
required to specify.


=head2 MinCapacityUnits => Int

Specifies the minimum value of the DMS capacity units (DCUs) for which
a given DMS Serverless replication can be provisioned. A single DCU is
2GB of RAM, with 1 DCU as the minimum value allowed. The list of valid
DCU values includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 192, 256, and 384. So,
the minimum DCU value that you can specify for DMS Serverless is 1. If
you don't set this value, DMS sets this parameter to the minimum DCU
value allowed, 1. If there is no current source activity, DMS scales
down your replication until it reaches the value specified in
C<MinCapacityUnits>.


=head2 MultiAZ => Bool

Specifies whether the DMS Serverless replication is a Multi-AZ
deployment. You can't set the C<AvailabilityZone> parameter if the
C<MultiAZ> parameter is set to C<true>.


=head2 PreferredMaintenanceWindow => Str

The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur for the
DMS Serverless replication, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). The
format is C<ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi>.

The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
block of time per Amazon Web Services Region. This maintenance occurs
on a random day of the week. Valid values for days of the week include
C<Mon>, C<Tue>, C<Wed>, C<Thu>, C<Fri>, C<Sat>, and C<Sun>.

Constraints include a minimum 30-minute window.


=head2 ReplicationSubnetGroupId => Str

Specifies a subnet group identifier to associate with the DMS
Serverless replication.


=head2 VpcSecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the virtual private cloud (VPC) security group to use with
the DMS Serverless replication. The VPC security group must work with
the VPC containing the replication.
