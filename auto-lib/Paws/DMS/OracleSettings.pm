=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::OracleSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::OracleSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessAlternateDirectly => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::OracleSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessAlternateDirectly

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines an Oracle endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessAlternateDirectly => Bool

Set this attribute to C<false> in order to use the Binary Reader to
capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source. This
tells the DMS instance to not access redo logs through any specified
path prefix replacement using direct file access.


=head2 AdditionalArchivedLogDestId => Int

Set this attribute with C<ArchivedLogDestId> in a primary/ standby
setup. This attribute is useful in the case of a switchover. In this
case, DMS needs to know which destination to get archive redo logs from
to read changes. This need arises because the previous primary instance
is now a standby instance after switchover.

Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle C<RESETLOGS> option to open
the database, never use C<RESETLOGS> unless necessary. For additional
information about C<RESETLOGS>, see RMAN Data Repair Concepts
(https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/bradv/rman-data-repair-concepts.html#GUID-1805CCF7-4AF2-482D-B65A-998192F89C2B)
in the I<Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide>.


=head2 AddSupplementalLogging => Bool

Set this attribute to set up table-level supplemental logging for the
Oracle database. This attribute enables PRIMARY KEY supplemental
logging on all tables selected for a migration task.

If you use this option, you still need to enable database-level
supplemental logging.


=head2 AllowSelectNestedTables => Bool

Set this attribute to C<true> to enable replication of Oracle tables
containing columns that are nested tables or defined types.


=head2 ArchivedLogDestId => Int

Specifies the ID of the destination for the archived redo logs. This
value should be the same as a number in the dest_id column of the
v$archived_log view. If you work with an additional redo log
destination, use the C<AdditionalArchivedLogDestId> option to specify
the additional destination ID. Doing this improves performance by
ensuring that the correct logs are accessed from the outset.


=head2 ArchivedLogsOnly => Bool

When this field is set to C<True>, DMS only accesses the archived redo
logs. If the archived redo logs are stored on Automatic Storage
Management (ASM) only, the DMS user account needs to be granted ASM
privileges.


=head2 AsmPassword => Str

For an Oracle source endpoint, your Oracle Automatic Storage Management
(ASM) password. You can set this value from the C< I<asm_user_password>
> value. You set this value as part of the comma-separated value that
you set to the C<Password> request parameter when you create the
endpoint to access transaction logs using Binary Reader. For more
information, see Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on an
Oracle source database
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.CDC.Configuration).


=head2 AsmServer => Str

For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM server address. You can set
this value from the C<asm_server> value. You set C<asm_server> as part
of the extra connection attribute string to access an Oracle server
with Binary Reader that uses ASM. For more information, see
Configuration for change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle source
database
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.CDC.Configuration).


=head2 AsmUser => Str

For an Oracle source endpoint, your ASM user name. You can set this
value from the C<asm_user> value. You set C<asm_user> as part of the
extra connection attribute string to access an Oracle server with
Binary Reader that uses ASM. For more information, see Configuration
for change data capture (CDC) on an Oracle source database
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.CDC.Configuration).


=head2 AuthenticationMethod => Str

Specifies the authentication method to be used with Oracle.


=head2 CharLengthSemantics => Str

Specifies whether the length of a character column is in bytes or in
characters. To indicate that the character column length is in
characters, set this attribute to C<CHAR>. Otherwise, the character
column length is in bytes.

Example: C<charLengthSemantics=CHAR;>


=head2 ConvertTimestampWithZoneToUTC => Bool

When true, converts timestamps with the C<timezone> datatype to their
UTC value.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

Database name for the endpoint.


=head2 DirectPathNoLog => Bool

When set to C<true>, this attribute helps to increase the commit rate
on the Oracle target database by writing directly to tables and not
writing a trail to database logs.


=head2 DirectPathParallelLoad => Bool

When set to C<true>, this attribute specifies a parallel load when
C<useDirectPathFullLoad> is set to C<Y>. This attribute also only
applies when you use the DMS parallel load feature. Note that the
target table cannot have any constraints or indexes.


=head2 EnableHomogenousTablespace => Bool

Set this attribute to enable homogenous tablespace replication and
create existing tables or indexes under the same tablespace on the
target.


=head2 ExtraArchivedLogDestIds => ArrayRef[Int]

Specifies the IDs of one more destinations for one or more archived
redo logs. These IDs are the values of the C<dest_id> column in the
C<v$archived_log> view. Use this setting with the C<archivedLogDestId>
extra connection attribute in a primary-to-single setup or a
primary-to-multiple-standby setup.

This setting is useful in a switchover when you use an Oracle Data
Guard database as a source. In this case, DMS needs information about
what destination to get archive redo logs from to read changes. DMS
needs this because after the switchover the previous primary is a
standby instance. For example, in a primary-to-single standby setup you
might apply the following settings.

C<archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2]>

In a primary-to-multiple-standby setup, you might apply the following
settings.

C<archivedLogDestId=1; ExtraArchivedLogDestIds=[2,3,4]>

Although DMS supports the use of the Oracle C<RESETLOGS> option to open
the database, never use C<RESETLOGS> unless it's necessary. For more
information about C<RESETLOGS>, see RMAN Data Repair Concepts
(https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/bradv/rman-data-repair-concepts.html#GUID-1805CCF7-4AF2-482D-B65A-998192F89C2B)
in the I<Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide>.


=head2 FailTasksOnLobTruncation => Bool

When set to C<true>, this attribute causes a task to fail if the actual
size of an LOB column is greater than the specified C<LobMaxSize>.

If a task is set to limited LOB mode and this option is set to C<true>,
the task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.


=head2 NumberDatatypeScale => Int

Specifies the number scale. You can select a scale up to 38, or you can
select FLOAT. By default, the NUMBER data type is converted to
precision 38, scale 10.

Example: C<numberDataTypeScale=12>


=head2 OpenTransactionWindow => Int

The timeframe in minutes to check for open transactions for a CDC-only
task.

You can specify an integer value between 0 (the default) and 240 (the
maximum).

This parameter is only valid in DMS version 3.5.0 and later.


=head2 OraclePathPrefix => Str

Set this string attribute to the required value in order to use the
Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as
the source. This value specifies the default Oracle root used to access
the redo logs.


=head2 ParallelAsmReadThreads => Int

Set this attribute to change the number of threads that DMS configures
to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle Automatic
Storage Management (ASM). You can specify an integer value between 2
(the default) and 8 (the maximum). Use this attribute together with the
C<readAheadBlocks> attribute.


=head2 Password => Str

Endpoint connection password.


=head2 Port => Int

Endpoint TCP port.


=head2 ReadAheadBlocks => Int

Set this attribute to change the number of read-ahead blocks that DMS
configures to perform a change data capture (CDC) load using Oracle
Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You can specify an integer value
between 1000 (the default) and 200,000 (the maximum).


=head2 ReadTableSpaceName => Bool

When set to C<true>, this attribute supports tablespace replication.


=head2 ReplacePathPrefix => Bool

Set this attribute to true in order to use the Binary Reader to capture
change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source. This setting
tells DMS instance to replace the default Oracle root with the
specified C<usePathPrefix> setting to access the redo logs.


=head2 RetryInterval => Int

Specifies the number of seconds that the system waits before resending
a query.

Example: C<retryInterval=6;>


=head2 SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn => Str

The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that specifies DMS
as the trusted entity and grants the required permissions to access the
value in C<SecretsManagerSecret>. The role must allow the
C<iam:PassRole> action. C<SecretsManagerSecret> has the value of the
Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that allows access to the
Oracle endpoint.

You can specify one of two sets of values for these permissions. You
can specify the values for this setting and C<SecretsManagerSecretId>.
Or you can specify clear-text values for C<UserName>, C<Password>,
C<ServerName>, and C<Port>. You can't specify both. For more
information on creating this C<SecretsManagerSecret> and the
C<SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn> and C<SecretsManagerSecretId> required
to access it, see Using secrets to access Database Migration Service
resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html#security-iam-secretsmanager)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.


=head2 SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn => Str

Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses Automatic Storage Management
(ASM). The full ARN of the IAM role that specifies DMS as the trusted
entity and grants the required permissions to access the
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret>. This C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret>
has the secret value that allows access to the Oracle ASM of the
endpoint.

You can specify one of two sets of values for these permissions. You
can specify the values for this setting and
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId>. Or you can specify clear-text
values for C<AsmUser>, C<AsmPassword>, and C<AsmServerName>. You can't
specify both. For more information on creating this
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret> and the
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmAccessRoleArn> and
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId> required to access it, see Using
secrets to access Database Migration Service resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html#security-iam-secretsmanager)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.


=head2 SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecretId => Str

Required only if your Oracle endpoint uses Automatic Storage Management
(ASM). The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the
C<SecretsManagerOracleAsmSecret> that contains the Oracle ASM
connection details for the Oracle endpoint.


=head2 SecretsManagerSecretId => Str

The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the
C<SecretsManagerSecret> that contains the Oracle endpoint connection
details.


=head2 SecurityDbEncryption => Str

For an Oracle source endpoint, the transparent data encryption (TDE)
password required by AWM DMS to access Oracle redo logs encrypted by
TDE using Binary Reader. It is also the C< I<TDE_Password> > part of
the comma-separated value you set to the C<Password> request parameter
when you create the endpoint. The C<SecurityDbEncryptian> setting is
related to this C<SecurityDbEncryptionName> setting. For more
information, see Supported encryption methods for using Oracle as a
source for DMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.Encryption)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.


=head2 SecurityDbEncryptionName => Str

For an Oracle source endpoint, the name of a key used for the
transparent data encryption (TDE) of the columns and tablespaces in an
Oracle source database that is encrypted using TDE. The key value is
the value of the C<SecurityDbEncryption> setting. For more information
on setting the key name value of C<SecurityDbEncryptionName>, see the
information and example for setting the C<securityDbEncryptionName>
extra connection attribute in Supported encryption methods for using
Oracle as a source for DMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.Encryption)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.


=head2 ServerName => Str

Fully qualified domain name of the endpoint.

For an Amazon RDS Oracle instance, this is the output of
DescribeDBInstances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html),
in the C< Endpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Endpoint.html).Address>
field.


=head2 SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName => Str

Use this attribute to convert C<SDO_GEOMETRY> to C<GEOJSON> format. By
default, DMS calls the C<SDO2GEOJSON> custom function if present and
accessible. Or you can create your own custom function that mimics the
operation of C<SDOGEOJSON> and set
C<SpatialDataOptionToGeoJsonFunctionName> to call it instead.


=head2 StandbyDelayTime => Int

Use this attribute to specify a time in minutes for the delay in
standby sync. If the source is an Oracle Active Data Guard standby
database, use this attribute to specify the time lag between primary
and standby databases.

In DMS, you can create an Oracle CDC task that uses an Active Data
Guard standby instance as a source for replicating ongoing changes.
Doing this eliminates the need to connect to an active database that
might be in production.


=head2 TrimSpaceInChar => Bool

Use the C<TrimSpaceInChar> source endpoint setting to trim data on CHAR
and NCHAR data types during migration. The default value is C<true>.


=head2 UseAlternateFolderForOnline => Bool

Set this attribute to C<true> in order to use the Binary Reader to
capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source. This
tells the DMS instance to use any specified prefix replacement to
access all online redo logs.


=head2 UseBFile => Bool

Set this attribute to True to capture change data using the Binary
Reader utility. Set C<UseLogminerReader> to False to set this attribute
to True. To use Binary Reader with Amazon RDS for Oracle as the source,
you set additional attributes. For more information about using this
setting with Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM), see Using
Oracle LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.CDC).


=head2 UseDirectPathFullLoad => Bool

Set this attribute to True to have DMS use a direct path full load.
Specify this value to use the direct path protocol in the Oracle Call
Interface (OCI). By using this OCI protocol, you can bulk-load Oracle
target tables during a full load.


=head2 UseLogminerReader => Bool

Set this attribute to True to capture change data using the Oracle
LogMiner utility (the default). Set this attribute to False if you want
to access the redo logs as a binary file. When you set
C<UseLogminerReader> to False, also set C<UseBfile> to True. For more
information on this setting and using Oracle ASM, see Using Oracle
LogMiner or DMS Binary Reader for CDC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.Oracle.html#CHAP_Source.Oracle.CDC)
in the I<DMS User Guide>.


=head2 UsePathPrefix => Str

Set this string attribute to the required value in order to use the
Binary Reader to capture change data for an Amazon RDS for Oracle as
the source. This value specifies the path prefix used to replace the
default Oracle root to access the redo logs.


=head2 Username => Str

Endpoint connection user name.
