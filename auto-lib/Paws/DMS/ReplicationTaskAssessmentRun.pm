=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssessmentProgress => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssessmentProgress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that describes a premigration assessment run that
you have started using the C<StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun>
operation.

Some of the information appears based on other operations that can
return the C<ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun> object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssessmentProgress => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunProgress>

Indication of the completion progress for the individual assessments
specified to run.


=head2 AssessmentRunName => Str

Indicates that the following PreflightAssessmentRun is the latest for
the ReplicationTask. The status is either true or false.


=head2 LastFailureMessage => Str

Last message generated by an individual assessment failure.


=head2 ReplicationTaskArn => Str

ARN of the migration task associated with this premigration assessment
run.


=head2 ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this assessment run.


=head2 ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunCreationDate => Str

Date on which the assessment run was created using the
C<StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun> operation.


=head2 ResultEncryptionMode => Str

=head2 ResultKmsKeyArn => Str

ARN of the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the assessment run
results.


=head2 ResultLocationBucket => Str

Amazon S3 bucket where DMS stores the results of this assessment run.


=head2 ResultLocationFolder => Str

Folder in an Amazon S3 bucket where DMS stores the results of this
assessment run.


=head2 ResultStatistic => L<Paws::DMS::ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunResultStatistic>

Result statistics for a completed assessment run, showing aggregated
statistics of IndividualAssessments for how many assessments were
passed, failed, or encountered issues such as errors or warnings.


=head2 ServiceAccessRoleArn => Str

ARN of the service role used to start the assessment run using the
