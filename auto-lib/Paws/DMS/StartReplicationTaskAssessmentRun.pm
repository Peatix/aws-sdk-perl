=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun - Arguments for method StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun on L<Paws::DMS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun on the
L<AWS Database Migration Service|Paws::DMS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $dms = Paws->service('DMS');
    my $StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRunResponse =
      $dms->StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun(
      AssessmentRunName    => 'MyString',
      ReplicationTaskArn   => 'MyString',
      ResultLocationBucket => 'MyString',
      ServiceAccessRoleArn => 'MyString',
      Exclude              => [ 'MyString', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
      IncludeOnly          => [ 'MyString', ... ],    # OPTIONAL
      ResultEncryptionMode => 'MyString',             # OPTIONAL
      ResultKmsKeyArn      => 'MyString',             # OPTIONAL
      ResultLocationFolder => 'MyString',             # OPTIONAL
      Tags                 => [
        {
          Key         => 'MyString',
          ResourceArn => 'MyString',
          Value       => 'MyString',
        },
        ...
      ],                                              # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun =
      $StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRunResponse->ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun;

    # Returns a L<Paws::DMS::StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRunResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AssessmentRunName => Str

Unique name to identify the assessment run.



=head2 Exclude => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Space-separated list of names for specific individual assessments that
you want to exclude. These names come from the default list of
individual assessments that DMS supports for the associated migration
task. This task is specified by C<ReplicationTaskArn>.

You can't set a value for C<Exclude> if you also set a value for
C<IncludeOnly> in the API operation.

To identify the names of the default individual assessments that DMS
supports for the associated migration task, run the
C<DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments> operation using its own
C<ReplicationTaskArn> request parameter.



=head2 IncludeOnly => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Space-separated list of names for specific individual assessments that
you want to include. These names come from the default list of
individual assessments that DMS supports for the associated migration
task. This task is specified by C<ReplicationTaskArn>.

You can't set a value for C<IncludeOnly> if you also set a value for
C<Exclude> in the API operation.

To identify the names of the default individual assessments that DMS
supports for the associated migration task, run the
C<DescribeApplicableIndividualAssessments> operation using its own
C<ReplicationTaskArn> request parameter.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ReplicationTaskArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the migration task associated with the
premigration assessment run that you want to start.



=head2 ResultEncryptionMode => Str

Encryption mode that you can specify to encrypt the results of this
assessment run. If you don't specify this request parameter, DMS stores
the assessment run results without encryption. You can specify one of
the options following:

=over

=item *

C<"SSE_S3"> E<ndash> The server-side encryption provided as a default
by Amazon S3.

=item *

C<"SSE_KMS"> E<ndash> Key Management Service (KMS) encryption. This
encryption can use either a custom KMS encryption key that you specify
or the default KMS encryption key that DMS provides.

=back




=head2 ResultKmsKeyArn => Str

ARN of a custom KMS encryption key that you specify when you set
C<ResultEncryptionMode> to C<"SSE_KMS>".



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResultLocationBucket => Str

Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the results of this
assessment run.



=head2 ResultLocationFolder => Str

Folder within an Amazon S3 bucket where you want DMS to store the
results of this assessment run.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceAccessRoleArn => Str

ARN of the service role needed to start the assessment run. The role
must allow the C<iam:PassRole> action.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DMS::Tag>]

One or more tags to be assigned to the premigration assessment run that
you want to start.
