=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::TableStatistics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::TableStatistics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppliedDdls => $value, ..., ValidationSuspendedRecords => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::TableStatistics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppliedDdls

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a collection of table statistics in response to a request by
the C<DescribeTableStatistics> operation.

(valid only for migrations where DynamoDB is the target).


=head2 FullLoadReloaded => Bool

A value that indicates if the table was reloaded (C<true>) or loaded as
part of a new full load operation (C<false>).


=head2 FullLoadRows => Int

The number of rows added during the full load operation.

=head2 ResyncRowsAttempted => Int

Records the total number of mismatched data rows where the system
attempted to apply fixes in the target database.


=head2 ResyncRowsFailed => Int

Records the total number of mismatched data rows where fix attempts
failed in the target database.


=head2 ResyncRowsSucceeded => Int

Records the total number of mismatched data rows where fixes were
successfully applied in the target database.


=head2 ResyncState => Str

Pending E<ndash> The tables are waiting for resync.

=item *

In progress E<ndash> Resync in progress for some records in the table.

time. Time provided in UTC format.

=back



=head2 SchemaName => Str

Valid states: Table does not exist | Before load | Full load | Table
completed | Table cancelled | Table error | Table is being reloaded


=head2 Updates => Int

The number of update actions performed on a table.


=head2 ValidationFailedRecords => Int

The number of records that failed validation.


=head2 ValidationPendingRecords => Int

between the source and target.

=item *

Suspended records E<ndash> Some records in the table couldn't be
validated.

=item *

No primary key E<ndash>The table couldn't be validated because it has
no primary key.

=item *

Table error E<ndash> The table wasn't validated because it's in an
error state and some data wasn't migrated.

=item *

Validated E<ndash> All rows in the table are validated. If the table is
updated, the status can change from Validated.

=item *

Error E<ndash> The table couldn't be validated because of an unexpected

Pending validation E<ndash> The table is waiting validation.

=item *

Preparing table E<ndash> Preparing the table enabled in the migration
task for validation.

=item *

Pending revalidation E<ndash> All rows in the table are pending
validation after the table was updated.

=back



=head2 ValidationStateDetails => Str

Additional details about the state of validation.


=head2 ValidationSuspendedRecords => Int
