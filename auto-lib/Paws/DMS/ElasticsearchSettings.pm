=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::ElasticsearchSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::ElasticsearchSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndpointUri => $value, ..., UseNewMappingType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::ElasticsearchSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndpointUri

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines an OpenSearch endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndpointUri => Str

The endpoint for the OpenSearch cluster. DMS uses HTTPS if a transport
protocol (http/https) is not specified.


=head2 ErrorRetryDuration => Int

The maximum number of seconds for which DMS retries failed API requests
to the OpenSearch cluster.


=head2 FullLoadErrorPercentage => Int

The maximum percentage of records that can fail to be written before a
full load operation stops.

To avoid early failure, this counter is only effective after 1000
records are transferred. OpenSearch also has the concept of error
monitoring during the last 10 minutes of an Observation Window. If
transfer of all records fail in the last 10 minutes, the full load
operation stops.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceAccessRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) used by the service to access the IAM
role. The role must allow the C<iam:PassRole> action.


=head2 UseNewMappingType => Bool

Set this option to C<true> for DMS to migrate documentation using the
documentation type C<_doc>. OpenSearch and an Elasticsearch cluster
only support the _doc documentation type in versions 7. x and later.
The default value is C<false>.
