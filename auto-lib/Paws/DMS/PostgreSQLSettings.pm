=head1 NAME

Paws::DMS::PostgreSQLSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DMS::PostgreSQLSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AfterConnectScript => $value, ..., Username => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DMS::PostgreSQLSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AfterConnectScript

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information that defines a PostgreSQL endpoint.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AfterConnectScript => Str

For use with change data capture (CDC) only, this attribute has DMS
bypass foreign keys and user triggers to reduce the time it takes to
bulk load data.

Example: C<afterConnectScript=SET session_replication_role='replica'>


=head2 AuthenticationMethod => Str

This attribute allows you to specify the authentication method as "iam
auth".


=head2 BabelfishDatabaseName => Str

The Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL database name for the endpoint.


=head2 CaptureDdls => Bool

To capture DDL events, DMS creates various artifacts in the PostgreSQL
database when the task starts. You can later remove these artifacts.

The default value is C<true>.

If this value is set to C<N>, you don't have to create tables or
triggers on the source database.


=head2 DatabaseMode => Str

Specifies the default behavior of the replication's handling of
PostgreSQL- compatible endpoints that require some additional
configuration, such as Babelfish endpoints.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

Database name for the endpoint.


=head2 DdlArtifactsSchema => Str

The schema in which the operational DDL database artifacts are created.

The default value is C<public>.

Example: C<ddlArtifactsSchema=xyzddlschema;>


=head2 DisableUnicodeSourceFilter => Bool

Disables the Unicode source filter with PostgreSQL, for values passed
into the Selection rule filter on Source Endpoint column values. By
default DMS performs source filter comparisons using a Unicode string
which can cause look ups to ignore the indexes in the text columns and
slow down migrations.

Unicode support should only be disabled when using a selection rule
filter is on a text column in the Source database that is indexed.


=head2 ExecuteTimeout => Int

Sets the client statement timeout for the PostgreSQL instance, in
seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.

Example: C<executeTimeout=100;>


=head2 FailTasksOnLobTruncation => Bool

When set to C<true>, this value causes a task to fail if the actual
size of a LOB column is greater than the specified C<LobMaxSize>.

The default value is C<false>.

If task is set to Limited LOB mode and this option is set to true, the
task fails instead of truncating the LOB data.


=head2 HeartbeatEnable => Bool

The write-ahead log (WAL) heartbeat feature mimics a dummy transaction.
By doing this, it prevents idle logical replication slots from holding
onto old WAL logs, which can result in storage full situations on the
source. This heartbeat keeps C<restart_lsn> moving and prevents storage
full scenarios.

The default value is C<false>.


=head2 HeartbeatFrequency => Int

Sets the WAL heartbeat frequency (in minutes).

The default value is 5 minutes.


=head2 HeartbeatSchema => Str

Sets the schema in which the heartbeat artifacts are created.

The default value is C<public>.


=head2 MapBooleanAsBoolean => Bool

When true, lets PostgreSQL migrate the boolean type as boolean. By
default, PostgreSQL migrates booleans as C<varchar(5)>. You must set
this setting on both the source and target endpoints for it to take
effect.

The default value is C<false>.


=head2 MapJsonbAsClob => Bool

When true, DMS migrates JSONB values as CLOB.

The default value is C<false>.


=head2 MapLongVarcharAs => Str

Sets what datatype to map LONG values as.

The default value is C<wstring>.


=head2 MaxFileSize => Int

Specifies the maximum size (in KB) of any .csv file used to transfer
data to PostgreSQL.

The default value is 32,768 KB (32 MB).

Example: C<maxFileSize=512>


=head2 Password => Str

Endpoint connection password.


=head2 PluginName => Str

Specifies the plugin to use to create a replication slot.

The default value is C<pglogical>.


=head2 Port => Int

Endpoint TCP port. The default is 5432.


=head2 SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn => Str

The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that specifies DMS
as the trusted entity and grants the required permissions to access the
value in C<SecretsManagerSecret>. The role must allow the
C<iam:PassRole> action. C<SecretsManagerSecret> has the value of the
Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager secret that allows access to the
PostgreSQL endpoint.

You can specify one of two sets of values for these permissions. You
can specify the values for this setting and C<SecretsManagerSecretId>.
Or you can specify clear-text values for C<UserName>, C<Password>,
C<ServerName>, and C<Port>. You can't specify both. For more
information on creating this C<SecretsManagerSecret> and the
C<SecretsManagerAccessRoleArn> and C<SecretsManagerSecretId> required
to access it, see Using secrets to access Database Migration Service
resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Security.html#security-iam-secretsmanager)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>.


=head2 SecretsManagerSecretId => Str

The full ARN, partial ARN, or friendly name of the
C<SecretsManagerSecret> that contains the PostgreSQL endpoint
connection details.


=head2 ServerName => Str

The host name of the endpoint database.

For an Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance, this is the output of
DescribeDBInstances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBInstances.html),
in the C< Endpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_Endpoint.html).Address>
field.

For an Aurora PostgreSQL instance, this is the output of
DescribeDBClusters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeDBClusters.html),
in the C<Endpoint> field.


=head2 ServiceAccessRoleArn => Str

The IAM role arn you can use to authenticate the connection to your
endpoint. Ensure to include C<iam:PassRole> and C<rds-db:connect>
actions in permission policy.


=head2 SlotName => Str

Sets the name of a previously created logical replication slot for a
change data capture (CDC) load of the PostgreSQL source instance.

When used with the C<CdcStartPosition> request parameter for the DMS
API , this attribute also makes it possible to use native CDC start
points. DMS verifies that the specified logical replication slot exists
before starting the CDC load task. It also verifies that the task was
created with a valid setting of C<CdcStartPosition>. If the specified
slot doesn't exist or the task doesn't have a valid C<CdcStartPosition>
setting, DMS raises an error.

For more information about setting the C<CdcStartPosition> request
parameter, see Determining a CDC native start point
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Task.CDC.html#CHAP_Task.CDC.StartPoint.Native)
in the I<Database Migration Service User Guide>. For more information
about using C<CdcStartPosition>, see CreateReplicationTask
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateReplicationTask.html),
StartReplicationTask
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTask.html),
and ModifyReplicationTask
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationTask.html).


=head2 TrimSpaceInChar => Bool

Use the C<TrimSpaceInChar> source endpoint setting to trim data on CHAR
and NCHAR data types during migration. The default value is C<true>.


=head2 Username => Str

Endpoint connection user name.
