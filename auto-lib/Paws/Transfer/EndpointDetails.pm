=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddressAllocationIds => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddressAllocationIds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
for your file transfer protocol-enabled server. With a VPC endpoint,
you can restrict access to your server and resources only within your
VPC. To control incoming internet traffic, invoke the C<UpdateServer>
API and attach an Elastic IP address to your server's endpoint.

After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using
C<EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT> in your Amazon Web Services account if
your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have
already created servers with C<EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT> in your
Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be
affected. After this date, use C<EndpointType>=C<VPC>.

For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.

It is recommended that you use C<VPC> as the C<EndpointType>. With this
endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three
Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint
and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public
IP address. This is not possible with C<EndpointType> set to
C<VPC_ENDPOINT>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddressAllocationIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic
IP address to your server's endpoint.

An address allocation ID corresponds to the allocation ID of an Elastic
IP address. This value can be retrieved from the C<allocationId> field
from the Amazon EC2 Address
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_Address.html)
data type. One way to retrieve this value is by calling the EC2
DescribeAddresses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html)
API.

This parameter is optional. Set this parameter if you want to make your
VPC endpoint public-facing. For details, see Create an internet-facing
endpoint for your server
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#create-internet-facing-endpoint).

This property can only be set as follows:

=over

=item *

C<EndpointType> must be set to C<VPC>

=item *

The Transfer Family server must be offline.

=item *

You cannot set this parameter for Transfer Family servers that use the
FTP protocol.

=item *

The server must already have C<SubnetIds> populated (C<SubnetIds> and
C<AddressAllocationIds> cannot be updated simultaneously).

=item *

C<AddressAllocationIds> can't contain duplicates, and must be equal in
length to C<SubnetIds>. For example, if you have three subnet IDs, you
must also specify three address allocation IDs.

=item *

Call the C<UpdateServer> API to set or change this parameter.

=back



=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of security groups IDs that are available to attach to your
server's endpoint.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.

You can edit the C<SecurityGroupIds> property in the UpdateServer
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/API_UpdateServer.html)
API only if you are changing the C<EndpointType> from C<PUBLIC> or
C<VPC_ENDPOINT> to C<VPC>. To change security groups associated with
your server's VPC endpoint after creation, use the Amazon EC2
ModifyVpcEndpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyVpcEndpoint.html)
API.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of subnet IDs that are required to host your server endpoint in
your VPC.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.


=head2 VpcEndpointId => Str

The identifier of the VPC endpoint.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to
C<VPC_ENDPOINT>.

For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The VPC identifier of the VPC in which a server's endpoint will be
hosted.

This property can only be set when C<EndpointType> is set to C<VPC>.
