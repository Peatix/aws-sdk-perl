=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::DescribedServer

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DescribedServer object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., WorkflowDetails => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DescribedServer object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the properties of a file transfer protocol-enabled server
that was specified.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Specifies the unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the server.


=head2 As2ServiceManagedEgressIpAddresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of egress IP addresses of this server. These IP addresses are
only relevant for servers that use the AS2 protocol. They are used for
sending asynchronous MDNs.

These IP addresses are assigned automatically when you create an AS2
server. Additionally, if you update an existing server and add the AS2
protocol, static IP addresses are assigned as well.


=head2 Certificate => Str

Specifies the ARN of the Amazon Web ServicesCertificate Manager (ACM)
certificate. Required when C<Protocols> is set to C<FTPS>.


=head2 Domain => Str

Specifies the domain of the storage system that is used for file
transfers. There are two domains available: Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). The
default value is S3.


=head2 EndpointDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::EndpointDetails>

The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured
for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can
make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you
can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to
clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are
automatically assigned to your endpoint.


=head2 EndpointType => Str

Defines the type of endpoint that your server is connected to. If your
server is connected to a VPC endpoint, your server isn't accessible
over the public internet.


=head2 HostKeyFingerprint => Str

Specifies the Base64-encoded SHA256 fingerprint of the server's host
key. This value is equivalent to the output of the C<ssh-keygen -l -f
my-new-server-key> command.


=head2 IdentityProviderDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::IdentityProviderDetails>

Specifies information to call a customer-supplied authentication API.
This field is not populated when the C<IdentityProviderType> of a
server is C<AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE> or C<SERVICE_MANAGED>.


=head2 IdentityProviderType => Str

The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is
C<SERVICE_MANAGED>, which allows you to store and access user
credentials within the Transfer Family service.

Use C<AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE> to provide access to Active Directory
groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft
Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web
Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a
Directory ID by using the C<IdentityProviderDetails> parameter.

Use the C<API_GATEWAY> value to integrate with an identity provider of
your choosing. The C<API_GATEWAY> setting requires you to provide an
Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the
C<IdentityProviderDetails> parameter.

Use the C<AWS_LAMBDA> value to directly use an Lambda function as your
identity provider. If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN
for the Lambda function in the C<Function> parameter for the
C<IdentityProviderDetails> data type.


=head2 LoggingRole => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging
for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS events. When set, you can view user
activity in your CloudWatch logs.


=head2 PostAuthenticationLoginBanner => Str

Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This
string is displayed after the user authenticates.

The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.


=head2 PreAuthenticationLoginBanner => Str

Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This
string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the
following banner displays details about using the system:

C<This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals
using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their
authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system
monitored and recorded by system personnel.>


=head2 ProtocolDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::ProtocolDetails>

The protocol settings that are configured for your server.

=over

=item *

To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the
C<PassiveIp> parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such
as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.

=item *

To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use
the C<SETSTAT> command on a file that you are uploading to an Amazon S3
bucket, use the C<SetStatOption> parameter. To have the Transfer Family
server ignore the C<SETSTAT> command and upload files without needing
to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to
C<ENABLE_NO_OP>. If you set the C<SetStatOption> parameter to
C<ENABLE_NO_OP>, Transfer Family generates a log entry to Amazon
CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a
C<SETSTAT> call.

=item *

To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent,
negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the
C<TlsSessionResumptionMode> parameter.

=item *

C<As2Transports> indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages.
Currently, only HTTP is supported.

=back



=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file
transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The
available protocols are:

=over

=item *

C<SFTP> (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over
SSH

=item *

C<FTPS> (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS
encryption

=item *

C<FTP> (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer

=item *

C<AS2> (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured
business-to-business data

=back

=over

=item *

If you select C<FTPS>, you must choose a certificate stored in
Certificate Manager (ACM) which is used to identify your server when
clients connect to it over FTPS.

=item *

If C<Protocol> includes either C<FTP> or C<FTPS>, then the
C<EndpointType> must be C<VPC> and the C<IdentityProviderType> must be
either C<AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE>, C<AWS_LAMBDA>, or C<API_GATEWAY>.

=item *

If C<Protocol> includes C<FTP>, then C<AddressAllocationIds> cannot be
associated.

=item *

If C<Protocol> is set only to C<SFTP>, the C<EndpointType> can be set
to C<PUBLIC> and the C<IdentityProviderType> can be set any of the
supported identity types: C<SERVICE_MANAGED>, C<AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE>,
C<AWS_LAMBDA>, or C<API_GATEWAY>.

=item *

If C<Protocol> includes C<AS2>, then the C<EndpointType> must be
C<VPC>, and domain must be Amazon S3.

=back



=head2 S3StorageOptions => L<Paws::Transfer::S3StorageOptions>

Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is
optimized. This is disabled by default.

By default, home directory mappings have a C<TYPE> of C<DIRECTORY>. If
you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the
C<HomeDirectoryMapEntry> C<Type> to C<FILE> if you want a mapping to
have a file target.


=head2 SecurityPolicyName => Str

Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.


=head2 ServerId => Str

Specifies the unique system-assigned identifier for a server that you
instantiate.


=head2 State => Str

The condition of the server that was described. A value of C<ONLINE>
indicates that the server can accept jobs and transfer files. A
C<State> value of C<OFFLINE> means that the server cannot perform file
transfer operations.

The states of C<STARTING> and C<STOPPING> indicate that the server is
in an intermediate state, either not fully able to respond, or not
fully offline. The values of C<START_FAILED> or C<STOP_FAILED> can
indicate an error condition.


=head2 StructuredLogDestinations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent.

To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log
group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:

C<arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*>

For example,
C<arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*>

If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can
clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an
empty value for this parameter in an C<update-server> call. For
example:

C<update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0
--structured-log-destinations>


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::Tag>]

Specifies the key-value pairs that you can use to search for and group
servers that were assigned to the server that was described.


=head2 UserCount => Int

Specifies the number of users that are assigned to a server you
specified with the C<ServerId>.


=head2 WorkflowDetails => L<Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetails>

Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution
role that's used for executing the workflow.

In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded
completely, C<WorkflowDetails> can also contain a workflow ID (and
execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial
upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is
still being uploaded.
