Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OnPartialUpload => $value, ..., OnUpload => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OnPartialUpload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for the C<WorkflowDetail> data type. It is used by actions
that trigger a workflow to begin execution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OnPartialUpload => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetail>]

A trigger that starts a workflow if a file is only partially uploaded.
You can attach a workflow to a server that executes whenever there is a
partial upload.

A I<partial upload> occurs when a file is open when the session
disconnects.

C<OnPartialUpload> can contain a maximum of one C<WorkflowDetail>
object.


=head2 OnUpload => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetail>]

A trigger that starts a workflow: the workflow begins to execute after
a file is uploaded.

To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can provide an
empty C<OnUpload> object, as in the following example.

C<aws transfer update-server --server-id s-01234567890abcdef
--workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'>

C<OnUpload> can contain a maximum of one C<WorkflowDetail> object.
