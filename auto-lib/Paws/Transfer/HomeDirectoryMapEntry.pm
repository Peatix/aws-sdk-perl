=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::HomeDirectoryMapEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::HomeDirectoryMapEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Entry => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::HomeDirectoryMapEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Entry

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents an object that contains entries and targets for
C<HomeDirectoryMappings>.

The following is an C<Entry> and C<Target> pair example for C<chroot>.

C<[ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Entry => Str

Represents an entry for C<HomeDirectoryMappings>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Target => Str

Represents the map target that is used in a C<HomeDirectoryMapEntry>.


=head2 Type => Str

Specifies the type of mapping. Set the type to C<FILE> if you want the
mapping to point to a file, or C<DIRECTORY> for the directory to point
to a directory.

By default, home directory mappings have a C<Type> of C<DIRECTORY> when
you create a Transfer Family server. You would need to explicitly set
C<Type> to C<FILE> if you want a mapping to have a file target.
