=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::DescribedConnector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DescribedConnector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessRole => $value, ..., Url => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DescribedConnector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessRole

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the parameters for the connector, as identified by the
C<ConnectorId>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessRole => Str

Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP
protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
of the Identity and Access Management role to use.

B<For AS2 connectors>

With AS2, you can send files by calling C<StartFileTransfer> and
specifying the file paths in the request parameter, C<SendFilePaths>.
We use the fileE<rsquo>s parent directory (for example, for
C<--send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt>, parent directory is
C</bucket/dir/>) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file,
store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final
JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the
C<AccessRole> needs to provide read and write access to the parent
directory of the file location used in the C<StartFileTransfer>
request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the
parent directory of the files that you intend to send with
C<StartFileTransfer>.

If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the
access role requires the C<secretsmanager:GetSecretValue> permission
for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key
instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then
the role also needs the C<kms:Decrypt> permission for that key.

B<For SFTP connectors>

Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the
parent directory of the file location that's used in the
C<StartFileTransfer> request. Additionally, make sure that the role
provides C<secretsmanager:GetSecretValue> permission to Secrets
Manager.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the connector.


=head2 As2Config => L<Paws::Transfer::As2ConnectorConfig>

A structure that contains the parameters for an AS2 connector object.


=head2 ConnectorId => Str

The unique identifier for the connector.


=head2 LoggingRole => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that allows a connector to turn on CloudWatch logging for
Amazon S3 events. When set, you can view connector activity in your
CloudWatch logs.


=head2 SecurityPolicyName => Str

The text name of the security policy for the specified connector.


=head2 ServiceManagedEgressIpAddresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of egress IP addresses of this connector. These IP addresses
are assigned automatically when you create the connector.


=head2 SftpConfig => L<Paws::Transfer::SftpConnectorConfig>

A structure that contains the parameters for an SFTP connector object.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::Tag>]

Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for connectors.


=head2 Url => Str

The URL of the partner's AS2 or SFTP endpoint.
