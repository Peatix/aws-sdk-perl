=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExecutionRole => $value, ..., WorkflowId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::WorkflowDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExecutionRole

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution
role that's used for executing the workflow.

In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded
completely, C<WorkflowDetails> can also contain a workflow ID (and
execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial
upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is
still being uploaded.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExecutionRole => Str

Includes the necessary permissions for S3, EFS, and Lambda operations
that Transfer can assume, so that all workflow steps can operate on the
required resources


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkflowId => Str

A unique identifier for the workflow.
