=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DirectoryListingOptimization => Str

Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is
optimized. This is disabled by default.

By default, home directory mappings have a C<TYPE> of C<DIRECTORY>. If
you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the
C<HomeDirectoryMapEntry> C<Type> to C<FILE> if you want a mapping to
have a file target.
