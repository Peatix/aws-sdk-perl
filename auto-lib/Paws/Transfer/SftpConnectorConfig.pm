=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::SftpConnectorConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::SftpConnectorConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxConcurrentConnections => $value, ..., UserSecretId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::SftpConnectorConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxConcurrentConnections

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details for an SFTP connector object. The connector object
is used for transferring files to and from a partner's SFTP server.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxConcurrentConnections => Int

Specify the number of concurrent connections that your connector
creates to the remote server. The default value is C<5> (this is also
the maximum value allowed).

This parameter specifies the number of active connections that your
connector can establish with the remote server at the same time.
Increasing this value can enhance connector performance when
transferring large file batches by enabling parallel operations.


=head2 TrustedHostKeys => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The public portion of the host key, or keys, that are used to identify
the external server to which you are connecting. You can use the
C<ssh-keyscan> command against the SFTP server to retrieve the
necessary key.

C<TrustedHostKeys> is optional for C<CreateConnector>. If not provided,
you can use C<TestConnection> to retrieve the server host key during
the initial connection attempt, and subsequently update the connector
with the observed host key.

The three standard SSH public key format elements are C<E<lt>key
typeE<gt>>, C<E<lt>body base64E<gt>>, and an optional
C<E<lt>commentE<gt>>, with spaces between each element. Specify only
the C<E<lt>key typeE<gt>> and C<E<lt>body base64E<gt>>: do not enter
the C<E<lt>commentE<gt>> portion of the key.

For the trusted host key, Transfer Family accepts RSA and ECDSA keys.

=over

=item *

For RSA keys, the C<E<lt>key typeE<gt>> string is C<ssh-rsa>.

=item *

For ECDSA keys, the C<E<lt>key typeE<gt>> string is either
C<ecdsa-sha2-nistp256>, C<ecdsa-sha2-nistp384>, or
C<ecdsa-sha2-nistp521>, depending on the size of the key you generated.

=back

Run this command to retrieve the SFTP server host key, where your SFTP
server name is C<ftp.host.com>.

C<ssh-keyscan ftp.host.com>

This prints the public host key to standard output.

C<ftp.host.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza...E<lt>long-string-for-public-key>

Copy and paste this string into the C<TrustedHostKeys> field for the
C<create-connector> command or into the B<Trusted host keys> field in
the console.


=head2 UserSecretId => Str

The identifier for the secret (in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager)
that contains the SFTP user's private key, password, or both. The
identifier must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

=over

=item *

Required when creating an SFTP connector

=item *

Optional when updating an existing SFTP connector
