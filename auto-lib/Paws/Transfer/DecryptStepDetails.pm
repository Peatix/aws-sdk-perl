=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::DecryptStepDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DecryptStepDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationFileLocation => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DecryptStepDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationFileLocation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each step type has its own C<StepDetails> structure.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationFileLocation => L<Paws::Transfer::InputFileLocation>

Specifies the location for the file being decrypted. Use
C<${Transfer:UserName}> or C<${Transfer:UploadDate}> in this field to
parametrize the destination prefix by username or uploaded date.

=over

=item *

Set the value of C<DestinationFileLocation> to C<${Transfer:UserName}>
to decrypt uploaded files to an Amazon S3 bucket that is prefixed with
the name of the Transfer Family user that uploaded the file.

=item *

Set the value of C<DestinationFileLocation> to
C<${Transfer:UploadDate}> to decrypt uploaded files to an Amazon S3
bucket that is prefixed with the date of the upload.

The system resolves C<UploadDate> to a date format of I<YYYY-MM-DD>,
based on the date the file is uploaded in UTC.

=back



=head2 Name => Str

The name of the step, used as an identifier.


=head2 OverwriteExisting => Str

A flag that indicates whether to overwrite an existing file of the same
name. The default is C<FALSE>.

If the workflow is processing a file that has the same name as an
existing file, the behavior is as follows:

=over

=item *

If C<OverwriteExisting> is C<TRUE>, the existing file is replaced with
the file being processed.

=item *

If C<OverwriteExisting> is C<FALSE>, nothing happens, and the workflow
processing stops.

=back



=head2 SourceFileLocation => Str

Specifies which file to use as input to the workflow step: either the
output from the previous step, or the originally uploaded file for the
workflow.

=over

=item *

To use the previous file as the input, enter C<${previous.file}>. In
this case, this workflow step uses the output file from the previous
workflow step as input. This is the default value.

=item *

To use the originally uploaded file location as input for this step,
enter C<${original.file}>.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of encryption used. Currently, this value must be C<PGP>.
