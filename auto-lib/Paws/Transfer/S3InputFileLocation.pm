=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::S3InputFileLocation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::S3InputFileLocation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., Key => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::S3InputFileLocation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the customer input Amazon S3 file location. If it is used
inside C<copyStepDetails.DestinationFileLocation>, it should be the S3
copy destination.

You need to provide the bucket and key. The key can represent either a
path or a file. This is determined by whether or not you end the key
value with the forward slash (/) character. If the final character is
"/", then your file is copied to the folder, and its name does not
change. If, rather, the final character is alphanumeric, your uploaded
file is renamed to the path value. In this case, if a file with that
name already exists, it is overwritten.

For example, if your path is C<shared-files/bob/>, your uploaded files
are copied to the C<shared-files/bob/>, folder. If your path is
C<shared-files/today>, each uploaded file is copied to the
C<shared-files> folder and named C<today>: each upload overwrites the
previous version of the I<bob> file.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Bucket => Str

Specifies the S3 bucket for the customer input file.


=head2 Key => Str

The name assigned to the file when it was created in Amazon S3. You use
the object key to retrieve the object.
