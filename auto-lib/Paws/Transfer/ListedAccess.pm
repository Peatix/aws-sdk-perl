=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::ListedAccess

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::ListedAccess object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExternalId => $value, ..., Role => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::ListedAccess object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExternalId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lists the properties for one or more specified associated accesses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExternalId => Str

A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within
your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access
to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols
using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID
values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.

C<Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "I<YourGroupName>*"}
-Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid>

In that command, replace I<YourGroupName> with the name of your Active
Directory group.

The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of
characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric
characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of
the following characters: =,.@:/-


=head2 HomeDirectory => Str

The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the
server using the client.

A C<HomeDirectory> example is C</bucket_name/home/mydirectory>.

The C<HomeDirectory> parameter is only used if C<HomeDirectoryType> is
set to C<PATH>.


=head2 HomeDirectoryType => Str

The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home
directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to
C<PATH>, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS
path as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it to
C<LOGICAL>, you need to provide mappings in the
C<HomeDirectoryMappings> for how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon
EFS paths visible to your users.

If C<HomeDirectoryType> is C<LOGICAL>, you must provide mappings, using
the C<HomeDirectoryMappings> parameter. If, on the other hand,
C<HomeDirectoryType> is C<PATH>, you provide an absolute path using the
C<HomeDirectory> parameter. You cannot have both C<HomeDirectory> and
C<HomeDirectoryMappings> in your template.


=head2 Role => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket or
Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine
the level of access that you want to provide your users when
transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS
file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust relationship that
allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users'
transfer requests.
