=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::DescribedSecurityPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DescribedSecurityPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Fips => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DescribedSecurityPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Fips

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the properties of a security policy that you specify. For
more information about security policies, see Working with security
policies for servers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/security-policies.html)
or Working with security policies for SFTP connectors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/security-policies-connectors.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Fips => Bool

Specifies whether this policy enables Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS). This parameter applies to both server and connector
security policies.


=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the file transfer protocols that the security policy applies to.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityPolicyName => Str

The text name of the specified security policy.


=head2 SshCiphers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the enabled Secure Shell (SSH) cipher encryption algorithms in
the security policy that is attached to the server or connector. This
parameter applies to both server and connector security policies.


=head2 SshHostKeyAlgorithms => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the host key algorithms for the security policy.

This parameter only applies to security policies for connectors.


=head2 SshKexs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the enabled SSH key exchange (KEX) encryption algorithms in the
security policy that is attached to the server or connector. This
parameter applies to both server and connector security policies.


=head2 SshMacs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the enabled SSH message authentication code (MAC) encryption
algorithms in the security policy that is attached to the server or
connector. This parameter applies to both server and connector security
policies.


=head2 TlsCiphers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists the enabled Transport Layer Security (TLS) cipher encryption
algorithms in the security policy that is attached to the server.

This parameter only applies to security policies for servers.


=head2 Type => Str

The resource type to which the security policy applies, either server
or connector.
