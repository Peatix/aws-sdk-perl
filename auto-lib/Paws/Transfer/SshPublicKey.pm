=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::SshPublicKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::SshPublicKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DateImported => $value, ..., SshPublicKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::SshPublicKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DateImported

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about the public Secure Shell (SSH) key that is
associated with a Transfer Family user for the specific file transfer
protocol-enabled server (as identified by C<ServerId>). The information
returned includes the date the key was imported, the public key
contents, and the public key ID. A user can store more than one SSH
public key associated with their user name on a specific server.

Specifies the date that the public key was added to the Transfer Family
user.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SshPublicKeyBody => Str

=head2 B<REQUIRED> SshPublicKeyId => Str

Specifies the C<SshPublicKeyId> parameter contains the identifier of
the public key.
