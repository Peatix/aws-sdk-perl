=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::As2ConnectorConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::As2ConnectorConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BasicAuthSecretId => $value, ..., SigningAlgorithm => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::As2ConnectorConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BasicAuthSecretId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details for an AS2 connector object. The connector object
is used for AS2 outbound processes, to connect the Transfer Family
customer with the trading partner.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BasicAuthSecretId => Str

Provides Basic authentication support to the AS2 Connectors API. To use
Basic authentication, you must provide the name or Amazon Resource Name
(ARN) of a secret in Secrets Manager.

The default value for this parameter is C<null>, which indicates that
Basic authentication is not enabled for the connector.

If the connector should use Basic authentication, the secret needs to
be in the following format:

C<{ "Username": "user-name", "Password": "user-password" }>

Replace C<user-name> and C<user-password> with the credentials for the
actual user that is being authenticated.

Note the following:

=over

=item *

You are storing these credentials in Secrets Manager, I<not passing
them directly> into this API.

=item *

If you are using the API, SDKs, or CloudFormation to configure your
connector, then you must create the secret before you can enable Basic
authentication. However, if you are using the Amazon Web Services
management console, you can have the system create the secret for you.

=back

If you have previously enabled Basic authentication for a connector,
you can disable it by using the C<UpdateConnector> API call. For
example, if you are using the CLI, you can run the following command to
remove Basic authentication:

C<update-connector --connector-id my-connector-id --as2-config
'BasicAuthSecretId=""'>


=head2 Compression => Str

Specifies whether the AS2 file is compressed.


=head2 EncryptionAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that is used to encrypt the file.

Note the following:

=over

=item *

Do not use the C<DES_EDE3_CBC> algorithm unless you must support a
legacy client that requires it, as it is a weak encryption algorithm.

=item *

You can only specify C<NONE> if the URL for your connector uses HTTPS.
Using HTTPS ensures that no traffic is sent in clear text.

=back



=head2 LocalProfileId => Str

A unique identifier for the AS2 local profile.


=head2 MdnResponse => Str

Used for outbound requests (from an Transfer Family connector to a
partner AS2 server) to determine whether the partner response for
transfers is synchronous or asynchronous. Specify either of the
following values:

=over

=item *

C<SYNC>: The system expects a synchronous MDN response, confirming that
the file was transferred successfully (or not).

=item *

C<NONE>: Specifies that no MDN response is required.

=back



=head2 MdnSigningAlgorithm => Str

The signing algorithm for the MDN response.

If set to DEFAULT (or not set at all), the value for
C<SigningAlgorithm> is used.


=head2 MessageSubject => Str

Used as the C<Subject> HTTP header attribute in AS2 messages that are
being sent with the connector.


=head2 PartnerProfileId => Str

A unique identifier for the partner profile for the connector.


=head2 PreserveContentType => Str

Allows you to use the Amazon S3 C<Content-Type> that is associated with
objects in S3 instead of having the content type mapped based on the
file extension. This parameter is enabled by default when you create an
AS2 connector from the console, but disabled by default when you create
an AS2 connector by calling the API directly.


=head2 SigningAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that is used to sign the AS2 messages sent with the
connector.
