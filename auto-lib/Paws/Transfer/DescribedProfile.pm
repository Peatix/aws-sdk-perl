Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::DescribedProfile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::DescribedProfile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details for a local or partner AS2 profile.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the profile.


=head2 As2Id => Str

The C<As2Id> is the I<AS2-name>, as defined in the RFC 4130
(https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4130). For inbound transfers,
this is the C<AS2-From> header for the AS2 messages sent from the
partner. For outbound connectors, this is the C<AS2-To> header for the
AS2 messages sent to the partner using the C<StartFileTransfer> API
operation. This ID cannot include spaces.


=head2 CertificateIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of identifiers for the imported certificates. You use this
identifier for working with profiles and partner profiles.


=head2 ProfileId => Str

A unique identifier for the local or partner AS2 profile.


=head2 ProfileType => Str

Indicates whether to list only C<LOCAL> type profiles or only
C<PARTNER> type profiles. If not supplied in the request, the command
lists all types of profiles.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Transfer::Tag>]

Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for profiles.
