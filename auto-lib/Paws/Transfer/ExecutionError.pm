=head1 NAME

Paws::Transfer::ExecutionError

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Transfer::ExecutionError object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Message => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Transfer::ExecutionError object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Message

=item *

C<ALREADY_EXISTS>: occurs for a copy step, if the overwrite option is
not selected and a file with the same name already exists in the target
location.

=item *

C<BAD_REQUEST>: a general bad request: for example, a step that
attempts to tag an EFS file returns C<BAD_REQUEST>, as only S3 files
can be tagged.

C<CUSTOM_STEP_FAILED>: occurs when the custom step provided a callback
that indicates failure.

=item *

C<INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR>: a catch-all error that can occur for a
variety of reasons.

C<NOT_FOUND>: occurs when a requested entity, for example a source file
for a copy step, does not exist.

=item *

C<PERMISSION_DENIED>: occurs if your policy does not contain the
correct permissions to complete one or more of the steps in the
workflow.

=item *

C<TIMEOUT>: occurs when the execution times out.

You can set the C<TimeoutSeconds> for a custom step, anywhere from 1
second to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

=item *

C<THROTTLED>: occurs if you exceed the new execution refill rate of one
workflow per second.
