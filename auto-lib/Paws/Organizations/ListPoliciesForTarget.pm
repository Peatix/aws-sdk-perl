=head1 NAME

Paws::Organizations::ListPoliciesForTarget - Arguments for method ListPoliciesForTarget on L<Paws::Organizations>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListPoliciesForTarget on the
L<AWS Organizations|Paws::Organizations> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListPoliciesForTarget.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListPoliciesForTarget.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $organizations = Paws->service('Organizations');
# To retrieve a list policies attached to a root, OU, or account
# The following example shows how to get a list of all service control policies
# (SCPs) of the type specified by the Filter parameter, that are directly
# attached to an account. The returned list does not include policies that apply
# to the account because of inheritance from its location in an OU
# hierarchy:/n/n
    my $ListPoliciesForTargetResponse = $organizations->ListPoliciesForTarget(
      'Filter'   => 'SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY',
      'TargetId' => 444444444444
    );

    # Results:
    my $Policies = $ListPoliciesForTargetResponse->Policies;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Organizations::ListPoliciesForTargetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/organizations/ListPoliciesForTarget>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Filter => Str

The type of policy that you want to include in the returned list. You
must specify one of the following values:

=over

=item *

SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html)

=item *

RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html)

=item *

DECLARATIVE_POLICY_EC2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_declarative.html)

=item *

BACKUP_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_backup.html)

=item *

TAG_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies.html)

=item *

CHATBOT_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot.html)

=item *

AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html)

=back


Valid values are: C<"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY">, C<"RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY">, C<"TAG_POLICY">, C<"BACKUP_POLICY">, C<"AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY">, C<"CHATBOT_POLICY">, C<"DECLARATIVE_POLICY_EC2">

=head2 MaxResults => Int

The total number of results that you want included on each page of the
response. If you do not include this parameter, it defaults to a value
that is specific to the operation. If additional items exist beyond the
maximum you specify, the C<NextToken> response element is present and
has a value (is not null). Include that value as the C<NextToken>
request parameter in the next call to the operation to get the next
part of the results. Note that Organizations might return fewer results
than the maximum even when there are more results available. You should
check C<NextToken> after every operation to ensure that you receive all
of the results.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The parameter for receiving additional results if you receive a
C<NextToken> response in a previous request. A C<NextToken> response
indicates that more output is available. Set this parameter to the
value of the previous call's C<NextToken> response to indicate where
the output should continue from.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetId => Str

The unique identifier (ID) of the root, organizational unit, or account
whose policies you want to list.

The regex pattern (http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for a target ID
string requires one of the following:

=over

=item *

B<Root> - A string that begins with "r-" followed by from 4 to 32
lowercase letters or digits.

=item *

B<Account> - A string that consists of exactly 12 digits.

=item *

B<Organizational unit (OU)> - A string that begins with "ou-" followed
by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits (the ID of the root that
the OU is in). This string is followed by a second "-" dash and from 8
to 32 additional lowercase letters or digits.
