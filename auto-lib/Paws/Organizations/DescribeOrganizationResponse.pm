A structure that contains information about the organization.

The C<AvailablePolicyTypes> part of the response is deprecated, and you
shouldn't use it in your apps. It doesn't include any policy type
supported by Organizations other than SCPs. In the China (Ningxia)
Region, no policy type is included. To determine which policy types are
enabled in your organization, use the C< ListRoots > operation.
