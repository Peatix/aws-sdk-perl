=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VerifiedPermissions::ConfigurationItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CognitoUserPoolConfiguration => $value, ..., OpenIdConnectConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VerifiedPermissions::ConfigurationItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CognitoUserPoolConfiguration

C<"configuration":{"cognitoUserPoolConfiguration":{"userPoolArn":"arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:123456789012:userpool/us-east-1_1a2b3c4d5","clientIds":
["a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0kalbmc"],"groupConfiguration":
{"groupEntityType": "MyCorp::Group"}}}>


=head2 OpenIdConnectConfiguration => L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::OpenIdConnectConfigurationItem>

Contains configuration details of an OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity
provider, or identity source, that Verified Permissions can use to
generate entities from authenticated identities. It specifies the
issuer URL, token type that you want to use, and policy store entity
