This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attributes => $value, ..., Parents => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VerifiedPermissions::EntityItem object:

  $result->Att1->Attributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about an entity that can be referenced in a Cedar
policy.

This data type is used as one of the fields in the EntitiesDefinition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_EntitiesDefinition.html)
structure.

C<{ "identifier": { "entityType": "Photo", "entityId":
"VacationPhoto94.jpg" }, "attributes": {}, "parents": [ { "entityType":
"Album", "entityId": "alice_folder" } ] }>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::EntityAttributes>

A list of attributes for the entity.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Identifier => L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::EntityIdentifier>

The identifier of the entity.


=head2 Parents => ArrayRef[L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::EntityIdentifier>]

The parent entities in the hierarchy that contains the entity. A
principal or resource entity can be defined with at most 99
I<transitive parents> per authorization request.

A transitive parent is an entity in the hierarchy of entities including
all direct parents, and parents of parents. For example, a user can be
a member of 91 groups if one of those groups is a member of eight
groups, for a total of 100: one entity, 91 entity parents, and eight
parents of parents.
