=head1 NAME

Paws::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Static => $value, ..., TemplateLinked => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Static

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the details for a Cedar policy definition. It
includes the policy type, a description, and a policy body. This is a
top level data type used to create a policy.

This data type is used as a request parameter for the CreatePolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_CreatePolicy.html)
operation. This structure must always have either an C<static> or a
C<templateLinked> element.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Static => L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::StaticPolicyDefinition>

A structure that describes a static policy. An static policy doesn't
use a template or allow placeholders for entities.


=head2 TemplateLinked => L<Paws::VerifiedPermissions::TemplateLinkedPolicyDefinition>

A structure that describes a policy that was instantiated from a
template. The template can specify placeholders for C<principal> and
C<resource>. When you use CreatePolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_CreatePolicy.html)
to create a policy from a template, you specify the exact principal and
resource to use for the instantiated policy.
