=head1 NAME

Paws::RedshiftData::SubStatementData

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RedshiftData::SubStatementData object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RedshiftData::SubStatementData object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an SQL statement.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The date and time (UTC) the statement was created.


=head2 Duration => Int

The amount of time in nanoseconds that the statement ran.


=head2 Error => Str

The error message from the cluster if the SQL statement encountered an
error while running.


=head2 HasResultSet => Bool

A value that indicates whether the statement has a result set. The
result set can be empty. The value is true for an empty result set.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The identifier of the SQL statement. This value is a universally unique
identifier (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift Data API. A suffix
indicates the number of the SQL statement. For example,
C<d9b6c0c9-0747-4bf4-b142-e8883122f766:2> has a suffix of C<:2> that
indicates the second SQL statement of a batch query.


=head2 QueryString => Str

The SQL statement text.


=head2 RedshiftQueryId => Int

The SQL statement identifier. This value is a universally unique
identifier (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift Data API.


=head2 ResultRows => Int

Either the number of rows returned from the SQL statement or the number
of rows affected. If result size is greater than zero, the result rows
can be the number of rows affected by SQL statements such as INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE, COPY, and others. A C<-1> indicates the value is null.


=head2 ResultSize => Int

The size in bytes of the returned results. A C<-1> indicates the value
is null.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the SQL statement. An example is the that the SQL
statement finished.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The date and time (UTC) that the statement metadata was last updated.
