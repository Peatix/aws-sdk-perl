=head1 NAME

Paws::GeoPlaces::SearchNearbyFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GeoPlaces::SearchNearbyFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BoundingBox => $value, ..., IncludeFoodTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GeoPlaces::SearchNearbyFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BoundingBox

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SearchNearby structure which contains a set of inclusion/exclusion
properties that results must posses in order to be returned as a
result.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BoundingBox => ArrayRef[Num]

The bounding box enclosing the geometric shape (area or line) that an
individual result covers.

The bounding box formed is defined as a set 4 coordinates: C<[{westward
lng}, {southern lat}, {eastward lng}, {northern lat}]>


=head2 ExcludeBusinessChains => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Business Chains associated with the place.


=head2 ExcludeCategories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Categories of results that results are excluded from.


=head2 ExcludeFoodTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Food types that results are excluded from.


=head2 IncludeBusinessChains => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Business Chains associated with the place.


=head2 IncludeCategories => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Categories of results that results must belong too.


=head2 IncludeCountries => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of countries that all results must be in. Countries are
represented by either their alpha-2 or alpha-3 character codes.


=head2 IncludeFoodTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Food types that results are included from.
