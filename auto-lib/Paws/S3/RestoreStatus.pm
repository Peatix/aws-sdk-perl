=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::RestoreStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::RestoreStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IsRestoreInProgress => $value, ..., RestoreExpiryDate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::RestoreStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IsRestoreInProgress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain
storage classes must be restored before they can be retrieved. For more
information about these storage classes and how to work with archived
objects, see Working with archived objects
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/archived-objects.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory
buckets only support C<EXPRESS_ONEZONE> (the S3 Express One Zone
storage class) in Availability Zones and C<ONEZONE_IA> (the S3 One
Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsRestoreInProgress => Bool

Specifies whether the object is currently being restored. If the object
restoration is in progress, the header returns the value C<TRUE>. For
example:

C<x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="true">

If the object restoration has completed, the header returns the value
C<FALSE>. For example:

C<x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false",
RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z">

If the object hasn't been restored, there is no header response.


=head2 RestoreExpiryDate => Str

Indicates when the restored copy will expire. This value is populated
only if the object has already been restored. For example:

C<x-amz-optional-object-attributes: IsRestoreInProgress="false",
RestoreExpiryDate="2012-12-21T00:00:00.000Z">
