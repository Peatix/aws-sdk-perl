=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::CompletedPart

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::CompletedPart object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChecksumCRC32 => $value, ..., PartNumber => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::CompletedPart object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChecksumCRC32

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details of the parts that were uploaded.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChecksumCRC32 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32> checksum of the part. This checksum
is present if the multipart upload request was created with the
C<CRC32> checksum algorithm. For more information, see Checking object
integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumCRC32C => Str

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32C> checksum of the part. This
checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with
the C<CRC32C> checksum algorithm. For more information, see Checking
object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumCRC64NVME => Str

The Base64 encoded, 64-bit C<CRC64NVME> checksum of the part. This
checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with
the C<CRC64NVME> checksum algorithm to the uploaded object). For more
information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumSHA1 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 160-bit C<SHA1> checksum of the part. This checksum
is present if the multipart upload request was created with the C<SHA1>
checksum algorithm. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumSHA256 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 256-bit C<SHA256> checksum of the part. This
checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with
the C<SHA256> checksum algorithm. For more information, see Checking
object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ETag => Str

Entity tag returned when the part was uploaded.


=head2 PartNumber => Int

Part number that identifies the part. This is a positive integer
between 1 and 10,000.

=item *

B<General purpose buckets> - In C<CompleteMultipartUpload>, when a
additional checksum (including C<x-amz-checksum-crc32>,
C<x-amz-checksum-crc32c>, C<x-amz-checksum-sha1>, or
C<x-amz-checksum-sha256>) is applied to each part, the C<PartNumber>
must start at 1 and the part numbers must be consecutive. Otherwise,
Amazon S3 generates an HTTP C<400 Bad Request> status code and an
C<InvalidPartOrder> error code.

=item *

B<Directory buckets> - In C<CompleteMultipartUpload>, the C<PartNumber>
must start at 1 and the part numbers must be consecutive.
