=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::CopyObjectResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::CopyObjectResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChecksumCRC32 => $value, ..., LastModified => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::CopyObjectResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChecksumCRC32

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for all response elements.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChecksumCRC32 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32> checksum of the object. This
checksum is only present if the object was uploaded with the object.
For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumCRC32C => Str

The Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32C> checksum of the object. This will
only be present if the object was uploaded with the object. For more
information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumCRC64NVME => Str

The Base64 encoded, 64-bit C<CRC64NVME> checksum of the object. This
checksum is present if the object being copied was uploaded with the
C<CRC64NVME> checksum algorithm, or if the object was uploaded without
a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, C<CRC64NVME>, to
the uploaded object). For more information, see Checking object
integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumSHA1 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 160-bit C<SHA1> digest of the object. This will
only be present if the object was uploaded with the object. For more
information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumSHA256 => Str

The Base64 encoded, 256-bit C<SHA256> digest of the object. This will
only be present if the object was uploaded with the object. For more
information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ChecksumType => Str

The checksum type that is used to calculate the objectE<rsquo>s
checksum value. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ETag => Str

Returns the ETag of the new object. The ETag reflects only changes to
the contents of an object, not its metadata.


=head2 LastModified => Str

Creation date of the object.
