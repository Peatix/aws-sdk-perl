=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::Transition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::Transition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Date => $value, ..., StorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::Transition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Date

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies when an object transitions to a specified storage class. For
more information about Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, see
Transitioning Objects Using Amazon S3 Lifecycle
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Date => Str

Indicates when objects are transitioned to the specified storage class.
The date value must be in ISO 8601 format. The time is always midnight
UTC.


=head2 Days => Int

Indicates the number of days after creation when objects are
transitioned to the specified storage class. If the specified storage
class is C<INTELLIGENT_TIERING>, C<GLACIER_IR>, C<GLACIER>, or
C<DEEP_ARCHIVE>, valid values are C<0> or positive integers. If the
specified storage class is C<STANDARD_IA> or C<ONEZONE_IA>, valid
values are positive integers greater than C<30>. Be aware that some
storage classes have a minimum storage duration and that you're charged
for transitioning objects before their minimum storage duration. For
more information, see Constraints and considerations for transitions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html#lifecycle-configuration-constraints)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The storage class to which you want the object to transition.
