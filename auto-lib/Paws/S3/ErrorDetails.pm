=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::ErrorDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::ErrorDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorCode => $value, ..., ErrorMessage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::ErrorDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the C<CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration> request succeeds, but
S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this structure contains the
error code and error message.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorCode => Str

If the C<CreateBucketMetadataTableConfiguration> request succeeds, but
S3 Metadata was unable to create the table, this structure contains the
error code. The possible error codes and error messages are as follows:

=over

=item *

C<AccessDeniedCreatingResources> - You don't have sufficient
permissions to create the required resources. Make sure that you have
C<s3tables:CreateNamespace>, C<s3tables:CreateTable>,
C<s3tables:GetTable> and C<s3tables:PutTablePolicy> permissions, and
then try again. To create a new metadata table, you must delete the
metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a new metadata
configuration.

=item *

C<AccessDeniedWritingToTable> - Unable to write to the metadata table
because of missing resource permissions. To fix the resource policy,
Amazon S3 needs to create a new metadata table. To create a new
metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this
bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

=item *

C<DestinationTableNotFound> - The destination table doesn't exist. To
create a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration
for this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

=item *

C<ServerInternalError> - An internal error has occurred. To create a
new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for this
bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

=item *

C<TableAlreadyExists> - The table that you specified already exists in
the table bucket's namespace. Specify a different table name. To create
a new metadata table, you must delete the metadata configuration for
this bucket, and then create a new metadata configuration.

=item *

C<TableBucketNotFound> - The table bucket that you specified doesn't
exist in this Amazon Web Services Region and account. Create or choose
a different table bucket. To create a new metadata table, you must
delete the metadata configuration for this bucket, and then create a
new metadata configuration.
