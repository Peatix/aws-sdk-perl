=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::ReplicationRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::ReplicationRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteMarkerReplication => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::ReplicationRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteMarkerReplication

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the
replicas.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteMarkerReplication => L<Paws::S3::DeleteMarkerReplication>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destination => L<Paws::S3::Destination>

A container for information about the replication destination and its
configurations including enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3
RTC).


=head2 ExistingObjectReplication => L<Paws::S3::ExistingObjectReplication>

Optional configuration to replicate existing source bucket objects.

This parameter is no longer supported. To replicate existing objects,
see Replicating existing objects with S3 Batch Replication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-batch-replication-batch.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::S3::ReplicationRuleFilter>




=head2 ID => Str

A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.


=head2 Prefix => Str

An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to
which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters.
To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters
(such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more
information, see XML related object key constraints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).


=head2 Priority => Int

The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more
replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects
according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more
rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated
according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number,
the higher the priority.

For more information, see Replication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html) in
the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 SourceSelectionCriteria => L<Paws::S3::SourceSelectionCriteria>

A container that describes additional filters for identifying the
source objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or
disable the replication of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports
only the filter that you can specify for objects created with
server-side encryption using a customer managed key stored in Amazon
Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Specifies whether the rule is enabled.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::S3>
