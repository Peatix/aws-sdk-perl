=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::PartitionedPrefix object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PartitionDateSource => $value, ..., PartitionDateSource => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::PartitionedPrefix object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PartitionDateSource

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon S3 keys for log objects are partitioned in the following format:

C<[DestinationPrefix][SourceAccountId]/[SourceRegion]/[SourceBucket]/[YYYY]/[MM]/[DD]/[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[hh]-[mm]-[ss]-[UniqueString]>

PartitionedPrefix defaults to EventTime delivery when server access
logs are delivered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PartitionDateSource => Str

Specifies the partition date source for the partitioned prefix.
C<PartitionDateSource> can be C<EventTime> or C<DeliveryTime>.

For C<DeliveryTime>, the time in the log file names corresponds to the
delivery time for the log files.

For C<EventTime>, The logs delivered are for a specific day only. The
year, month, and day correspond to the day on which the event occurred,
and the hour, minutes and seconds are set to 00 in the key.
