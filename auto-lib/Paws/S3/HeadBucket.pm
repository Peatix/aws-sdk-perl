=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::HeadBucket - Arguments for method HeadBucket on L<Paws::S3>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method HeadBucket on the
L<Amazon Simple Storage Service|Paws::S3> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method HeadBucket.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to HeadBucket.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $s3 = Paws->service('S3');
    # To determine if bucket exists
    # This operation checks to see if a bucket exists.
    my $HeadBucketOutput = $s3->HeadBucket( 'Bucket' => 'acl1' );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3/HeadBucket>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The bucket name.

B<Directory buckets> - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format C<
I<Bucket-name>.s3express-I<zone-id>.I<region-code>.amazonaws.com>.
Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket
names must follow the format C< I<bucket-base-name>--I<zone-id>--x-s3>
(for example, C< I<amzn-s3-demo-bucket>--I<usw2-az1>--x-s3>). For
information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
naming rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

B<Access points> - When you use this action with an access point for
general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must
provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using
the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point
hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
I<AccessPointName>-I<AccountId>.s3-accesspoint.I<Region>.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access
points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

B<Object Lambda access points> - When you use this API operation with
an Object Lambda access point, provide the alias of the Object Lambda
access point in place of the bucket name. If the Object Lambda access
point alias in a request is not valid, the error code
C<InvalidAccessPointAliasError> is returned. For more information about
C<InvalidAccessPointAliasError>, see List of Error Codes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html#ErrorCodeList).

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

B<S3 on Outposts> - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
hostname takes the form C<
I<AccessPointName>-I<AccountId>.I<outpostID>.s3-outposts.I<Region>.amazonaws.com>.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket
must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For
more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts?
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ExpectedBucketOwner => Str

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request
fails with the HTTP status code C<403 Forbidden> (access denied).
