=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::ObjectVersion

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::ObjectVersion object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChecksumAlgorithm => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::ObjectVersion object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChecksumAlgorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The version of an object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.


=head2 ChecksumType => Str

The checksum type that is used to calculate the objectE<rsquo>s
checksum value. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ETag => Str

The entity tag is an MD5 hash of that version of the object.


=head2 IsLatest => Bool

Specifies whether the object is (true) or is not (false) the latest
version of an object.


=head2 Key => Str

The object key.


=head2 LastModified => Str

Date and time when the object was last modified.


=head2 Owner => L<Paws::S3::Owner>

Specifies the owner of the object.


=head2 RestoreStatus => L<Paws::S3::RestoreStatus>

Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain
storage classes must be restored before they can be retrieved. For more
information about these storage classes and how to work with archived
objects, see Working with archived objects
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/archived-objects.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 Size => Int

Size in bytes of the object.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The class of storage used to store the object.


=head2 VersionId => Str

Version ID of an object.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::S3>
