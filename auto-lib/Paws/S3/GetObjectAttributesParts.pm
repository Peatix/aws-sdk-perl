=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::GetObjectAttributesParts

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::GetObjectAttributesParts object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IsTruncated => $value, ..., TotalPartsCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::GetObjectAttributesParts object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IsTruncated

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of parts associated with a multipart upload.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsTruncated => Bool

Indicates whether the returned list of parts is truncated. A value of
C<true> indicates that the list was truncated. A list can be truncated
if the number of parts exceeds the limit returned in the C<MaxParts>
element.


=head2 MaxParts => Int

The maximum number of parts allowed in the response.


=head2 NextPartNumberMarker => Int

When a list is truncated, this element specifies the last part in the
list, as well as the value to use for the C<PartNumberMarker> request
parameter in a subsequent request.


=head2 PartNumberMarker => Int

The marker for the current part.


=head2 Parts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3::ObjectPart>]

A container for elements related to a particular part. A response can
contain zero or more C<Parts> elements.

=over

=item *

B<General purpose buckets> - For C<GetObjectAttributes>, if a
additional checksum (including C<x-amz-checksum-crc32>,
C<x-amz-checksum-crc32c>, C<x-amz-checksum-sha1>, or
C<x-amz-checksum-sha256>) isn't applied to the object specified in the
request, the response doesn't return C<Part>.

=item *

B<Directory buckets> - For C<GetObjectAttributes>, no matter whether a
additional checksum is applied to the object specified in the request,
the response returns C<Part>.

=back



=head2 TotalPartsCount => Int

The total number of parts.
