Paws::S3::PutBucketOwnershipControls - Arguments for method PutBucketOwnershipControls on L<Paws::S3>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutBucketOwnershipControls on the
L<Amazon Simple Storage Service|Paws::S3> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutBucketOwnershipControls.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutBucketOwnershipControls.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $s3 = Paws->service('S3');
    $s3->PutBucketOwnershipControls(
      Bucket            => 'MyBucketName',
      OwnershipControls => {
        Rules => [
          {
            ObjectOwnership => 'BucketOwnerPreferred'
            ,  # values: BucketOwnerPreferred, ObjectWriter, BucketOwnerEnforced

          },
          ...
        ],

      },
      ContentMD5          => 'MyContentMD5',    # OPTIONAL
      ExpectedBucketOwner => 'MyAccountId',     # OPTIONAL
    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
