=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::LifecycleRuleFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::LifecycleRuleFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { And => $value, ..., Tag => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::LifecycleRuleFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->And

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Filter> is used to identify objects that a Lifecycle Rule applies
to. A C<Filter> can have exactly one of C<Prefix>, C<Tag>,
C<ObjectSizeGreaterThan>, C<ObjectSizeLessThan>, or C<And> specified.
If the C<Filter> element is left empty, the Lifecycle Rule applies to
all objects in the bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 And => L<Paws::S3::LifecycleRuleAndOperator>




=head2 ObjectSizeGreaterThan => Int

Minimum object size to which the rule applies.


=head2 ObjectSizeLessThan => Int

Maximum object size to which the rule applies.


=head2 Prefix => Str

Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters
(such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more
information, see XML related object key constraints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).


=head2 Tag => L<Paws::S3::Tag>

This tag must exist in the object's tag set in order for the rule to
apply.

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not
supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::S3>
