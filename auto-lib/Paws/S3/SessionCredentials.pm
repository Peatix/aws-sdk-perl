=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::SessionCredentials

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::SessionCredentials object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessKeyId => $value, ..., SessionToken => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::SessionCredentials object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The established temporary security credentials of the session.

B<Directory buckets> - These session credentials are only supported for
the authentication and authorization of Zonal endpoint API operations
on directory buckets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AccessKeyId => Str

A unique identifier that's associated with a secret access key. The
access key ID and the secret access key are used together to sign
programmatic Amazon Web Services requests cryptographically.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Expiration => Str

Temporary security credentials expire after a specified interval. After
temporary credentials expire, any calls that you make with those
credentials will fail. So you must generate a new set of temporary
credentials. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed
beyond the original specified interval.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecretAccessKey => Str

A key that's used with the access key ID to cryptographically sign
programmatic Amazon Web Services requests. Signing a request identifies
the sender and prevents the request from being altered.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SessionToken => Str

A part of the temporary security credentials. The session token is used
to validate the temporary security credentials.
