=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::Object

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::Object object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChecksumAlgorithm => $value, ..., StorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::Object object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChecksumAlgorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object consists of data and its descriptive metadata.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.


=head2 ChecksumType => Str

The checksum type that is used to calculate the objectE<rsquo>s
checksum value. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 ETag => Str

The entity tag is a hash of the object. The ETag reflects changes only
to the contents of an object, not its metadata. The ETag may or may not
be an MD5 digest of the object data. Whether or not it is depends on
how the object was created and how it is encrypted as described below:

=over

=item *

Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or
through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted
by SSE-S3 or plaintext, have ETags that are an MD5 digest of their
object data.

=item *

Objects created by the PUT Object, POST Object, or Copy operation, or
through the Amazon Web Services Management Console, and are encrypted
by SSE-C or SSE-KMS, have ETags that are not an MD5 digest of their
object data.

=item *

If an object is created by either the Multipart Upload or Part Copy
operation, the ETag is not an MD5 digest, regardless of the method of
encryption. If an object is larger than 16 MB, the Amazon Web Services
Management Console will upload or copy that object as a Multipart
Upload, and therefore the ETag will not be an MD5 digest.

=back

B<Directory buckets> - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 Key => Str

The name that you assign to an object. You use the object key to
retrieve the object.


=head2 LastModified => Str

Creation date of the object.


=head2 Owner => L<Paws::S3::Owner>

The owner of the object

B<Directory buckets> - The bucket owner is returned as the object
owner.


=head2 RestoreStatus => L<Paws::S3::RestoreStatus>

Specifies the restoration status of an object. Objects in certain
storage classes must be restored before they can be retrieved. For more
information about these storage classes and how to work with archived
objects, see Working with archived objects
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/archived-objects.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets. Directory
buckets only support C<EXPRESS_ONEZONE> (the S3 Express One Zone
storage class) in Availability Zones and C<ONEZONE_IA> (the S3 One
Zone-Infrequent Access storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.


=head2 Size => Int

Size in bytes of the object


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The class of storage used to store the object.

B<Directory buckets> - Directory buckets only support
C<EXPRESS_ONEZONE> (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in
Availability Zones and C<ONEZONE_IA> (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.
