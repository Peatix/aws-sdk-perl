=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::ObjectIdentifier

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::ObjectIdentifier object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ETag => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::ObjectIdentifier object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ETag

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object Identifier is unique value to identify objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ETag => Str

An entity tag (ETag) is an identifier assigned by a web server to a
specific version of a resource found at a URL. This header field makes

Entity tags (ETags) for S3 Express One Zone are random alphanumeric
strings unique to the object.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

Key name of the object.

Replacement must be made for object keys containing special characters
(such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more
information, see XML related object key constraints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints).


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

If present, the objects are deleted only if its modification times
matches the provided C<Timestamp>.

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.


=head2 Size => Int

If present, the objects are deleted only if its size matches the
provided size in bytes.

This functionality is only supported for directory buckets.


=head2 VersionId => Str
