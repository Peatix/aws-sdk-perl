=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReplicaKmsKeyID => $value, ..., ReplicaKmsKeyID => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReplicaKmsKeyID

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies encryption-related information for an Amazon S3 bucket that
is a destination for replicated objects.

If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a
fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then
KMS resolves the key within the requesterE<rsquo>s account. This
behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that
belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReplicaKmsKeyID => Str

Specifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed Amazon
Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management
Service (KMS) for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to
encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric encryption
KMS keys. For more information, see Asymmetric keys in Amazon Web
Services KMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide>.
