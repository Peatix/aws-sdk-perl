=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::NoncurrentVersionExpiration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::NoncurrentVersionExpiration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NewerNoncurrentVersions => $value, ..., NoncurrentDays => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::NoncurrentVersionExpiration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->NewerNoncurrentVersions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire. Upon expiration,
Amazon S3 permanently deletes the noncurrent object versions. You set
this lifecycle configuration action on a bucket that has versioning
enabled (or suspended) to request that Amazon S3 delete noncurrent
object versions at a specific period in the object's lifetime.

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not
supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 NewerNoncurrentVersions => Int

Specifies how many noncurrent versions Amazon S3 will retain. You can
specify up to 100 noncurrent versions to retain. Amazon S3 will
permanently delete any additional noncurrent versions beyond the
specified number to retain. For more information about noncurrent
versions, see Lifecycle configuration elements
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/intro-lifecycle-rules.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not
supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.


=head2 NoncurrentDays => Int

Specifies the number of days an object is noncurrent before Amazon S3
can perform the associated action. The value must be a non-zero
positive integer. For information about the noncurrent days
calculations, see How Amazon S3 Calculates When an Object Became
Noncurrent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/intro-lifecycle-rules.html#non-current-days-calculations)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

This parameter applies to general purpose buckets only. It is not
supported for directory bucket lifecycle configurations.
