=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::MultipartUpload

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::MultipartUpload object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChecksumAlgorithm => $value, ..., UploadId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::MultipartUpload object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChecksumAlgorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container for the C<MultipartUpload> for the Amazon S3 object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that was used to create a checksum of the object.


=head2 ChecksumType => Str

The checksum type that is used to calculate the objectE<rsquo>s
checksum value. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 Initiated => Str

Date and time at which the multipart upload was initiated.


=head2 Initiator => L<Paws::S3::Initiator>

Identifies who initiated the multipart upload.


=head2 Key => Str

=head2 Owner => L<Paws::S3::Owner>

Specifies the owner of the object that is part of the multipart upload.

B<Directory buckets> - The bucket owner is returned as the object owner
for all the objects.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The class of storage used to store the object.

B<Directory buckets> - Directory buckets only support
C<EXPRESS_ONEZONE> (the S3 Express One Zone storage class) in
Availability Zones and C<ONEZONE_IA> (the S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
storage class) in Dedicated Local Zones.


=head2 UploadId => Str
