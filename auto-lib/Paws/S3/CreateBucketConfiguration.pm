=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::CreateBucketConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::CreateBucketConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., LocationConstraint => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::CreateBucketConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration information for the bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Bucket => L<Paws::S3::BucketInfo>

Specifies the information about the bucket that will be created.

This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.


=head2 Location => L<Paws::S3::LocationInfo>

Specifies the location where the bucket will be created.

B<Directory buckets > - The location type is Availability Zone or Local
Zone. To use the Local Zone location type, your account must be enabled
for Dedicated Local Zones. Otherwise, you get an HTTP C<403 Forbidden>
error with the error code C<AccessDenied>. To learn more, see Enable
accounts for Dedicated Local Zones
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/opt-in-directory-bucket-lz.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

This functionality is only supported by directory buckets.


=head2 LocationConstraint => Str

Specifies the Region where the bucket will be created. You might choose
a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory
requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably
find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region.

If you don't specify a Region, the bucket is created in the US East (N.
Virginia) Region (us-east-1) by default. Configurations using the value
C<EU> will create a bucket in C<eu-west-1>.

For a list of the valid values for all of the Amazon Web Services
Regions, see Regions and Endpoints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region).

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
