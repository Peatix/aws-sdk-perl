=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::UploadPart - Arguments for method UploadPart on L<Paws::S3>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UploadPart on the
L<Amazon Simple Storage Service|Paws::S3> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UploadPart.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UploadPart.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $s3 = Paws->service('S3');
    # To upload a part
    # The following example uploads part 1 of a multipart upload. The example
    # specifies a file name for the part data. The Upload ID is same that is
    # returned by the initiate multipart upload.
    my $UploadPartOutput = $s3->UploadPart(
      'Body'       => 'fileToUpload',
      'Bucket'     => 'examplebucket',
      'Key'        => 'examplelargeobject',
      'PartNumber' => 1,
      'UploadId'   =>
'xadcOB_7YPBOJuoFiQ9cz4P3Pe6FIZwO4f7wN93uHsNBEw97pl5eNwzExg0LAT2dUN91cOmrEQHDsP3WA60CEg--'
    );

    # Results:
    my $ETag = $UploadPartOutput->ETag;

    # Returns a L<Paws::S3::UploadPartOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3/UploadPart>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Body => Str

Object data.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

B<Directory buckets> - When you use this operation with a directory
bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format C<
I<Bucket-name>.s3express-I<zone-id>.I<region-code>.amazonaws.com>.
Path-style requests are not supported. Directory bucket names must be
unique in the chosen Zone (Availability Zone or Local Zone). Bucket
names must follow the format C< I<bucket-base-name>--I<zone-id>--x-s3>
(for example, C< I<amzn-s3-demo-bucket>--I<usw2-az1>--x-s3>). For
information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket
naming rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-bucket-naming-rules.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

B<Access points> - When you use this action with an access point for
general purpose buckets, you must provide the alias of the access point
in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When you
use this action with an access point for directory buckets, you must
provide the access point name in place of the bucket name. When using
the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point
hostname. The access point hostname takes the form
I<AccessPointName>-I<AccountId>.s3-accesspoint.I<Region>.amazonaws.com.
When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web
Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket
name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access
points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-access-points.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.

B<S3 on Outposts> - When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, you
must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts
hostname takes the form C<
I<AccessPointName>-I<AccountId>.I<outpostID>.s3-outposts.I<Region>.amazonaws.com>.
When you use this action with S3 on Outposts, the destination bucket
must be the Outposts access point ARN or the access point alias. For
more information about S3 on Outposts, see What is S3 on Outposts?
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => Str

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the object when
you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
there must be a corresponding C<x-amz-checksum> or C<x-amz-trailer>
header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP
status code C<400 Bad Request>. For more information, see Checking
object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
C<ChecksumAlgorithm> parameter.

This checksum algorithm must be the same for all parts and it match the
checksum value supplied in the C<CreateMultipartUpload> request.

Valid values are: C<"CRC32">, C<"CRC32C">, C<"SHA1">, C<"SHA256">, C<"CRC64NVME">

=head2 ChecksumCRC32 => Str

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32> checksum of the object.
For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ChecksumCRC32C => Str

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 32-bit C<CRC32C> checksum of the object.
For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ChecksumCRC64NVME => Str

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 64-bit C<CRC64NVME> checksum of the part.
For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ChecksumSHA1 => Str

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 160-bit C<SHA1> digest of the object. For
more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ChecksumSHA256 => Str

This header can be used as a data integrity check to verify that the
data received is the same data that was originally sent. This header
specifies the Base64 encoded, 256-bit C<SHA256> digest of the object.
For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.



=head2 ContentLength => Int

Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of
the body cannot be determined automatically.



=head2 ContentMD5 => Str

The Base64 encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data. This parameter
is auto-populated when using the command from the CLI. This parameter
is required if object lock parameters are specified.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.



=head2 ExpectedBucketOwner => Str

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request
fails with the HTTP status code C<403 Forbidden> (access denied).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PartNumber => Int

Part number of part being uploaded. This is a positive integer between
1 and 10,000.



=head2 RequestPayer => Str



Valid values are: C<"requester">

=head2 SSECustomerAlgorithm => Str

Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example,
AES256).

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.



=head2 SSECustomerKey => Str

Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in
encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is
discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be
appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the
C<x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header>. This must be
the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload
request.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.



=head2 SSECustomerKeyMD5 => Str

Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC
1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to
ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.

This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> UploadId => Str

Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being
uploaded.
