=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::PutBucketWebsite - Arguments for method PutBucketWebsite on L<Paws::S3>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutBucketWebsite on the
L<Amazon Simple Storage Service|Paws::S3> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutBucketWebsite.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutBucketWebsite.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $s3 = Paws->service('S3');
    # Set website configuration on a bucket
    # The following example adds website configuration to a bucket.
    $s3->PutBucketWebsite(
      'Bucket'               => 'examplebucket',
      'ContentMD5'           => '',
      'WebsiteConfiguration' => {
        'ErrorDocument' => {
          'Key' => 'error.html'
        },
        'IndexDocument' => {
          'Suffix' => 'index.html'
        }
      }
    );


Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3/PutBucketWebsite>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The bucket name.



=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => Str

Indicates the algorithm used to create the checksum for the request
when you use the SDK. This header will not provide any additional
functionality if you don't use the SDK. When you send this header,
there must be a corresponding C<x-amz-checksum> or C<x-amz-trailer>
header sent. Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP
status code C<400 Bad Request>. For more information, see Checking
object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.

If you provide an individual checksum, Amazon S3 ignores any provided
C<ChecksumAlgorithm> parameter.

Valid values are: C<"CRC32">, C<"CRC32C">, C<"SHA1">, C<"SHA256">, C<"CRC64NVME">

=head2 ContentMD5 => Str

The Base64 encoded 128-bit C<MD5> digest of the data. You must use this
header as a message integrity check to verify that the request body was
not corrupted in transit. For more information, see RFC 1864
(http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1864.txt).

For requests made using the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
(CLI) or Amazon Web Services SDKs, this field is calculated
automatically.



=head2 ExpectedBucketOwner => Str

The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you
provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request
fails with the HTTP status code C<403 Forbidden> (access denied).



=head2 B<REQUIRED> WebsiteConfiguration => L<Paws::S3::WebsiteConfiguration>

Container for the request.
