=head1 NAME

Paws::S3::FilterRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3::FilterRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3::FilterRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the Amazon S3 object key name to filter on. An object key
name is the name assigned to an object in your Amazon S3 bucket. You
specify whether to filter on the suffix or prefix of the object key
name. A prefix is a specific string of characters at the beginning of
an object key name, which you can use to organize objects. For example,
you can start the key names of related objects with a prefix, such as
C<2023-> or C<engineering/>. Then, you can use C<FilterRule> to find
objects in a bucket with key names that have the same prefix. A suffix
is similar to a prefix, but it is at the end of the object key name
instead of at the beginning.
