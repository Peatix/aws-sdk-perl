=head1 NAME

Paws::MQ::LdapServerMetadataOutput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MQ::LdapServerMetadataOutput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Hosts => $value, ..., UserSearchSubtree => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MQ::LdapServerMetadataOutput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Hosts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Optional. The metadata of the LDAP server used to authenticate and
authorize connections to the broker.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Hosts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the location of the LDAP server such as Directory Service for
Microsoft Active Directory. Optional failover server.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleBase => Str

The distinguished name of the node in the directory information tree
(DIT) to search for roles or groups. For example, ou=group, ou=corp,
dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.


=head2 RoleName => Str

Specifies the LDAP attribute that identifies the group name attribute
in the object returned from the group membership query.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleSearchMatching => Str

The LDAP search filter used to find roles within the roleBase. The
distinguished name of the user matched by userSearchMatching is
substituted into the {0} placeholder in the search filter. The client's
username is substituted into the {1} placeholder. For example, if you
set this option to (member=uid={1})for the user janedoe, the search
filter becomes (member=uid=janedoe) after string substitution. It
matches all role entries that have a member attribute equal to
uid=janedoe under the subtree selected by the roleBase.


=head2 RoleSearchSubtree => Bool

The directory search scope for the role. If set to true, scope is to
search the entire subtree.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceAccountUsername => Str

Service account username. A service account is an account in your LDAP
server that has access to initiate a connection. For example,
cn=admin,dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UserBase => Str

Select a particular subtree of the directory information tree (DIT) to
search for user entries. The subtree is specified by a DN, which
specifies the base node of the subtree. For example, by setting this
option to ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com, the search for
user entries is restricted to the subtree beneath ou=Users, ou=corp,
dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.


=head2 UserRoleName => Str

Specifies the name of the LDAP attribute for the user group membership.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UserSearchMatching => Str

The LDAP search filter used to find users within the userBase. The
client's username is substituted into the {0} placeholder in the search
filter. For example, if this option is set to (uid={0}) and the
received username is janedoe, the search filter becomes (uid=janedoe)
after string substitution. It will result in matching an entry like
uid=janedoe, ou=Users,ou=corp, dc=corp, dc=example, dc=com.


=head2 UserSearchSubtree => Bool

The directory search scope for the user. If set to true, scope is to
search the entire subtree.
