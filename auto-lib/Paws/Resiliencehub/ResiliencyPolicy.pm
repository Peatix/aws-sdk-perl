=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., Tier => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines a resiliency policy.

Resilience Hub allows you to provide a value of zero for C<rtoInSecs>
and C<rpoInSecs> of your resiliency policy. But, while assessing your
application, the lowest possible assessment result is near zero. Hence,
if you provide value zero for C<rtoInSecs> and C<rpoInSecs>, the
estimated workload RTO and estimated workload RPO result will be near
zero and the B<Compliance status> for your application will be set to
B<Policy breached>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

Date and time when the resiliency policy was created.


=head2 DataLocationConstraint => Str

Specifies a high-level geographical location constraint for where your
resilience policy data can be stored.


=head2 EstimatedCostTier => Str

Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.


=head2 Policy => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::DisruptionPolicy>

The resiliency policy.


=head2 PolicyArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format for
this ARN is:
arn:C<partition>:resiliencehub:C<region>:C<account>:resiliency-policy/C<policy-id>.
For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference> guide.


=head2 PolicyDescription => Str

Description of the resiliency policy.


=head2 PolicyName => Str

The name of the policy


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::TagMap>

Tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you assign to an
Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value pair.


=head2 Tier => Str

The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest severity
(C<MissionCritical>) to lowest (C<NonCritical>).
