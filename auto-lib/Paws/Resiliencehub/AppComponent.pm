=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::AppComponent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::AppComponent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalInfo => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::AppComponent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalInfo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines an Application Component.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalInfo => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::AdditionalInfoMap>

Additional configuration parameters for an Resilience Hub application.
If you want to implement C<additionalInfo> through the Resilience Hub
console rather than using an API call, see Configure the application
configuration parameters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resilience-hub/latest/userguide/app-config-param.html).

Currently, this parameter accepts a key-value mapping (in a string
format) of only one failover region and one associated account.

Key: C<"failover-regions">

Value: C<"[{"region":"E<lt>REGIONE<gt>",
"accounts":[{"id":"E<lt>ACCOUNT_IDE<gt>"}]}]">


=head2 Id => Str

Identifier of the Application Component.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str
