=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::App

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::App object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppArn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::App object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines an Resilience Hub application.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resilience Hub application. The
format for this ARN is:
arn:C<partition>:resiliencehub:C<region>:C<account>:app/C<app-id>. For
more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference> guide.


=head2 AssessmentSchedule => Str

Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.


=head2 AwsApplicationArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Resource Groups group that is integrated
with an AppRegistry application. For more information about ARNs, see
Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference> guide.


=head2 ComplianceStatus => Str

Current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

Date and time when the application was created.


=head2 Description => Str

Optional description for an application.


=head2 DriftStatus => Str

Indicates if compliance drifts (deviations) were detected while running
an assessment for your application.


=head2 EventSubscriptions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Resiliencehub::EventSubscription>]

The list of events you would like to subscribe and get notification
for. Currently, Resilience Hub supports notifications only for B<Drift
detected> and B<Scheduled assessment failure> events.


=head2 LastAppComplianceEvaluationTime => Str

Date and time the most recent compliance evaluation.


=head2 LastDriftEvaluationTime => Str

Indicates the last time that a drift was evaluated.


=head2 LastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime => Str

Date and time the most recent resiliency score evaluation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

Name for the application.


=head2 PermissionModel => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::PermissionModel>

Defines the roles and credentials that Resilience Hub would use while
creating the application, importing its resources, and running an
assessment.


=head2 PolicyArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format for
this ARN is:
arn:C<partition>:resiliencehub:C<region>:C<account>:resiliency-policy/C<policy-id>.
For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference> guide.


=head2 ResiliencyScore => Num

Current resiliency score for the application.


=head2 RpoInSecs => Int

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) in seconds.


=head2 RtoInSecs => Int

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) in seconds.


=head2 Status => Str

Status of the application.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::TagMap>

Tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you assign to an
Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value pair.
