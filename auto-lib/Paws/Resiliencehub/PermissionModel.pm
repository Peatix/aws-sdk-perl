=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::PermissionModel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::PermissionModel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrossAccountRoleArns => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::PermissionModel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrossAccountRoleArns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the roles and credentials that Resilience Hub would use while
creating the application, importing its resources, and running an
assessment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrossAccountRoleArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Defines a list of role Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to be used in other
accounts. These ARNs are used for querying purposes while importing
resources and assessing your application.

=over

=item *

These ARNs are required only when your resources are in other accounts
and you have different role name in these accounts. Else, the invoker
role name will be used in the other accounts.

=item *

These roles must have a trust policy with C<iam:AssumeRole> permission
to the invoker role in the primary account.

=back



=head2 InvokerRoleName => Str

Existing Amazon Web Services IAM role name in the primary Amazon Web
Services account that will be assumed by Resilience Hub Service
Principle to obtain a read-only access to your application resources
while running an assessment.

If your IAM role includes a path, you must include the path in the
C<invokerRoleName> parameter. For example, if your IAM role's ARN is
C<arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/my-path/role-name>, you should pass
C<my-path/role-name>.

=over

=item *

You must have C<iam:passRole> permission for this role while creating
or updating the application.

=item *

Currently, C<invokerRoleName> accepts only C<[A-Za-z0-9_+=,.@-]>
characters.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

Defines how Resilience Hub scans your resources. It can scan for the
resources by using a pre-existing role in your Amazon Web Services
account, or by using the credentials of the current IAM user.
