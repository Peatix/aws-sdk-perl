=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::ComplianceDrift

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::ComplianceDrift object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActualReferenceId => $value, ..., ExpectedValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::ComplianceDrift object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActualReferenceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates the compliance drifts (recovery time objective (RTO) and
recovery point objective (RPO)) that were detected for an assessed
entity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActualReferenceId => Str

Assessment identifier that is associated with this drift item.


=head2 ActualValue => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::AssessmentCompliance>

Actual compliance value of the entity.


=head2 AppId => Str

Identifier of your application.


=head2 AppVersion => Str

Published version of your application on which drift was detected.


=head2 DiffType => Str

Difference type between actual and expected recovery point objective
(RPO) and recovery time objective (RTO) values. Currently, Resilience
Hub supports only C<NotEqual> difference type.


=head2 DriftType => Str

The type of drift detected. Currently, Resilience Hub supports only
B<ApplicationCompliance> drift type.


=head2 EntityId => Str

Identifier of an entity in which drift was detected. For compliance
drift, the entity ID can be either application ID or the AppComponent
ID.


=head2 EntityType => Str

The type of entity in which drift was detected. For compliance drifts,
Resilience Hub supports C<AWS::ResilienceHub::AppComponent> and
C<AWS::ResilienceHub::Application>.


=head2 ExpectedReferenceId => Str

Assessment identifier of a previous assessment of the same application
version. Resilience Hub uses the previous assessment (associated with
the reference identifier) to compare the compliance with the current
assessment to identify drifts.


=head2 ExpectedValue => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::AssessmentCompliance>

The expected compliance value of an entity.
