=head1 NAME

Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyScore

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyScore object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComponentScore => $value, ..., Score => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Resiliencehub::ResiliencyScore object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComponentScore

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The overall resiliency score, returned as an object that includes the
disruption score and outage score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComponentScore => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::ScoringComponentResiliencyScores>

The score generated by Resilience Hub for the scoring component after
running an assessment.

For example, if the C<score> is 25 points, it indicates the overall
score of your application generated by Resilience Hub after running an
assessment.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DisruptionScore => L<Paws::Resiliencehub::DisruptionResiliencyScore>

The disruption score for a valid key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Score => Num

The outage score for a valid key.
