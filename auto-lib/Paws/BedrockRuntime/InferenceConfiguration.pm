=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockRuntime::InferenceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockRuntime::InferenceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxTokens => $value, ..., TopP => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockRuntime::InferenceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxTokens

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Base inference parameters to pass to a model in a call to Converse
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html)
or ConverseStream
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStream.html).
For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

If you need to pass additional parameters that the model supports, use
the C<additionalModelRequestFields> request field in the call to
C<Converse> or C<ConverseStream>. For more information, see Model
parameters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxTokens => Int

The maximum number of tokens to allow in the generated response. The
default value is the maximum allowed value for the model that you are
using. For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation
models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).


=head2 StopSequences => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a sequence of characters
that causes the model to stop generating the response.


=head2 Temperature => Num

The likelihood of the model selecting higher-probability options while
generating a response. A lower value makes the model more likely to
choose higher-probability options, while a higher value makes the model
more likely to choose lower-probability options.

The default value is the default value for the model that you are
using. For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation
models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).


=head2 TopP => Num

The percentage of most-likely candidates that the model considers for
the next token. For example, if you choose a value of 0.8 for C<topP>,
the model selects from the top 80% of the probability distribution of
tokens that could be next in the sequence.

The default value is the default value for the model that you are
using. For more information, see Inference parameters for foundation
models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).
