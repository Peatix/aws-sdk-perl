=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockRuntime::ReasoningContentBlockDelta

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockRuntime::ReasoningContentBlockDelta object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RedactedContent => $value, ..., Text => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockRuntime::ReasoningContentBlockDelta object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RedactedContent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains content regarding the reasoning that is carried out by the
model with respect to the content in the content block. Reasoning
refers to a Chain of Thought (CoT) that the model generates to enhance
the accuracy of its final response.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RedactedContent => Str

The content in the reasoning that was encrypted by the model provider
for safety reasons. The encryption doesn't affect the quality of
responses.


=head2 Signature => Str

A token that verifies that the reasoning text was generated by the
model. If you pass a reasoning block back to the API in a multi-turn
conversation, include the text and its signature unmodified.


=head2 Text => Str

The reasoning that the model used to return the output.
