=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetHub::CreateApplication - Arguments for method CreateApplication on L<Paws::IoTFleetHub>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateApplication on the
L<AWS IoT Fleet Hub|Paws::IoTFleetHub> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateApplication.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateApplication.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.fleethub.iot = Paws->service('IoTFleetHub');
    my $CreateApplicationResponse = $api . fleethub . iot->CreateApplication(
      ApplicationName        => 'MyName',
      RoleArn                => 'MyArn',
      ApplicationDescription => 'MyDescription',           # OPTIONAL
      ClientToken            => 'MyClientRequestToken',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags                   => {
        'MyTagKey' =>
          'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: min: 1, max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $ApplicationArn = $CreateApplicationResponse->ApplicationArn;
    my $ApplicationId  = $CreateApplicationResponse->ApplicationId;

    # Returns a L<Paws::IoTFleetHub::CreateApplicationResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
