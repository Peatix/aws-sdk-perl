=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FallbackResult => Str

Specifies the fallback behavior (whether the message is allowed or
denied) if the handler does not return a valid response, encounters an
error, or times out. (For the timeout period, see Service Quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/service-quotas.html).)
If allowed, the message is delivered with returned content to all users
connected to the room. If denied, the message is not delivered to any
user. Default: C<ALLOW>.


=head2 Uri => Str

Identifier of the message review handler. Currently this must be an ARN
of a lambda function.
