=head1 NAME

Paws::M2::GdgAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::M2::GdgAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Limit => $value, ..., RollDisposition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::M2::GdgAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Limit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The required attributes for a generation data group data set. A
generation data set is one of a collection of successive, historically
related, catalogued data sets that together are known as a generation
data group (GDG). Use this structure when you want to import a GDG. For
more information on GDG, see Generation data sets
(https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=guide-generation-data-sets).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Limit => Int

The maximum number of generation data sets, up to 255, in a GDG.


=head2 RollDisposition => Str

The disposition of the data set in the catalog.
