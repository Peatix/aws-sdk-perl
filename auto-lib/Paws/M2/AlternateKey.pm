=head1 NAME

Paws::M2::AlternateKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::M2::AlternateKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowDuplicates => $value, ..., Offset => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::M2::AlternateKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowDuplicates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines an alternate key. This value is optional. A legacy data set
might not have any alternate key defined but if those alternate keys
definitions exist, provide them, as some applications will make use of
them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowDuplicates => Bool

Indicates whether the alternate key values are supposed to be unique
for the given data set.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Length => Int

A strictly positive integer value representing the length of the
alternate key.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the alternate key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Offset => Int

A positive integer value representing the offset to mark the start of
the alternate key part in the record byte array.
