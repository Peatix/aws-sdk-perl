=head1 NAME

Paws::M2::VsamDetailAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::M2::VsamDetailAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlternateKeys => $value, ..., RecordFormat => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::M2::VsamDetailAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlternateKeys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The attributes of a VSAM type data set.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlternateKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::M2::AlternateKey>]

The alternate key definitions, if any. A legacy dataset might not have
any alternate key defined, but if those alternate keys definitions
exist, provide them as some applications will make use of them.


=head2 CacheAtStartup => Bool

If set to True, enforces loading the data set into cache before
itE<rsquo>s used by the application.


=head2 Compressed => Bool

Indicates whether indexes for this dataset are stored as compressed
values. If you have a large data set (typically E<gt> 100 Mb), consider
setting this flag to True.


=head2 Encoding => Str

The character set used by the data set. Can be ASCII, EBCDIC, or
unknown.


=head2 PrimaryKey => L<Paws::M2::PrimaryKey>

The primary key of the data set.


=head2 RecordFormat => Str

The record format of the data set.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::M2>
