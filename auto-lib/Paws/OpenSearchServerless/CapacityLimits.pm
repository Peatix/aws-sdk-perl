This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::OpenSearchServerless::CapacityLimits object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxIndexingCapacityInOCU => $value, ..., MaxSearchCapacityInOCU => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::OpenSearchServerless::CapacityLimits object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxIndexingCapacityInOCU

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The maximum capacity limits for all OpenSearch Serverless collections,
in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs). These limits are used to scale your
collections based on the current workload. For more information, see
