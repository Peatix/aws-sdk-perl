=head1 NAME

Paws::Drs::ReplicationConfigurationReplicatedDisk

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Drs::ReplicationConfigurationReplicatedDisk object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeviceName => $value, ..., Throughput => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Drs::ReplicationConfigurationReplicatedDisk object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeviceName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of a disk of the Source Server to be replicated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeviceName => Str

The name of the device.


=head2 Iops => Int

The requested number of I/O operations per second (IOPS).


=head2 IsBootDisk => Bool

Whether to boot from this disk or not.


=head2 OptimizedStagingDiskType => Str

The Staging Disk EBS volume type to be used during replication when
C<stagingDiskType> is set to Auto. This is a read-only field.


=head2 StagingDiskType => Str

The Staging Disk EBS volume type to be used during replication.


=head2 Throughput => Int

The throughput to use for the EBS volume in MiB/s. This parameter is
valid only for gp3 volumes.
