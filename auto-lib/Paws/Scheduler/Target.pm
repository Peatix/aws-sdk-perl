=head1 NAME

Paws::Scheduler::Target

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Scheduler::Target object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., SqsParameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Scheduler::Target object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The schedule's target. EventBridge Scheduler supports templated target
that invoke common API operations, as well as universal targets that
you can customize to invoke over 6,000 API operations across more than
270 services. You can only specify one templated or universal target
for a schedule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target.


=head2 DeadLetterConfig => L<Paws::Scheduler::DeadLetterConfig>

An object that contains information about an Amazon SQS queue that
EventBridge Scheduler uses as a dead-letter queue for your schedule. If
specified, EventBridge Scheduler delivers failed events that could not
be successfully delivered to a target to the queue.


=head2 EcsParameters => L<Paws::Scheduler::EcsParameters>

The templated target type for the Amazon ECS C<RunTask>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html)
API operation.


=head2 EventBridgeParameters => L<Paws::Scheduler::EventBridgeParameters>

The templated target type for the EventBridge C<PutEvents>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutEvents.html)
API operation.


=head2 Input => Str

The text, or well-formed JSON, passed to the target. If you are
configuring a templated Lambda, AWS Step Functions, or Amazon
EventBridge target, the input must be a well-formed JSON. For all other
target types, a JSON is not required. If you do not specify anything
for this field, EventBridge Scheduler delivers a default notification
to the target.


=head2 KinesisParameters => L<Paws::Scheduler::KinesisParameters>

The templated target type for the Amazon Kinesis C<PutRecord> API
operation.


=head2 RetryPolicy => L<Paws::Scheduler::RetryPolicy>

A C<RetryPolicy> object that includes information about the retry
policy settings, including the maximum age of an event, and the maximum
number of times EventBridge Scheduler will try to deliver the event to
a target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that EventBridge
Scheduler will use for this target when the schedule is invoked.


=head2 SageMakerPipelineParameters => L<Paws::Scheduler::SageMakerPipelineParameters>

The templated target type for the Amazon SageMaker
C<StartPipelineExecution>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_StartPipelineExecution.html)
API operation.


=head2 SqsParameters => L<Paws::Scheduler::SqsParameters>

The templated target type for the Amazon SQS C<SendMessage>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SendMessage.html)
API operation. Contains the message group ID to use when the target is
a FIFO queue. If you specify an Amazon SQS FIFO queue as a target, the
queue must have content-based deduplication enabled. For more
information, see Using the Amazon SQS message deduplication ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagededuplicationid-property.html)
in the I<Amazon SQS Developer Guide>.
