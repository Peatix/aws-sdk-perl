=head1 NAME

Paws::SSMIncidents::CreateReplicationSet - Arguments for method CreateReplicationSet on L<Paws::SSMIncidents>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateReplicationSet on the
L<AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager|Paws::SSMIncidents> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateReplicationSet.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateReplicationSet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ssm-incidents = Paws->service('SSMIncidents');
    my $CreateReplicationSetOutput = $ssm -incidents->CreateReplicationSet(
      Regions => {
        'MyRegionName' => {
          SseKmsKeyId => 'MySseKmsKey',    # max: 2048; OPTIONAL
        },    # key: max: 20
      },
      ClientToken => 'MyClientToken',    # OPTIONAL
      Tags        => {
        'MyTagKey' => 'MyTagValue',    # key: min: 1, max: 128, value: max: 256
      },    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Arn = $CreateReplicationSetOutput->Arn;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SSMIncidents::CreateReplicationSetOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
