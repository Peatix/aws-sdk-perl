=head1 NAME

Paws::SSMIncidents::IncidentTemplate

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSMIncidents::IncidentTemplate object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DedupeString => $value, ..., Title => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSMIncidents::IncidentTemplate object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DedupeString

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Basic details used in creating a response plan. The response plan is
then used to create an incident record.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DedupeString => Str

The string Incident Manager uses to prevent the same root cause from
creating multiple incidents in the same account.

A deduplication string is a term or phrase the system uses to check for
duplicate incidents. If you specify a deduplication string, Incident
Manager searches for open incidents that contain the same string in the
C<dedupeString> field when it creates the incident. If a duplicate is
detected, Incident Manager deduplicates the newer incident into the
existing incident.

By default, Incident Manager automatically deduplicates multiple
incidents created by the same Amazon CloudWatch alarm or Amazon
EventBridge event. You don't have to enter your own deduplication
string to prevent duplication for these resource types.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Impact => Int

The impact of the incident on your customers and applications.

B<Supported impact codes>

=head2 IncidentTags => L<Paws::SSMIncidents::TagMap>

Tags to assign to the template. When the C<StartIncident> API action is
called, Incident Manager assigns the tags specified in the template to
the incident.


=head2 NotificationTargets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSMIncidents::NotificationTargetItem>]

The Amazon SNS targets that are notified when updates are made to an
incident.


=head2 Summary => Str

The summary of the incident. The summary is a brief synopsis of what
occurred, what's currently happening, and context.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Title => Str

The title of the incident.
