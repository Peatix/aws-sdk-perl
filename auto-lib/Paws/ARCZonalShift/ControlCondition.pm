=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::ControlCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::ControlCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmIdentifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::ControlCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmIdentifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A control condition is an alarm that you specify for a practice run.
When you configure practice runs with zonal autoshift for a resource,
you specify Amazon CloudWatch alarms, which you create in CloudWatch to
use with the practice run. The alarms that you specify are an I<outcome
alarm>, to monitor application health during practice runs and,
optionally, a I<blocking alarm>, to block practice runs from starting
or to interrupt a practice run in progress.

Control condition alarms do not apply for autoshifts.

For more information, see Considerations when you configure zonal
autoshift
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.considerations.html)
in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AlarmIdentifier => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you
specify as a control condition for a practice run.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of alarm specified for a practice run. You can only specify
Amazon CloudWatch alarms for practice runs, so the only valid value is
C<CLOUDWATCH>.
