=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::PracticeRunConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::PracticeRunConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BlockedDates => $value, ..., OutcomeAlarms => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::PracticeRunConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BlockedDates

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A practice run configuration for a resource includes the Amazon
CloudWatch alarms that you've specified for a practice run, as well as
any blocked dates or blocked windows for the practice run. When a
resource has a practice run configuration, ARC shifts traffic for the
resource weekly for practice runs.

Practice runs are required for zonal autoshift. The zonal shifts that
ARC starts for practice runs help you to ensure that shifting away
traffic from an Availability Zone during an autoshift is safe for your
application.

You can update or delete a practice run configuration. Before you
delete a practice run configuration, you must disable zonal autoshift
for the resource. A practice run configuration is required when zonal
autoshift is enabled.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BlockedDates => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of one or more dates that you can specify when Amazon Web
Services does not start practice runs for a resource.

Specify blocked dates, in UTC, in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD>, separated
by spaces.


=head2 BlockedWindows => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of one or more windows of days and times that you can block
ARC from starting practice runs for a resource.

Specify the blocked windows in UTC, using the format
C<DAY:HH:MM-DAY:HH:MM>, separated by spaces. For example,
C<MON:18:30-MON:19:30 TUE:18:30-TUE:19:30>.


=head2 BlockingAlarms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ARCZonalShift::ControlCondition>]

The I<blocking alarm> for practice runs is an optional alarm that you
can specify that blocks practice runs when the alarm is in an C<ALARM>
state.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutcomeAlarms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ARCZonalShift::ControlCondition>]

The I<outcome alarm> for practice runs is an alarm that you specify
that ends a practice run when the alarm is in an C<ALARM> state.
