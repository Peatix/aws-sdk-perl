=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::ManagedResourceSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::ManagedResourceSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppliedWeights => $value, ..., ZonalShifts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::ManagedResourceSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppliedWeights

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex structure for a managed resource in an Amazon Web Services
account with information about zonal shifts and autoshifts.

A managed resource is a load balancer that has been registered with ARC
by Elastic Load Balancing. You can start a zonal shift in ARC for a
managed resource to temporarily move traffic for the resource away from
an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region. You can also
configure zonal autoshift for a managed resource.

At this time, managed resources are Network Load Balancers and
Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned off.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AppliedWeights => L<Paws::ARCZonalShift::AppliedWeights>

A collection of key-value pairs that indicate whether resources are
active in Availability Zones or not. The key name is the Availability
Zone where the resource is deployed. The value is 1 or 0.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the managed resource.


=head2 Autoshifts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ARCZonalShift::AutoshiftInResource>]

An array of the autoshifts that have been completed for a resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AvailabilityZones => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Availability Zones that a resource is deployed in.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the managed resource.


=head2 PracticeRunStatus => Str

This status tracks whether a practice run configuration exists for a
resource. When you configure a practice run for a resource so that a
practice run configuration exists, ARC sets this value to C<ENABLED>.
If a you have not configured a practice run for the resource, or delete
a practice run configuration, ARC sets the value to C<DISABLED>.

ARC updates this status; you can't set a practice run status to
C<ENABLED> or C<DISABLED>.


=head2 ZonalAutoshiftStatus => Str

The status of autoshift for a resource. When you configure zonal
autoshift for a resource, you can set the value of the status to
C<ENABLED> or C<DISABLED>.


=head2 ZonalShifts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftInResource>]

An array of the zonal shifts for a resource.
