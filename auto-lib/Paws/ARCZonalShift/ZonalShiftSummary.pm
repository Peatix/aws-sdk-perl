=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwayFrom => $value, ..., ZonalShiftId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwayFrom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lists information about zonal shifts in Amazon Route 53 Application
Recovery Controller, including zonal shifts that you start yourself and
zonal shifts that ARC starts on your behalf for practice runs with
zonal autoshift.

Zonal shifts are temporary, including customer-initiated zonal shifts
and the zonal autoshift practice run zonal shifts that ARC starts
weekly, on your behalf. A zonal shift that a customer starts can be
active for up to three days (72 hours). A practice run zonal shift has
a 30 minute duration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AwayFrom => Str

The Availability Zone (for example, C<use1-az1>) that traffic is moved
away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal
shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead
moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Comment => Str

A comment that you enter about the zonal shift. Only the latest comment
is retained; no comment history is maintained. That is, a new comment
overwrites any existing comment string.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExpiryTime => Str

The expiry time (expiration time) for a customer-initiated zonal shift.
A zonal shift is temporary and must be set to expire when you start the
zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire in a maximum
of three days (72 hours). However, you can update a zonal shift to set
a new expiration at any time.

When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be
active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). You can
cancel a zonal shift when you're ready to restore traffic to the
Availability Zone, or just wait for it to expire. Or you can update the
zonal shift to specify another length of time to expire in.


=head2 PracticeRunOutcome => Str

The outcome, or end state, of a practice run. The following values can
be returned:

=over

=item *

B<PENDING:> Outcome value when the practice run is in progress.

=item *

B<SUCCEEDED:> Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the
practice run configuration does not go into an C<ALARM> state during
the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
completed.

=item *

B<INTERRUPTED:> Outcome value when the practice run did not run for the
expected 30 minutes or there was another problem with the practice run
that created an inconclusive outcome.

=item *

B<FAILED:> Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the
practice run configuration goes into an C<ALARM> state during the
practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
completed.

=back

For more information about practice run outcomes, see Considerations
when you configure zonal autoshift
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.configure.html)
in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the resource to include in a zonal shift. The
identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load
Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
turned off.


=head2 ShiftType => Str

Defines the zonal shift type.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartTime => Str

The time (UTC) when the zonal shift starts.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

A status for a zonal shift.

The C<Status> for a zonal shift can have one of the following values:

=over

=item *

B<ACTIVE:> The zonal shift has been started and active.

=item *

B<EXPIRED:> The zonal shift has expired (the expiry time was exceeded).

=item *

B<CANCELED:> The zonal shift was canceled.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ZonalShiftId => Str

The identifier of a zonal shift.
