=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftInResource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftInResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppliedStatus => $value, ..., ZonalShiftId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::ZonalShiftInResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppliedStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex structure that lists the zonal shifts for a managed resource
and their statuses for the resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppliedStatus => Str

The C<appliedStatus> field specifies which application traffic shift is
in effect for a resource when there is more than one active traffic
shift. There can be more than one application traffic shift in progress
at the same time - that is, practice run zonal shifts,
customer-initiated zonal shifts, or an autoshift. The C<appliedStatus>
field for a shift that is in progress for a resource can have one of
two values: C<APPLIED> or C<NOT_APPLIED>. The zonal shift or autoshift
that is currently in effect for the resource has an C<appliedStatus>
set to C<APPLIED>.

The overall principle for precedence is that zonal shifts that you
start as a customer take precedence autoshifts, which take precedence
over practice runs. That is, customer-initiated zonal shifts E<gt>
autoshifts E<gt> practice run zonal shifts.

For more information, see How zonal autoshift and practice runs work
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.how-it-works.html)
in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AwayFrom => Str

The Availability Zone (for example, C<use1-az1>) that traffic is moved
away from for a resource when you start a zonal shift. Until the zonal
shift expires or you cancel it, traffic for the resource is instead
moved to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Comment => Str

A comment that you enter for a customer-initiated zonal shift. Only the
latest comment is retained; no comment history is maintained. That is,
a new comment overwrites any existing comment string.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExpiryTime => Str

The expiry time (expiration time) for a customer-initiated zonal shift.
A zonal shift is temporary and must be set to expire when you start the
zonal shift. You can initially set a zonal shift to expire in a maximum
of three days (72 hours). However, you can update a zonal shift to set
a new expiration at any time.

When you start a zonal shift, you specify how long you want it to be
active, which ARC converts to an expiry time (expiration time). You can
cancel a zonal shift when you're ready to restore traffic to the
Availability Zone, or just wait for it to expire. Or you can update the
zonal shift to specify another length of time to expire in.


=head2 PracticeRunOutcome => Str

The outcome, or end state, returned for a practice run. The following
values can be returned:

=over

=item *

B<PENDING:> Outcome value when a practice run is in progress.

=item *

B<SUCCEEDED:> Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the
practice run configuration does not go into an C<ALARM> state during
the practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
completed the expected 30 minute zonal shift.

=item *

B<INTERRUPTED:> Outcome value when the practice run was stopped before
the expected 30 minute zonal shift duration, or there was another
problem with the practice run that created an inconclusive outcome.

=item *

B<FAILED:> Outcome value when the outcome alarm specified for the
practice run configuration goes into an C<ALARM> state during the
practice run, and the practice run was not interrupted before it
completed.

=back

For more information about practice run outcomes, see Considerations
when you configure zonal autoshift
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/arc-zonal-autoshift.configure.html)
in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the resource to include in a zonal shift. The
identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the resource.

At this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load
Balancers and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing
turned off.


=head2 ShiftType => Str

Defines the zonal shift type.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartTime => Str

The time (UTC) when the zonal shift starts.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ZonalShiftId => Str

The identifier of a zonal shift.
