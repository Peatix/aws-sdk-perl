=head1 NAME

Paws::ARCZonalShift::AutoshiftSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ARCZonalShift::AutoshiftSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AwayFrom => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ARCZonalShift::AutoshiftSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AwayFrom

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an autoshift. Amazon Web Services starts an autoshift
to temporarily move traffic for a resource away from an Availability
Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region when Amazon Web Services
determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that could
potentially affect customers. You can configure zonal autoshift in ARC
for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services account in a Region.
Supported Amazon Web Services resources are automatically registered
with ARC.

Autoshifts are temporary. When the Availability Zone recovers, Amazon
Web Services ends the autoshift, and traffic for the resource is no
longer directed to the other Availability Zones in the Region.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AwayFrom => Str

The Availability Zone (for example, C<use1-az1>) that traffic is
shifted away from for a resource when Amazon Web Services starts an
autoshift. Until the autoshift ends, traffic for the resource is
instead directed to other Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services
Region. An autoshift can end for a resource, for example, when Amazon
Web Services ends the autoshift for the Availability Zone or when you
disable zonal autoshift for the resource.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The time (in UTC) when the autoshift ended.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartTime => Str

The time (in UTC) when the autoshift started.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status for an autoshift.
