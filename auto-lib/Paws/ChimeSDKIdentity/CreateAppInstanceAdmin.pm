L<Amazon Chime SDK Identity|Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity> service. Use the attributes of this class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $identity-chime = Paws->service('ChimeSDKIdentity');
    my $CreateAppInstanceAdminResponse =
      $identity -chime->CreateAppInstanceAdmin(
      AppInstanceAdminArn => 'MyChimeArn',
      AppInstanceArn      => 'MyChimeArn',

      );

    # Results:
    my $AppInstanceAdmin = $CreateAppInstanceAdminResponse->AppInstanceAdmin;
    my $AppInstanceArn   = $CreateAppInstanceAdminResponse->AppInstanceArn;

   # Returns a L<Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::CreateAppInstanceAdminResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
