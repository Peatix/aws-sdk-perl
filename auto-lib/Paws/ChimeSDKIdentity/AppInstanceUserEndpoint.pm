=head1 NAME

Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::AppInstanceUserEndpoint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::AppInstanceUserEndpoint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowMessages => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::AppInstanceUserEndpoint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowMessages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An endpoint under an Amazon Chime C<AppInstanceUser> that receives
messages for a user. For push notifications, the endpoint is a mobile
device used to receive mobile push notifications for a user.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowMessages => Str

Boolean that controls whether the C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> is opted
in to receive messages. C<ALL> indicates the endpoint will receive all
messages. C<NONE> indicates the endpoint will receive no messages.


=head2 AppInstanceUserArn => Str

The ARN of the C<AppInstanceUser>.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The time at which an C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> was created.


=head2 EndpointAttributes => L<Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::EndpointAttributes>

The attributes of an C<Endpoint>.


=head2 EndpointId => Str

The unique identifier of the C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint>.


=head2 EndpointState => L<Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::EndpointState>

A read-only field that represents the state of an
C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint>. Supported values:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE>: The C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> is active and able to receive
messages. When C<ACTIVE>, the C<EndpointStatusReason> remains empty.

=item *

C<INACTIVE>: The C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> is inactive and can't
receive message. When C<INACTIVE>, the corresponding reason will be
conveyed through C<EndpointStatusReason>.

=item *

C<INVALID_DEVICE_TOKEN> indicates that an C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> is
C<INACTIVE> due to invalid device token

=item *

C<INVALID_PINPOINT_ARN> indicates that an C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> is
C<INACTIVE> due to an invalid pinpoint ARN that was input through the
C<ResourceArn> field.

=head2 LastUpdatedTimestamp => Str

The time at which an C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint> was last updated.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint>.


=head2 ResourceArn => Str

The ARN of the resource to which the endpoint belongs.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of the C<AppInstanceUserEndpoint>.
