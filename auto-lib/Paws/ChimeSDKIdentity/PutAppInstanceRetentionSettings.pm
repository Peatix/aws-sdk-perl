=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $identity-chime = Paws->service('ChimeSDKIdentity');
    my $PutAppInstanceRetentionSettingsResponse =
      $identity -chime->PutAppInstanceRetentionSettings(
      AppInstanceArn               => 'MyChimeArn',
      AppInstanceRetentionSettings => {
        ChannelRetentionSettings => {
          RetentionDays => 1,    # min: 1, max: 5475; OPTIONAL
        },    # OPTIONAL
      },

      );

    # Results:
    my $AppInstanceRetentionSettings =
      $PutAppInstanceRetentionSettingsResponse->AppInstanceRetentionSettings;
    my $InitiateDeletionTimestamp =
      $PutAppInstanceRetentionSettingsResponse->InitiateDeletionTimestamp;

# Returns a L<Paws::ChimeSDKIdentity::PutAppInstanceRetentionSettingsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
