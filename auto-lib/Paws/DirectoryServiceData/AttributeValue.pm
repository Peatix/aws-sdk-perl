=head1 NAME

Paws::DirectoryServiceData::AttributeValue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DirectoryServiceData::AttributeValue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BOOL => $value, ..., SS => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DirectoryServiceData::AttributeValue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BOOL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data type for an attribute. Each attribute value is described as a
name-value pair. The name is the AD schema name, and the value is the
data itself. For a list of supported attributes, see Directory Service
Data Attributes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_data_attributes.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BOOL => Bool

Indicates that the attribute type value is a boolean. For example:

C<"BOOL": true>


=head2 N => Int

Indicates that the attribute type value is a number. For example:

C<"N": "16">


=head2 S => Str

Indicates that the attribute type value is a string. For example:

C<"S": "S Group">


=head2 SS => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates that the attribute type value is a string set. For example:

C<"SS":
["sample_service_class/host.sample.com:1234/sample_service_name_1",
"sample_service_class/host.sample.com:1234/sample_service_name_2"]>
