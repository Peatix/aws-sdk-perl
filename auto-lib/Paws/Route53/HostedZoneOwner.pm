Paws::Route53::HostedZoneOwner

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53::HostedZoneOwner object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OwningAccount => $value, ..., OwningService => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53::HostedZoneOwner object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OwningAccount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that identifies a hosted zone that a specified Amazon
VPC is associated with and the owner of the hosted zone. If there is a
value for C<OwningAccount>, there is no value for C<OwningService>, and
vice versa.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OwningAccount => Str

If the hosted zone was created by an Amazon Web Services account, or
was created by an Amazon Web Services service that creates hosted zones
using the current account, C<OwningAccount> contains the account ID of
that account. For example, when you use Cloud Map to create a hosted
zone, Cloud Map creates the hosted zone using the current Amazon Web
Services account.


=head2 OwningService => Str

If an Amazon Web Services service uses its own account to create a
hosted zone and associate the specified VPC with that hosted zone,
C<OwningService> contains an abbreviation that identifies the service.
For example, if Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) created a
hosted zone and associated a VPC with the hosted zone, the value of
C<OwningService> is C<efs.amazonaws.com>.
