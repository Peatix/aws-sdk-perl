=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53::GeoProximityLocation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53::GeoProximityLocation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AWSRegion => $value, ..., LocalZoneGroup => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53::GeoProximityLocation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AWSRegion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

(Resource record sets only): A complex type that lets you specify where
your resources are located. Only one of C<LocalZoneGroup>,
C<Coordinates>, or C<Amazon Web ServicesRegion> is allowed per request
at a time.

For more information about geoproximity routing, see Geoproximity
routing
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-policy-geoproximity.html)
in the I<Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AWSRegion => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region the resource you are directing DNS
traffic to, is in.


=head2 Bias => Int

The bias increases or decreases the size of the geographic region from
which Route 53 routes traffic to a resource.

To use C<Bias> to change the size of the geographic region, specify the
applicable value for the bias:

=over

=item *

To expand the size of the geographic region from which Route 53 routes
traffic to a resource, specify a positive integer from 1 to 99 for the
bias. Route 53 shrinks the size of adjacent regions.

=item *

To shrink the size of the geographic region from which Route 53 routes
traffic to a resource, specify a negative bias of -1 to -99. Route 53
expands the size of adjacent regions.

=back



=head2 Coordinates => L<Paws::Route53::Coordinates>

Contains the longitude and latitude for a geographic region.


=head2 LocalZoneGroup => Str

Specifies an Amazon Web Services Local Zone Group.

A local Zone Group is usually the Local Zone code without the ending
character. For example, if the Local Zone is C<us-east-1-bue-1a> the
Local Zone Group is C<us-east-1-bue-1>.

You can identify the Local Zones Group for a specific Local Zone by
using the describe-availability-zones
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-availability-zones.html)
CLI command:

This command returns: C<"GroupName": "us-west-2-den-1">, specifying
that the Local Zone C<us-west-2-den-1a> belongs to the Local Zone Group
C<us-west-2-den-1>.
