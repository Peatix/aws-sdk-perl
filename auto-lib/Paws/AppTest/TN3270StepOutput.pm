As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppTest::TN3270StepOutput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataSetDetails => $value, ..., ScriptOutputLocation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppTest::TN3270StepOutput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataSetDetails
