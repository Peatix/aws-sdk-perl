=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteRunConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteRunConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ParallelRun => $value, ..., SelectedTestList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteRunConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ParallelRun

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gets suite run configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ParallelRun => Bool

TRUE if multiple test suites run in parallel.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryDevice => L<Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::DeviceUnderTest>

Sets the primary device for the test suite run. This requires a thing
ARN or a certificate ARN.


=head2 SelectedTestList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Sets test case list.



=head1 SEE ALSO
