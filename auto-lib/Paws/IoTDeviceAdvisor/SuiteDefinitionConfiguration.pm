=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteDefinitionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteDefinitionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DevicePermissionRoleArn => $value, ..., SuiteDefinitionName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::SuiteDefinitionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DevicePermissionRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gets the suite definition configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DevicePermissionRoleArn => Str

Gets the device permission ARN. This is a required parameter.


=head2 Devices => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTDeviceAdvisor::DeviceUnderTest>]

Gets the devices configured.


=head2 IntendedForQualification => Bool

Gets the tests intended for qualification in a suite.


=head2 IsLongDurationTest => Bool

Verifies if the test suite is a long duration test.


=head2 Protocol => Str

Sets the MQTT protocol that is configured in the suite definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RootGroup => Str

Gets the test suite root group. This is a required parameter. For
updating or creating the latest qualification suite, if
C<intendedForQualification> is set to true, C<rootGroup> can be an
empty string. If C<intendedForQualification> is false, C<rootGroup>
cannot be an empty string. If C<rootGroup> is empty, and
C<intendedForQualification> is set to true, all the qualification tests
are included, and the configuration is default.

For a qualification suite, the minimum length is 0, and the maximum is
2048. For a non-qualification suite, the minimum length is 1, and the
maximum is 2048.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SuiteDefinitionName => Str

Gets the suite definition name. This is a required parameter.
