Paws::SecurityLake::Tag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityLake::Tag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityLake::Tag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A I<tag> is a label that you can define and associate with Amazon Web
Services resources, including certain types of Amazon Security Lake
resources. Tags can help you identify, categorize, and manage resources
in different ways, such as by owner, environment, or other criteria.
You can associate tags with the following types of Security Lake
resources: subscribers, and the data lake configuration for your Amazon
Web Services account in individual Amazon Web Services Regions.

A resource can have up to 50 tags. Each tag consists of a required
I<tag key> and an associated I<tag value>. A I<tag key> is a general
label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. Each tag
key must be unique and it can have only one tag value. A I<tag value>
acts as a descriptor for a tag key. Tag keys and values are case
sensitive. They can contain letters, numbers, spaces, or the following
symbols: _ . : / = + @ -

For more information, see Tagging Amazon Security Lake resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/tagging-resources.html)
in the I<Amazon Security Lake User Guide>.
