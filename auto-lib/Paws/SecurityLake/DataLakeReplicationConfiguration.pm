=head1 NAME

Paws::SecurityLake::DataLakeReplicationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SecurityLake::DataLakeReplicationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Regions => $value, ..., RoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SecurityLake::DataLakeReplicationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Regions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides replication details for objects stored in the Amazon Security
Lake data lake.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Regions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies one or more centralized rollup Regions. The Amazon Web
Services Region specified in the C<region> parameter of the
C<CreateDataLake>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDataLake.html)
or C<UpdateDataLake>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDataLake.html)
operations contributes data to the rollup Region or Regions specified
in this parameter.

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across
Amazon S3 buckets. S3 buckets that are configured for object
replication can be owned by the same Amazon Web Services account or by
different accounts. You can replicate objects to a single destination
bucket or to multiple destination buckets. The destination buckets can
be in different Regions or within the same Region as the source bucket.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

Replication settings for the Amazon S3 buckets. This parameter uses the
Identity and Access Management (IAM) role you created that is managed
by Security Lake, to ensure the replication setting is correct.
