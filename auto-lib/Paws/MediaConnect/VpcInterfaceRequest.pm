=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::VpcInterfaceRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::VpcInterfaceRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., SubnetId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::VpcInterfaceRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the VPC interfaces that you want to add to the flow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name for the VPC interface. This name must be unique within the
flow.


=head2 NetworkInterfaceType => Str

The type of network interface.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that you created when you
set up MediaConnect as a trusted service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A virtual firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetId => Str

The subnet IDs that you want to use for your VPC interface. A range of
IP addresses in your VPC. When you create your VPC, you specify a range
of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16. This is the primary
CIDR block for your VPC. When you create a subnet for your VPC, you
specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC
CIDR block. The subnets that you use across all VPC interfaces on the
flow must be in the same Availability Zone as the flow.
