=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::NdiConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::NdiConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MachineName => $value, ..., NdiState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::NdiConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MachineName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration settings for NDI outputs. Required when the
flow includes NDI outputs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MachineName => Str

A prefix for the names of the NDI sources that the flow creates. If a
custom name isn't specified, MediaConnect generates a unique
12-character ID as the prefix.


=head2 NdiDiscoveryServers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::NdiDiscoveryServerConfig>]

A list of up to three NDI discovery server configurations. While not
required by the API, this configuration is necessary for NDI
functionality to work properly.


=head2 NdiState => Str

A setting that controls whether NDI outputs can be used in the flow.
Must be ENABLED to add NDI outputs. Default is DISABLED.
