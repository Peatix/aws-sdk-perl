=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::AddOutputRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::AddOutputRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CidrAllowList => $value, ..., VpcInterfaceAttachment => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::AddOutputRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CidrAllowList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A request to add an output to a flow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CidrAllowList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The range of IP addresses that should be allowed to initiate output
requests to this flow. These IP addresses should be in the form of a
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the output. This description appears only on the Audit
Manager console and will not be seen by the end user.


=head2 Destination => Str

The IP address from which video will be sent to output destinations.


=head2 Encryption => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Encryption>

The type of key used for the encryption. If no keyType is provided, the
service will use the default setting (static-key). Allowable encryption
types: static-key.


=head2 MaxLatency => Int

The maximum latency in milliseconds. This parameter applies only to
RIST-based and Zixi-based streams.


=head2 MediaStreamOutputConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamOutputConfigurationRequest>]

The media streams that are associated with the output, and the
parameters for those associations.


=head2 MinLatency => Int

The minimum latency in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In streams
that use the SRT protocol, this value that you set on your MediaConnect
source or output represents the minimal potential latency of that
connection. The latency of the stream is set to the highest number
between the senderE<rsquo>s minimum latency and the receiverE<rsquo>s
minimum latency.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the output. This value must be unique within the current
flow.


=head2 NdiProgramName => Str

A suffix for the names of the NDI sources that the flow creates. If a
custom name isn't specified, MediaConnect uses the output name.


=head2 NdiSpeedHqQuality => Int

A quality setting for the NDI Speed HQ encoder.


=head2 OutputStatus => Str

An indication of whether the new output should be enabled or disabled
as soon as it is created. If you don't specify the outputStatus field
in your request, MediaConnect sets it to ENABLED.


=head2 Port => Int

The port to use when content is distributed to this output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protocol => Str

The protocol to use for the output.

Elemental MediaConnect no longer supports the Fujitsu QoS protocol.
This reference is maintained for legacy purposes only.


=head2 RemoteId => Str

The remote ID for the Zixi-pull output stream.


=head2 SenderControlPort => Int

The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to initiate
connection with the sender.


=head2 SmoothingLatency => Int

The smoothing latency in milliseconds for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC
streams.


=head2 StreamId => Str

The stream ID that you want to use for this transport. This parameter
applies only to Zixi and SRT caller-based streams.


=head2 VpcInterfaceAttachment => L<Paws::MediaConnect::VpcInterfaceAttachment>

The name of the VPC interface attachment to use for this output.
