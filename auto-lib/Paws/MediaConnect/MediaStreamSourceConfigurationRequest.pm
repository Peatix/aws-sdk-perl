=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamSourceConfigurationRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamSourceConfigurationRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncodingName => $value, ..., MediaStreamName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamSourceConfigurationRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncodingName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The media stream that you want to associate with the source, and the
parameters for that association.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncodingName => Str

The format that was used to encode the data. For ancillary data
streams, set the encoding name to smpte291. For audio streams, set the
encoding name to pcm. For video, 2110 streams, set the encoding name to
raw. For video, JPEG XS streams, set the encoding name to jxsv.


=head2 InputConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::InputConfigurationRequest>]

The media streams that you want to associate with the source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MediaStreamName => Str

The name of the media stream.
