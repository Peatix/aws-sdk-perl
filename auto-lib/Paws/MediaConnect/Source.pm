=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::Source

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::Source object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent => $value, ..., WhitelistCidr => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::Source object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings for the source of the flow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent => Int

Percentage from 0-100 of the data transfer cost to be billed to the
subscriber.


=head2 Decryption => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Encryption>

source.


=head2 Description => Str

A description for the source. This value is not used or seen outside of
the current MediaConnect account.


=head2 EntitlementArn => Str

The ARN of the entitlement that allows you to subscribe to content that
comes from another Amazon Web Services account. The entitlement is set
by the content originator and the ARN is generated as part of the
originator's flow.


=head2 GatewayBridgeSource => L<Paws::MediaConnect::GatewayBridgeSource>

The source configuration for cloud flows receiving a stream from a
bridge.


=head2 IngestIp => Str

The IP address that the flow will be listening on for incoming content.


=head2 IngestPort => Int

The port that the flow will be listening on for incoming content.


=head2 MediaStreamSourceConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamSourceConfiguration>]

The media streams that are associated with the source, and the
parameters for those associations.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the source.


=head2 SenderControlPort => Int

The IP address that the flow communicates with to initiate connection
with the sender.


=head2 SenderIpAddress => Str

The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to initiate
connection with the sender.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceArn => Str

The ARN of the source.


=head2 Transport => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Transport>

Attributes related to the transport stream that are used in the source.


=head2 VpcInterfaceName => Str

The name of the VPC interface that is used for this source.


=head2 WhitelistCidr => Str
