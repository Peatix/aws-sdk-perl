=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::UpdateIngressGatewayBridgeRequest

=head1 USAGE

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::UpdateIngressGatewayBridgeRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxBitrate => $value, ..., MaxOutputs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::UpdateIngressGatewayBridgeRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxBitrate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Update an existing ingress-type bridge.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxBitrate => Int

The maximum expected bitrate (in bps).


=head2 MaxOutputs => Int

The maximum number of expected outputs.
