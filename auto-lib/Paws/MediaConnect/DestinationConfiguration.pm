=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::DestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::DestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationIp => $value, ..., OutboundIp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::DestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationIp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The transport parameters that you want to associate with an outbound
media stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationIp => Str

The IP address where you want MediaConnect to send contents of the
media stream.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationPort => Int

The port that you want MediaConnect to use when it distributes the
media stream to the output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Interface => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Interface>

The VPC interface that you want to use for the media stream associated
with the output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutboundIp => Str

The IP address that the receiver requires in order to establish a
connection with the flow. This value is represented by the elastic
network interface IP address of the VPC. This field applies only to
outputs that use the CDI or ST 2110 JPEG XS or protocol.
