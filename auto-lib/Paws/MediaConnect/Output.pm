=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::Output

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::Output object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BridgeArn => $value, ..., VpcInterfaceAttachment => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::Output object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BridgeArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings for an output.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BridgeArn => Str

The ARN of the bridge added to this output.


=head2 BridgePorts => ArrayRef[Int]

The bridge output ports currently in use.


=head2 DataTransferSubscriberFeePercent => Int

Percentage from 0-100 of the data transfer cost to be billed to the
subscriber.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the output.


=head2 Destination => Str

The address where you want to send the output.


=head2 Encryption => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Encryption>

The type of key used for the encryption. If no keyType is provided, the
service will use the default setting (static-key).


=head2 EntitlementArn => Str

The ARN of the entitlement on the originator''s flow. This value is
relevant only on entitled flows.


=head2 ListenerAddress => Str

The IP address that the receiver requires in order to establish a
connection with the flow. For public networking, the ListenerAddress is
represented by the elastic IP address of the flow. For private
networking, the ListenerAddress is represented by the elastic network
interface IP address of the VPC. This field applies only to outputs
that use the Zixi pull or SRT listener protocol.


=head2 MediaLiveInputArn => Str

The input ARN of the MediaLive channel. This parameter is relevant only
for outputs that were added by creating a MediaLive input.


=head2 MediaStreamOutputConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::MediaStreamOutputConfiguration>]

The configuration for each media stream that is associated with the
output.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the output. This value must be unique within the current
flow.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputArn => Str

The ARN of the output.


=head2 OutputStatus => Str

An indication of whether the output is transmitting data or not.


=head2 Port => Int

The port to use when content is distributed to this output.


=head2 Transport => L<Paws::MediaConnect::Transport>

Attributes related to the transport stream that are used in the output.


=head2 VpcInterfaceAttachment => L<Paws::MediaConnect::VpcInterfaceAttachment>

The name of the VPC interface attachment to use for this output.
