=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::Gateway

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::Gateway object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EgressCidrBlocks => $value, ..., Networks => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::Gateway object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EgressCidrBlocks

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings for a gateway, including its networks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EgressCidrBlocks => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The range of IP addresses that contribute content or initiate output
requests for flows communicating with this gateway. These IP addresses
should be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block;
for example, 10.0.0.0/16.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GatewayArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway.


=head2 GatewayMessages => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::MessageDetail>]

Messages with information about the gateway.


=head2 GatewayState => Str

The current status of the gateway.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the gateway. This name can not be modified after the
gateway is created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Networks => ArrayRef[L<Paws::MediaConnect::GatewayNetwork>]

The list of networks in the gateway.
