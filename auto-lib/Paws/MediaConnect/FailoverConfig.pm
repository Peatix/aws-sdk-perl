=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::FailoverConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::FailoverConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailoverMode => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::FailoverConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailoverMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings for source failover.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FailoverMode => Str

The type of failover you choose for this flow. MERGE combines the
source streams into a single stream, allowing graceful recovery from
any single-source loss. FAILOVER allows switching between different
streams.


=head2 RecoveryWindow => Int

Search window time to look for dash-7 packets.


=head2 SourcePriority => L<Paws::MediaConnect::SourcePriority>

The priority you want to assign to a source. You can have a primary
stream and a backup stream or two equally prioritized streams.


=head2 State => Str

The state of source failover on the flow. If the state is inactive, the
flow can have only one source. If the state is active, the flow can
have one or two sources.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::MediaConnect>
