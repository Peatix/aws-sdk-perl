=head1 NAME

Paws::MediaConnect::IngressGatewayBridge

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::MediaConnect::IngressGatewayBridge object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceId => $value, ..., MaxOutputs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::MediaConnect::IngressGatewayBridge object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Create a bridge with the ingress bridge type. An ingress bridge is a
ground-to-cloud bridge. The content originates at your premises and is
delivered to the cloud.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstanceId => Str

The ID of the instance running this bridge.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxBitrate => Int

The maximum expected bitrate (in bps) of the ingress bridge.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxOutputs => Int

The maximum number of outputs on the ingress bridge.
