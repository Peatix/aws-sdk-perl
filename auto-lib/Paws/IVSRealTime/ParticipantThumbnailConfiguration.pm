=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantThumbnailConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantThumbnailConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RecordingMode => $value, ..., TargetIntervalSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantThumbnailConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RecordingMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a configuration of thumbnails for recorded video
from an individual participant.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RecordingMode => Str

Thumbnail recording mode. Default: C<DISABLED>.


=head2 Storage => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates the format in which thumbnails are recorded. C<SEQUENTIAL>
records all generated thumbnails in a serial manner, to the
media/thumbnails/high directory. C<LATEST> saves the latest thumbnail
in media/latest_thumbnail/high/thumb.jpg and overwrites it at the
interval specified by C<targetIntervalSeconds>. You can enable both
C<SEQUENTIAL> and C<LATEST>. Default: C<SEQUENTIAL>.


=head2 TargetIntervalSeconds => Int

The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in seconds. This is
configurable only if C<recordingMode> is C<INTERVAL>. Default: 60.
