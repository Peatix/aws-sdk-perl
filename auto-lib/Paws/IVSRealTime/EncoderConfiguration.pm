As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::EncoderConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Video => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::EncoderConfiguration object:
