=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionRecordingHlsConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionRecordingHlsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TargetSegmentDurationSeconds => $value, ..., TargetSegmentDurationSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionRecordingHlsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TargetSegmentDurationSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a configuration of HLS recordings for
server-side composition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TargetSegmentDurationSeconds => Int

Defines the target duration for recorded segments generated when using
composite recording. Segments may have durations shorter than the
specified value when needed to ensure each segment begins with a
keyframe. Default: 2.
