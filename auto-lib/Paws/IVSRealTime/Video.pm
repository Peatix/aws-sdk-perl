=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::Video

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::Video object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bitrate => $value, ..., Width => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::Video object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bitrate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for video.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Bitrate => Int

Bitrate for generated output, in bps. Default: 2500000.


=head2 Framerate => Num

Video frame rate, in fps. Default: 30.


=head2 Height => Int

Video-resolution height. This must be an even number. Note that the
maximum value is determined by C<width> times C<height>, such that the
maximum total pixels is 2073600 (1920x1080 or 1080x1920). Default: 720.


=head2 Width => Int

Video-resolution width. This must be an even number. Note that the
maximum value is determined by C<width> times C<height>, such that the
maximum total pixels is 2073600 (1920x1080 or 1080x1920). Default:
1280.
