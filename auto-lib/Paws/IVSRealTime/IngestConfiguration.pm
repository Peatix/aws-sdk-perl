=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::IngestConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::IngestConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., UserId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::IngestConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying an ingest configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Ingest configuration ARN.


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantAttributes>

Application-provided attributes to to store in the IngestConfiguration
and attach to a stage. Map keys and values can contain UTF-8 encoded
text. The maximum length of this field is 1 KB total. I<This field is
exposed to all stage participants and should not be used for personally
identifying, confidential, or sensitive information.>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IngestProtocol => Str

Type of ingest protocol that the user employs for broadcasting.


=head2 Name => Str

Ingest name


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ParticipantId => Str

ID of the participant within the stage.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StageArn => Str

ARN of the stage with which the IngestConfiguration is associated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> State => Str

State of the ingest configuration. It is C<ACTIVE> if a publisher
currently is publishing to the stage associated with the ingest
configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StreamKey => Str

Ingest-key value for the RTMP(S) protocol.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::Tags>

Tags attached to the resource. Array of maps, each of the form
C<string:string (key:value)>. See Best practices and strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html)
in I<Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor> for details, including
restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no constraints on tags beyond what is
documented there.


=head2 UserId => Str
