=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::GridConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::GridConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FeaturedParticipantAttribute => $value, ..., VideoFillMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::GridConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FeaturedParticipantAttribute

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration information specific to Grid layout, for server-side
composition. See "Layouts" in Server-Side Composition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/RealTimeUserGuide/server-side-composition.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FeaturedParticipantAttribute => Str

This attribute name identifies the featured slot. A participant with
this attribute set to C<"true"> (as a string value) in
ParticipantTokenConfiguration is placed in the featured slot. Default:
C<""> (no featured participant).


=head2 GridGap => Int

Specifies the spacing between participant tiles in pixels. Default:
C<2>.


=head2 OmitStoppedVideo => Bool

Determines whether to omit participants with stopped video in the
composition. Default: C<false>.


=head2 VideoAspectRatio => Str

Sets the non-featured participant display mode, to control the aspect
ratio of video tiles. C<VIDEO> is 16:9, C<SQUARE> is 1:1, and
C<PORTRAIT> is 3:4. Default: C<VIDEO>.


=head2 VideoFillMode => Str

Defines how video content fits within the participant tile: C<FILL>
(stretched), C<COVER> (cropped), or C<CONTAIN> (letterboxed). When not
set, C<videoFillMode> defaults to C<COVER> fill mode for participants
in the grid and to C<CONTAIN> fill mode for featured participants.
