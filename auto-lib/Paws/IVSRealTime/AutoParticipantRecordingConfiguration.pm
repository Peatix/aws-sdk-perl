=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::AutoParticipantRecordingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::AutoParticipantRecordingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HlsConfiguration => $value, ..., ThumbnailConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::AutoParticipantRecordingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HlsConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying a configuration for individual participant recording.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HlsConfiguration => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantRecordingHlsConfiguration>

HLS configuration object for individual participant recording.


=head2 MediaTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Types of media to be recorded. Default: C<AUDIO_VIDEO>.


=head2 RecordingReconnectWindowSeconds => Int

If a stage publisher disconnects and then reconnects within the
specified interval, the multiple recordings will be considered a single
recording and merged together.

The default value is 0, which disables merging.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StorageConfigurationArn => Str

ARN of the StorageConfiguration resource to use for individual
participant recording. Default: C<""> (empty string, no storage
configuration is specified). Individual participant recording cannot be
started unless a storage configuration is specified, when a Stage is
created or updated. To disable individual participant recording, set
this to C<"">; other fields in this object will get reset to their
defaults when sending C<"">.


=head2 ThumbnailConfiguration => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::ParticipantThumbnailConfiguration>

A complex type that allows you to enable/disable the recording of
thumbnails for individual participant recording and modify the interval
at which thumbnails are generated for the live session.
