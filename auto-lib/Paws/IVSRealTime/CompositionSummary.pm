=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary information about a Composition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

ARN of the Composition resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IVSRealTime::DestinationSummary>]

Array of Destination objects.


=head2 EndTime => Str

UTC time of the Composition end. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp; I<note
that this is returned as a string>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StageArn => Str

ARN of the attached stage.


=head2 StartTime => Str

UTC time of the Composition start. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
I<note that this is returned as a string>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> State => Str

State of the Composition resource.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::Tags>

Tags attached to the resource. Array of maps, each of the form
C<string:string (key:value)>. See Best practices and strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html)
in I<Tagging AWS Resources and Tag Editor> for details, including
restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no constraints on tags beyond what is
documented there.
