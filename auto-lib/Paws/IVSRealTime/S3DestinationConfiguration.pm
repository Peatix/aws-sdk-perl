=head1 NAME

Paws::IVSRealTime::S3DestinationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVSRealTime::S3DestinationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EncoderConfigurationArns => $value, ..., ThumbnailConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVSRealTime::S3DestinationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EncoderConfigurationArns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that describes an S3 location where recorded videos will
be stored.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EncoderConfigurationArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

ARNs of the EncoderConfiguration resource. The encoder configuration
and stage resources must be in the same AWS account and region.


=head2 RecordingConfiguration => L<Paws::IVSRealTime::RecordingConfiguration>

Array of maps, each of the form C<string:string (key:value)>. This is
an optional customer specification, currently used only to specify the
recording format for storing a recording in Amazon S3.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StorageConfigurationArn => Str

ARN of the StorageConfiguration where recorded videos will be stored.


=head2 ThumbnailConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IVSRealTime::CompositionThumbnailConfiguration>]

A complex type that allows you to enable/disable the recording of
thumbnails for a Composition and modify the interval at which
thumbnails are generated for the live session.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::IVSRealTime>
