=head1 NAME

Paws::Grafana::WorkspaceDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Grafana::WorkspaceDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountAccessType => $value, ..., WorkspaceRoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Grafana::WorkspaceDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountAccessType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure containing information about an Amazon Managed Grafana
workspace in your account.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountAccessType => Str

Specifies whether the workspace can access Amazon Web Services
resources in this Amazon Web Services account only, or whether it can
also access Amazon Web Services resources in other accounts in the same
organization. If this is C<ORGANIZATION>, the
C<workspaceOrganizationalUnits> parameter specifies which
organizational units the workspace can access.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Authentication => L<Paws::Grafana::AuthenticationSummary>

A structure that describes whether the workspace uses SAML, IAM
Identity Center, or both methods for user authentication.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Created => Str

The date that the workspace was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataSources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the Amazon Web Services data sources that have been
configured to have IAM roles and permissions created to allow Amazon
Managed Grafana to read data from these sources.

This list is only used when the workspace was created through the
Amazon Web Services console, and the C<permissionType> is
C<SERVICE_MANAGED>.


=head2 Description => Str

The user-defined description of the workspace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Endpoint => Str

The URL that users can use to access the Grafana console in the
workspace.


=head2 FreeTrialConsumed => Bool

Specifies whether this workspace has already fully used its free trial
for Grafana Enterprise.

Amazon Managed Grafana workspaces no longer support Grafana Enterprise
free trials.


=head2 FreeTrialExpiration => Str

If this workspace is currently in the free trial period for Grafana
Enterprise, this value specifies when that free trial ends.

Amazon Managed Grafana workspaces no longer support Grafana Enterprise
free trials.


=head2 GrafanaToken => Str

The token that ties this workspace to a Grafana Labs account. For more
information, see Link your account with Grafana Labs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/upgrade-to-Grafana-Enterprise.html#AMG-workspace-register-enterprise).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GrafanaVersion => Str

The version of Grafana supported in this workspace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The unique ID of this workspace.


=head2 LicenseExpiration => Str

If this workspace has a full Grafana Enterprise license purchased
through Amazon Web Services Marketplace, this specifies when the
license ends and will need to be renewed. Purchasing the Enterprise
plugins option through Amazon Managed Grafana does not have an
expiration. It is valid until the license is removed.


=head2 LicenseType => Str

Specifies whether this workspace has a full Grafana Enterprise license.

Amazon Managed Grafana workspaces no longer support Grafana Enterprise
free trials.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Modified => Str

The most recent date that the workspace was modified.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the workspace.


=head2 NetworkAccessControl => L<Paws::Grafana::NetworkAccessConfiguration>

The configuration settings for network access to your workspace.


=head2 NotificationDestinations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Web Services notification channels that Amazon Managed
Grafana can automatically create IAM roles and permissions for, to
allow Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.


=head2 OrganizationalUnits => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to
use data sources from, if this workspace is in an account that is part
of an organization.


=head2 OrganizationRoleName => Str

The name of the IAM role that is used to access resources through
Organizations.


=head2 PermissionType => Str

If this is C<SERVICE_MANAGED>, and the workplace was created through
the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon Managed Grafana
automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the permissions that
the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and
notification channels.

If this is C<CUSTOMER_MANAGED>, you must manage those roles and
permissions yourself.

If you are working with a workspace in a member account of an
organization and that account is not a delegated administrator account,
and you want the workspace to access data sources in other Amazon Web
Services accounts in the organization, this parameter must be set to
C<CUSTOMER_MANAGED>.

For more information about converting between customer and service
managed, see Managing permissions for data sources and notification
channels
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-datasource-and-notification.html).
For more information about the roles and permissions that must be
managed for customer managed workspaces, see Amazon Managed Grafana
permissions and policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and
notification channels
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-manage-permissions.html)


=head2 StackSetName => Str

The name of the CloudFormation stack set that is used to generate IAM
roles to be used for this workspace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The current status of the workspace.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Grafana::TagMap>

The list of tags associated with the workspace.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Grafana::VpcConfiguration>

The configuration for connecting to data sources in a private VPC
(Amazon Virtual Private Cloud).


=head2 WorkspaceRoleArn => Str

The IAM role that grants permissions to the Amazon Web Services
resources that the workspace will view data from. This role must
already exist.
