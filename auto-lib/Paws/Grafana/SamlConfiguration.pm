=head1 NAME

Paws::Grafana::SamlConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Grafana::SamlConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedOrganizations => $value, ..., RoleValues => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Grafana::SamlConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedOrganizations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure containing information about how this workspace works with
SAML.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedOrganizations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Lists which organizations defined in the SAML assertion are allowed to
use the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace. If this is empty, all
organizations in the assertion attribute have access.


=head2 AssertionAttributes => L<Paws::Grafana::AssertionAttributes>

A structure that defines which attributes in the SAML assertion are to
be used to define information about the users authenticated by that IdP
to use the workspace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IdpMetadata => L<Paws::Grafana::IdpMetadata>

A structure containing the identity provider (IdP) metadata used to
integrate the identity provider with this workspace.


=head2 LoginValidityDuration => Int

How long a sign-on session by a SAML user is valid, before the user has
to sign on again.


=head2 RoleValues => L<Paws::Grafana::RoleValues>

A structure containing arrays that map group names in the SAML
assertion to the Grafana C<Admin> and C<Editor> roles in the workspace.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Grafana>
