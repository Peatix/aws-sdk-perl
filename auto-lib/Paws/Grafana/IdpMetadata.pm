=head1 NAME

Paws::Grafana::IdpMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Grafana::IdpMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Url => $value, ..., Xml => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Grafana::IdpMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Url

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure containing the identity provider (IdP) metadata used to
integrate the identity provider with this workspace. You can specify
the metadata either by providing a URL to its location in the C<url>
parameter, or by specifying the full metadata in XML format in the
C<xml> parameter. Specifying both will cause an error.
