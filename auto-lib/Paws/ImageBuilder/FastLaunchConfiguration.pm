=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::FastLaunchConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::FastLaunchConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., SnapshotConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::FastLaunchConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Define and configure faster launching for output Windows AMIs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The owner account ID for the fast-launch enabled Windows AMI.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

A Boolean that represents the current state of faster launching for the
Windows AMI. Set to C<true> to start using Windows faster launching, or
C<false> to stop using it.


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::ImageBuilder::FastLaunchLaunchTemplateSpecification>

The launch template that the fast-launch enabled Windows AMI uses when
it launches Windows instances to create pre-provisioned snapshots.


=head2 MaxParallelLaunches => Int

The maximum number of parallel instances that are launched for creating
resources.


=head2 SnapshotConfiguration => L<Paws::ImageBuilder::FastLaunchSnapshotConfiguration>

Configuration settings for managing the number of snapshots that are
created from pre-provisioned instances for the Windows AMI when faster
launching is enabled.
