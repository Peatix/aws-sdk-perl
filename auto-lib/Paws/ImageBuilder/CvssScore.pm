=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::CvssScore

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::CvssScore object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseScore => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::CvssScore object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseScore

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon Inspector generates a risk score for each finding. This score
helps you to prioritize findings, to focus on the most critical
findings and the most vulnerable resources. The score uses the Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) format. This format is a
modification of the base CVSS score that the National Vulnerability
Database (NVD) provides. For more information about severity levels,
see Severity levels for Amazon Inspector findings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/findings-understanding-severity.html)
in the I<Amazon Inspector User Guide>.

The CVSS base score.


=head2 ScoringVector => Str

The vector string of the CVSS score.


=head2 Source => Str
