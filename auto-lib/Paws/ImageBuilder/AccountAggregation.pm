=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::AccountAggregation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::AccountAggregation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., SeverityCounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::AccountAggregation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains counts of vulnerability findings from image scans that run
when you create new Image Builder images, or build new versions of
existing images. The vulnerability counts are grouped by severity
level. The counts are aggregated across resources to create the final
tally for the account that owns them.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

Identifies the account that owns the aggregated resource findings.


=head2 SeverityCounts => L<Paws::ImageBuilder::SeverityCounts>

Counts by severity level for medium severity and higher level findings,
plus a total for all of the findings.
