=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OnFailure => $value, ..., WorkflowArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OnFailure

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains control settings and configurable inputs for a workflow
resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OnFailure => Str

The action to take if the workflow fails.


=head2 ParallelGroup => Str

Test workflows are defined within named runtime groups called parallel
groups. The parallel group is the named group that contains this test
workflow. Test workflows within a parallel group can run at the same
time. Image Builder starts up to five test workflows in the group at
the same time, and starts additional workflows as others complete,
until all workflows in the group have completed. This field only
applies for test workflows.


=head2 Parameters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowParameter>]

Contains parameter values for each of the parameters that the workflow
document defined for the workflow resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WorkflowArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource.
