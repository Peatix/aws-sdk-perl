=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowExecutionMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowExecutionMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndTime => $value, ..., WorkflowExecutionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::WorkflowExecutionMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metadata that includes details and status from this runtime instance of
the workflow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndTime => Str

The timestamp when this runtime instance of the workflow finished.


=head2 Message => Str

The runtime output message from the workflow, if applicable.


=head2 ParallelGroup => Str

The name of the test group that included the test workflow resource at
runtime.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The timestamp when the runtime instance of this workflow started.


=head2 Status => Str

The current runtime status for this workflow.


=head2 TotalStepCount => Int

The total number of steps in the workflow. This should equal the sum of
the step counts for steps that succeeded, were skipped, and failed.


=head2 TotalStepsFailed => Int

A runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow that failed.


=head2 TotalStepsSkipped => Int

A runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow that were
skipped.


=head2 TotalStepsSucceeded => Int

A runtime count for the number of steps in the workflow that ran
successfully.


=head2 Type => Str

Indicates what type of workflow that Image Builder ran for this runtime
instance of the workflow.


=head2 WorkflowBuildVersionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the workflow resource build version
that ran.


=head2 WorkflowExecutionId => Str

Unique identifier that Image Builder assigns to keep track of runtime
resources each time it runs a workflow.
