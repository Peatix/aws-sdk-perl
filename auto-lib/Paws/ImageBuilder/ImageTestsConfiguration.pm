=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::ImageTestsConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImageTestsEnabled => $value, ..., TimeoutMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::ImageTestsConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImageTestsEnabled

Configure image tests for your pipeline build. Tests run after building
the image, to verify that the AMI or container image is valid before
distributing it.

defaults to enable tests to run following the image build, before image
distribution.
