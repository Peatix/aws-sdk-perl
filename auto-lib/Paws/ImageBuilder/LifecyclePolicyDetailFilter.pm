=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::LifecyclePolicyDetailFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::LifecyclePolicyDetailFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RetainAtLeast => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::LifecyclePolicyDetailFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RetainAtLeast

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines filters that the lifecycle policy uses to determine impacted
resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RetainAtLeast => Int

For age-based filters, this is the number of resources to keep on hand
after the lifecycle C<DELETE> action is applied. Impacted resources are
only deleted if you have more than this number of resources. If you
have fewer resources than this number, the impacted resource is not
deleted.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

Filter resources based on either C<age> or C<count>.


=head2 Unit => Str

Defines the unit of time that the lifecycle policy uses to determine
impacted resources. This is required for age-based rules.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Int

The number of units for the time period or for the count. For example,
a value of C<6> might refer to six months or six AMIs.

For count-based filters, this value represents the minimum number of
resources to keep on hand. If you have fewer resources than this
number, the resource is excluded from lifecycle actions.
