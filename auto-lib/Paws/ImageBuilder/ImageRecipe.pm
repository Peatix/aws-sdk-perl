=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::ImageRecipe

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::ImageRecipe object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalInstanceConfiguration => $value, ..., WorkingDirectory => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::ImageRecipe object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalInstanceConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An image recipe.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalInstanceConfiguration => L<Paws::ImageBuilder::AdditionalInstanceConfiguration>

Before you create a new AMI, Image Builder launches temporary Amazon
EC2 instances to build and test your image configuration. Instance
configuration adds a layer of control over those instances. You can
define settings and add scripts to run when an instance is launched
from your AMI.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the image recipe.


=head2 BlockDeviceMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceBlockDeviceMapping>]

The block device mappings to apply when creating images from this
recipe.


=head2 Components => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ImageBuilder::ComponentConfiguration>]

The components that are included in the image recipe. Recipes require a
minimum of one build component, and can have a maximum of 20 build and
test components in any combination.


=head2 DateCreated => Str

The date on which this image recipe was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the image recipe.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the image recipe.


=head2 Owner => Str

The owner of the image recipe.


=head2 ParentImage => Str

The base image for customizations specified in the image recipe. You
can specify the parent image using one of the following options:

=over

=item *

AMI ID

=item *

Image Builder image Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

=item *

Amazon Web Services Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store Parameter,

=back



=head2 Platform => Str

The platform of the image recipe.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::ImageBuilder::TagMap>

The tags of the image recipe.


=head2 Type => Str

Specifies which type of image is created by the recipe - an AMI or a
container image.


=head2 Version => Str

The version of the image recipe.


=head2 WorkingDirectory => Str

The working directory to be used during build and test workflows.
