=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BlockDeviceMappings => $value, ..., Image => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BlockDeviceMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines a custom base AMI and block device mapping configurations of an
instance used for building and testing container images.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BlockDeviceMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceBlockDeviceMapping>]

Defines the block devices to attach for building an instance from this
Image Builder AMI.


=head2 Image => Str

The base image for a container build and test instance. This can
contain an AMI ID or it can specify an Amazon Web Services Systems
Manager (SSM) Parameter Store Parameter, prefixed by C<ssm:>, followed
by the parameter name or ARN.

If not specified, Image Builder uses the appropriate ECS-optimized AMI
as a base image.
