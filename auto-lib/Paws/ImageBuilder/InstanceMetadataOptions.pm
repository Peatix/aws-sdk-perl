=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceMetadataOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HttpPutResponseHopLimit => $value, ..., HttpTokens => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::InstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HttpPutResponseHopLimit

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The instance metadata options that apply to the HTTP requests that
pipeline builds use to launch EC2 build and test instances. For more
information about instance metadata options, see Configure the instance
metadata options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EC2 User Guide> > for Linux instances, or Configure
the instance metadata options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-options.html)
in the I< I<Amazon EC2 Windows Guide> > for Windows instances.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HttpPutResponseHopLimit => Int

Limit the number of hops that an instance metadata request can traverse
to reach its destination. The default is one hop. However, if HTTP
tokens are required, container image builds need a minimum of two hops.


=head2 HttpTokens => Str

Indicates whether a signed token header is required for instance
metadata retrieval requests. The values affect the response as follows:

=over

=item *

B<required> E<ndash> When you retrieve the IAM role credentials,
version 2.0 credentials are returned in all cases.

=item *

B<optional> E<ndash> You can include a signed token header in your
request to retrieve instance metadata, or you can leave it out. If you
include it, version 2.0 credentials are returned for the IAM role.
Otherwise, version 1.0 credentials are returned.

=back

The default setting is B<optional>.
