=head1 NAME

Paws::ImageBuilder::Schedule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ImageBuilder::Schedule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PipelineExecutionStartCondition => $value, ..., Timezone => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ImageBuilder::Schedule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PipelineExecutionStartCondition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A schedule configures when and how often a pipeline will automatically
create a new image.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PipelineExecutionStartCondition => Str

The start condition configures when the pipeline should trigger a new
image build, as follows. If no value is set Image Builder defaults to
C<EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE>.

=over

=item *

C<EXPRESSION_MATCH_AND_DEPENDENCY_UPDATES_AVAILABLE> (default) E<ndash>
When you use semantic version filters on the base image or components
in your image recipe, EC2 Image Builder builds a new image only when
there are new versions of the base image or components in your recipe
that match the filter.

For semantic version syntax, see CreateComponent
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/APIReference/API_CreateComponent.html).

=item *

C<EXPRESSION_MATCH_ONLY> E<ndash> This condition builds a new image
every time the CRON expression matches the current time.

=back



=head2 ScheduleExpression => Str

The cron expression determines how often EC2 Image Builder evaluates
your C<pipelineExecutionStartCondition>.

For information on how to format a cron expression in Image Builder,
see Use cron expressions in EC2 Image Builder
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/image-builder-cron.html).


=head2 Timezone => Str

The timezone that applies to the scheduling expression. For example,
"Etc/UTC", "America/Los_Angeles" in the IANA timezone format
(https://www.joda.org/joda-time/timezones.html). If not specified this
defaults to UTC.
