=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::EntryDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::EntryDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EntryDetail => $value, ..., EntryType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::EntryDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EntryDetail

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a single rule in a network ACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EntryDetail => L<Paws::FMS::NetworkAclEntry>

Describes a rule in a network ACL.

Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set
of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be
allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the network ACL, Amazon
Web Services processes the entries in the network ACL according to the
rule numbers, in ascending order.

When you manage an individual network ACL, you explicitly specify the
rule numbers. When you specify the network ACL rules in a Firewall
Manager policy, you provide the rules to run first, in the order that
you want them to run, and the rules to run last, in the order that you
want them to run. Firewall Manager assigns the rule numbers for you
when you save the network ACL policy specification.


=head2 EntryRuleNumber => Int

The rule number for the entry. ACL entries are processed in ascending
order by rule number. In a Firewall Manager network ACL policy,
Firewall Manager assigns rule numbers.


=head2 EntryType => Str

Specifies whether the entry is managed by Firewall Manager or by a
user, and, for Firewall Manager-managed entries, specifies whether the
entry is among those that run first in the network ACL or those that
run last.
