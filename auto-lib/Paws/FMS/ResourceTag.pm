=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::ResourceTag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::ResourceTag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::ResourceTag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The resource tags that Firewall Manager uses to determine if a
particular resource should be included or excluded from the Firewall
Manager policy. Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services
resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or
environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. If you
add more than one tag to a policy, you can specify whether to combine
them using the logical AND operator or the logical OR operator. For
more information, see Working with Tag Editor
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/tag-editor.html).

Every resource tag must have a string value, either a non-empty string
or an empty string. If you don't provide a value for a resource tag,
Firewall Manager saves the value as an empty string: "". When Firewall
Manager compares tags, it only matches two tags if they have the same
key and the same value. A tag with an empty string value only matches
with tags that also have an empty string value.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Key => Str

The resource tag key.


=head2 Value => Str

The resource tag value. To specify an empty string value, either don't
