=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::PolicySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::PolicySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteUnusedFMManagedResources => $value, ..., SecurityServiceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::PolicySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteUnusedFMManagedResources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details of the Firewall Manager policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteUnusedFMManagedResources => Bool

Indicates whether Firewall Manager should automatically remove
protections from resources that leave the policy scope and clean up
resources that Firewall Manager is managing for accounts when those
accounts leave policy scope. For example, Firewall Manager will
disassociate a Firewall Manager managed web ACL from a protected
customer resource when the customer resource leaves policy scope.

By default, Firewall Manager doesn't remove protections or delete
Firewall Manager managed resources.

This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Classic
policies.


=head2 PolicyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified policy.


=head2 PolicyId => Str

The ID of the specified policy.


=head2 PolicyName => Str

The name of the specified policy.


=head2 PolicyStatus => Str

Indicates whether the policy is in or out of an admin's policy or
Region scope.

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE> - The administrator can manage and delete the policy.

=item *

C<OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE> - The administrator can view the policy, but they
can't edit or delete the policy. Existing policy protections stay in
place. Any new resources that come into scope of the policy won't be
protected.

=back



=head2 RemediationEnabled => Bool

Indicates if the policy should be automatically applied to new
resources.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy. This is in
the format shown in the Amazon Web Services Resource Types Reference
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html).


=head2 SecurityServiceType => Str

The service that the policy is using to protect the resources. This
specifies the type of policy that is created, either an WAF policy, a
Shield Advanced policy, or a security group policy.
