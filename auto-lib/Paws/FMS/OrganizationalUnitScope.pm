=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::OrganizationalUnitScope

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::OrganizationalUnitScope object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllOrganizationalUnitsEnabled => $value, ..., OrganizationalUnits => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::OrganizationalUnitScope object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllOrganizationalUnitsEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the Organizations organizational units (OUs) that the specified
Firewall Manager administrator can apply policies to. For more
information about OUs in Organizations, see Managing organizational
units (OUs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html)
in the I<Organizations User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllOrganizationalUnitsEnabled => Bool

A boolean value that indicates if the administrator can apply policies
to all OUs within an organization. If true, the administrator can
manage all OUs within the organization. You can either enable
management of all OUs through this operation, or you can specify OUs to
manage in C<OrganizationalUnitScope$OrganizationalUnits>. You cannot
specify both.


=head2 ExcludeSpecifiedOrganizationalUnits => Bool

A boolean value that excludes the OUs in
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$OrganizationalUnits> from the administrator's
scope. If true, the Firewall Manager administrator can apply policies
to all OUs in the organization except for the OUs listed in
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$OrganizationalUnits>. You can either specify
a list of OUs to exclude by
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$OrganizationalUnits>, or you can enable
management of all OUs by
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$AllOrganizationalUnitsEnabled>. You cannot
specify both.


=head2 OrganizationalUnits => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of OUs within the organization that the specified Firewall
Manager administrator either can or cannot apply policies to, based on
the value of
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$ExcludeSpecifiedOrganizationalUnits>. If
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$ExcludeSpecifiedOrganizationalUnits> is set
to C<true>, then the Firewall Manager administrator can apply policies
to all OUs in the organization except for the OUs in this list. If
C<OrganizationalUnitScope$ExcludeSpecifiedOrganizationalUnits> is set
to C<false>, then the Firewall Manager administrator can only apply
policies to the OUs in this list.
