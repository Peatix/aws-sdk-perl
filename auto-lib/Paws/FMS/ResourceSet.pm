=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::ResourceSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::ResourceSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Description => $value, ..., UpdateToken => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::ResourceSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Description

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of resources to include in a policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the resource set.


=head2 Id => Str

A unique identifier for the resource set. This ID is returned in the
responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
like update and delete.


=head2 LastUpdateTime => Str

The last time that the resource set was changed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The descriptive name of the resource set. You can't change the name of
a resource set after you create it.


=head2 ResourceSetStatus => Str

Indicates whether the resource set is in or out of an admin's Region
scope.

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE> - The administrator can manage and delete the resource set.

=item *

C<OUT_OF_ADMIN_SCOPE> - The administrator can view the resource set,
but they can't edit or delete the resource set. Existing protections
stay in place. Any new resource that come into scope of the resource
set won't be protected.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceTypeList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Determines the resources that can be associated to the resource set.
Depending on your setting for max results and the number of resource
sets, a single call might not return the full list.


=head2 UpdateToken => Str

An optional token that you can use for optimistic locking. Firewall
Manager returns a token to your requests that access the resource set.
The token marks the state of the resource set resource at the time of
the request. Update tokens are not allowed when creating a resource
set. After creation, each subsequent update call to the resource set
requires the update token.

To make an unconditional change to the resource set, omit the token in
your update request. Without the token, Firewall Manager performs your
updates regardless of whether the resource set has changed since you
last retrieved it.

To make a conditional change to the resource set, provide the token in
your update request. Firewall Manager uses the token to ensure that the
resource set hasn't changed since you last retrieved it. If it has
changed, the operation fails with an C<InvalidTokenException>. If this
happens, retrieve the resource set again to get a current copy of it
with a new token. Reapply your changes as needed, then try the
operation again using the new token.
