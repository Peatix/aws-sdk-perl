Paws::FMS::GetViolationDetails - Arguments for method GetViolationDetails on L<Paws::FMS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetViolationDetails on the
L<Firewall Management Service|Paws::FMS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetViolationDetails.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetViolationDetails.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $fms = Paws->service('FMS');
    my $GetViolationDetailsResponse = $fms->GetViolationDetails(
      MemberAccount => 'MyAWSAccountId',
      PolicyId      => 'MyPolicyId',
      ResourceId    => 'MyResourceId',
      ResourceType  => 'MyResourceType',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ViolationDetail = $GetViolationDetailsResponse->ViolationDetail;

    # Returns a L<Paws::FMS::GetViolationDetailsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
