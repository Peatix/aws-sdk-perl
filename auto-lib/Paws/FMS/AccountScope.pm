organization that the specified Firewall Manager administrator can
apply policies to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Accounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of accounts within the organization that the specified
Firewall Manager administrator either can or cannot apply policies to,
based on the value of C<ExcludeSpecifiedAccounts>. If
C<ExcludeSpecifiedAccounts> is set to C<true>, then the Firewall
Manager administrator can apply policies to all members of the
organization except for the accounts in this list. If
C<ExcludeSpecifiedAccounts> is set to C<false>, then the Firewall
Manager administrator can only apply policies to the accounts in this
list.


=head2 AllAccountsEnabled => Bool

A boolean value that indicates if the administrator can apply policies
to all accounts within an organization. If true, the administrator can
apply policies to all accounts within the organization. You can either
enable management of all accounts through this operation, or you can
specify a list of accounts to manage in C<AccountScope$Accounts>. You
cannot specify both.


=head2 ExcludeSpecifiedAccounts => Bool

A boolean value that excludes the accounts in C<AccountScope$Accounts>
from the administrator's scope. If true, the Firewall Manager
administrator can apply policies to all members of the organization
except for the accounts listed in C<AccountScope$Accounts>. You can
either specify a list of accounts to exclude by
C<AccountScope$Accounts>, or you can enable management of all accounts
by C<AccountScope$AllAccountsEnabled>. You cannot specify both.
