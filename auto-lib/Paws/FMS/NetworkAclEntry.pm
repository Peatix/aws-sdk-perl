=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::NetworkAclEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::NetworkAclEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CidrBlock => $value, ..., RuleAction => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::NetworkAclEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CidrBlock

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a rule in a network ACL.

Each network ACL has a set of numbered ingress rules and a separate set
of numbered egress rules. When determining whether a packet should be
allowed in or out of a subnet associated with the network ACL, Amazon
Web Services processes the entries in the network ACL according to the
rule numbers, in ascending order.

When you manage an individual network ACL, you explicitly specify the
rule numbers. When you specify the network ACL rules in a Firewall
Manager policy, you provide the rules to run first, in the order that
you want them to run, and the rules to run last, in the order that you
want them to run. Firewall Manager assigns the rule numbers for you
when you save the network ACL policy specification.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CidrBlock => Str

The IPv4 network range to allow or deny, in CIDR notation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Egress => Bool

Indicates whether the rule is an egress, or outbound, rule (applied to
traffic leaving the subnet). If it's not an egress rule, then it's an
ingress, or inbound, rule.


=head2 IcmpTypeCode => L<Paws::FMS::NetworkAclIcmpTypeCode>

ICMP protocol: The ICMP type and code.


=head2 Ipv6CidrBlock => Str

The IPv6 network range to allow or deny, in CIDR notation.


=head2 PortRange => L<Paws::FMS::NetworkAclPortRange>

TCP or UDP protocols: The range of ports the rule applies to.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protocol => Str

The protocol number. A value of "-1" means all protocols.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleAction => Str

Indicates whether to allow or deny the traffic that matches the rule.
