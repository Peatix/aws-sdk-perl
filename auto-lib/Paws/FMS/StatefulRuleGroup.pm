=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Override => L<Paws::FMS::NetworkFirewallStatefulRuleGroupOverride>

The action that allows the policy owner to override the behavior of the
rule group within a policy.


=head2 Priority => Int

An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the
stateful rule groups in a single Network Firewall firewall policy. This
setting only applies to firewall policies that specify the
C<STRICT_ORDER> rule order in the stateful engine options settings.

Network Firewall evalutes each stateful rule group against a packet
starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must
ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy. For
information about

You can change the priority settings of your rule groups at any time.
To make it easier to insert rule groups later, number them so there's a
wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.


=head2 ResourceId => Str

The resource ID of the rule group.


=head2 RuleGroupName => Str

The name of the rule group.
