=head1 NAME

Paws::FMS::NetworkFirewallPolicyDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FMS::NetworkFirewallPolicyDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { StatefulDefaultActions => $value, ..., StatelessRuleGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FMS::NetworkFirewallPolicyDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->StatefulDefaultActions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The definition of the Network Firewall firewall policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 StatefulDefaultActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The default actions to take on a packet that doesn't match any stateful
rules. The stateful default action is optional, and is only valid when
using the strict rule order.

Valid values of the stateful default action:

=over

=item *

aws:drop_strict

=item *

aws:drop_established

=item *

aws:alert_strict

=item *

aws:alert_established

=back



=head2 StatefulEngineOptions => L<Paws::FMS::StatefulEngineOptions>

Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles stateful
rules. The stateful rule groups that you use in your policy must have
stateful rule options settings that are compatible with these settings.


=head2 StatefulRuleGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FMS::StatefulRuleGroup>]

The stateful rule groups that are used in the Network Firewall firewall
policy.


=head2 StatelessCustomActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Names of custom actions that are available for use in the stateless
default actions settings.


=head2 StatelessDefaultActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to take on packets that don't match any of the stateless
rule groups.


=head2 StatelessFragmentDefaultActions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The actions to take on packet fragments that don't match any of the
stateless rule groups.


=head2 StatelessRuleGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FMS::StatelessRuleGroup>]

The stateless rule groups that are used in the Network Firewall
firewall policy.
