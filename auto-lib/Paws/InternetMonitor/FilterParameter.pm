=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::FilterParameter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::FilterParameter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Field => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::FilterParameter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Field

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter that you use with the results of a Amazon CloudWatch Internet
Monitor query that you created and ran. The query sets up a repository
of data that is a subset of your application's Internet Monitor data.
C<FilterParameter> is a string that defines how you want to filter the
repository of data to return a set of results, based on your criteria.

The filter parameters that you can specify depend on the query type
that you used to create the repository, since each query type returns a
different set of Internet Monitor data.

For each filter, you specify a field (such as C<city>), an operator
(such as C<not_equals>, and a value or array of values (such as
C<["Seattle", "Redmond"]>). Separate values in the array with commas.

For more information about specifying filter parameters, see Using the
Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor query interface
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-view-cw-tools-cwim-query.html)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor User Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Field => Str

A data field that you want to filter, to further scope your
application's Internet Monitor data in a repository that you created by
running a query. A field might be C<city>, for example. The field must
be one of the fields that was returned by the specific query that you
used to create the repository.


=head2 Operator => Str

The operator to use with the filter field and a value, such as
C<not_equals>.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more values to be used, together with the specified operator, to
filter data for a query. For example, you could specify an array of
values such as C<["Seattle", "Redmond"]>. Values in the array are
separated by commas.
