=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::PerformanceMeasurement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::PerformanceMeasurement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExperienceScore => $value, ..., RoundTripTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::PerformanceMeasurement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExperienceScore

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor calculates measurements about the
performance for your application's internet traffic between client
locations and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has substantial
historical data about internet performance and availability between
Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and
geographies. By applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet
Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for your
application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's
already calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, we report
that information to you in the form of health scores: a performance
score and an availability score.

Performance in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage of
traffic that is not seeing a performance drop. For example, a
performance score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing a performance drop for
that pair.

For more information, see How Internet Monitor calculates performance
and availability scores

in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExperienceScore => Num

Experience scores, or health scores, are calculated for different
geographic and network provider combinations (that is, different
granularities) and also totaled into global scores. If you view
performance or availability scores without filtering for any specific
geography or service provider, Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor
provides global health scores.

The Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor chapter in the CloudWatch User
Guide includes detailed information about how Internet Monitor
calculates health scores, including performance and availability
scores, and when it creates and resolves health events. For more
information, see How Amazon Web Services calculates performance and
availability scores
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMExperienceScores)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.


=head2 PercentOfClientLocationImpacted => Num

How much performance impact was caused by a health event at a client
location. For performance, this is the percentage of how much latency
increased during the event compared to typical performance for traffic,
from this client location to an Amazon Web Services location, using a
specific client network.

For more information, see When Amazon Web Services creates and resolves
health events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMHealthEventStartStop)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.


=head2 PercentOfTotalTrafficImpacted => Num

The impact on total traffic that a health event has, in increased
latency or reduced availability. This is the percentage of how much
latency has increased or availability has decreased during the event,
compared to what is typical for traffic from this client location to
the Amazon Web Services location using this client network.

For more information, see When Amazon Web Services creates and resolves
health events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMHealthEventStartStop)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.


=head2 RoundTripTime => L<Paws::InternetMonitor::RoundTripTime>

This is the percentage of how much round-trip time increased during the
event compared to typical round-trip time for your application for
traffic.

For more information, see When Amazon Web Services creates and resolves
health events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMHealthEventStartStop)
