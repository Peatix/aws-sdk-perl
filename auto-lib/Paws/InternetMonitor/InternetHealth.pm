=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::InternetHealth

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::InternetHealth object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Availability => $value, ..., Performance => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::InternetHealth object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Availability

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Internet health includes measurements calculated by Amazon CloudWatch
Internet Monitor about the performance and availability for your
application on the internet. Amazon Web Services has substantial
historical data about internet performance and availability between
Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and
geographies. By applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet
Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for your
application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's
already calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, Internet
Monitor reports the information to you in the form of health scores: a
performance score and an availability score.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Availability => L<Paws::InternetMonitor::AvailabilityMeasurement>

Availability in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage of
traffic that is not seeing an availability drop. For example, an
availability score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing an availability drop for
that pair.

For more information, see How Internet Monitor calculates performance
and availability scores
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMExperienceScores)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.


=head2 Performance => L<Paws::InternetMonitor::PerformanceMeasurement>

Performance in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage of
traffic that is not seeing a performance drop. For example, a
performance score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing a performance drop for
that pair.

and availability scores
