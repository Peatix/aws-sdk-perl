=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEvent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a health event created in a monitor in Amazon
CloudWatch Internet Monitor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

When the health event was created.


=head2 EndedAt => Str

The time when a health event ended. If the health event is still
active, then the end time is not set.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventId => Str

The internally-generated identifier of a specific network traffic
impairment health event.


=head2 HealthScoreThreshold => Num

The value of the threshold percentage for performance or availability
that was configured when Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor created the
health event.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImpactedLocations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::InternetMonitor::ImpactedLocation>]

The locations impacted by the health event.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImpactType => Str

The type of impairment for a health event.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastUpdatedAt => Str

When the health event was last updated.


=head2 PercentOfTotalTrafficImpacted => Num

The impact on total traffic that a health event has, in increased
latency or reduced availability. This is the percentage of how much
latency has increased or availability has decreased during the event,
compared to what is typical for traffic from this client location to
the Amazon Web Services location using this client network.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartedAt => Str

When a health event started.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of a health event.
