=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::LocalHealthEventsConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::LocalHealthEventsConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HealthScoreThreshold => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::LocalHealthEventsConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HealthScoreThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type with the configuration information that determines the
threshold and other conditions for when Internet Monitor creates a
health event for a local performance or availability issue, when scores
cross a threshold for one or more city-networks.

Defines the percentages, for performance scores or availability scores,
that are the local thresholds for when Amazon CloudWatch Internet
Monitor creates a health event. Also defines whether a local threshold
is enabled or disabled, and the minimum percentage of overall traffic
that must be impacted by an issue before Internet Monitor creates an
event when a threshold is crossed for a local health score.

If you don't set a local health event threshold, the default value is
60%.

For more information, see Change health event thresholds
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-overview.html#IMUpdateThresholdFromOverview)
in the Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HealthScoreThreshold => Num

The health event threshold percentage set for a local health score.


=head2 MinTrafficImpact => Num

The minimum percentage of overall traffic for an application that must
be impacted by an issue before Internet Monitor creates an event when a
threshold is crossed for a local health score.

If you don't set a minimum traffic impact threshold, the default value
is 0.1%.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of whether Internet Monitor creates a health event based on
a threshold percentage set for a local health score. The status can be
C<ENABLED> or C<DISABLED>.
