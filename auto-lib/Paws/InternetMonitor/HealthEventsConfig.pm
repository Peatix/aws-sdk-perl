=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEventsConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEventsConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityLocalHealthEventsConfig => $value, ..., PerformanceScoreThreshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::HealthEventsConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityLocalHealthEventsConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type with the configuration information that determines the
threshold and other conditions for when Internet Monitor creates a
health event for an overall performance or availability issue, across
an application's geographies.

Defines the percentages, for overall performance scores and
availability scores for an application, that are the thresholds for
when Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor creates a health event. You can
override the defaults to set a custom threshold for overall performance
or availability scores, or both.

You can also set thresholds for local health scores,, where Internet
Monitor creates a health event when scores cross a threshold for one or
more city-networks, in addition to creating an event when an overall
score crosses a threshold.

If you don't set a health event threshold, the default value is 95%.

For local thresholds, you also set a minimum percentage of overall
traffic that is impacted by an issue before Internet Monitor creates an
event. In addition, you can disable local thresholds, for performance
scores, availability scores, or both.

For more information, see Change health event thresholds
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-overview.html#IMUpdateThresholdFromOverview)
in the Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch User Guide>.
