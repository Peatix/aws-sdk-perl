=head1 NAME

Paws::InternetMonitor::AvailabilityMeasurement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::InternetMonitor::AvailabilityMeasurement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExperienceScore => $value, ..., PercentOfTotalTrafficImpacted => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::InternetMonitor::AvailabilityMeasurement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExperienceScore

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor calculates measurements about the
availability for your application's internet traffic between client
locations and Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has substantial
historical data about internet performance and availability between
Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and
geographies. By applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet
Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for your
application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's
already calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, we report
that information to you in the form of health scores: a performance
score and an availability score.

Availability in Internet Monitor represents the estimated percentage of
traffic that is not seeing an availability drop. For example, an
availability score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is
equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing an availability drop for
that pair.

For more information, see How Internet Monitor calculates performance
and availability scores

in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<Amazon
CloudWatch User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExperienceScore => Num

Experience scores, or health scores are calculated for different
geographic and network provider combinations (that is, different
granularities) and also summed into global scores. If you view
performance or availability scores without filtering for any specific
geography or service provider, Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor
provides global health scores.

The Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor chapter in the I<CloudWatch User
Guide> includes detailed information about how Internet Monitor
calculates health scores, including performance and availability
scores, and when it creates and resolves health events. For more
information, see How Amazon Web Services calculates performance and
availability scores
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMExperienceScores)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the I<CloudWatch
User Guide>.


=head2 PercentOfClientLocationImpacted => Num

The percentage of impact caused by a health event for client location
traffic globally.

For information about how Internet Monitor calculates impact, see
Inside Internet Monitor
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html)
in the Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the Amazon
CloudWatch User Guide.


=head2 PercentOfTotalTrafficImpacted => Num

The impact on total traffic that a health event has, in increased
latency or reduced availability. This is the percentage of how much
latency has increased or availability has decreased during the event,
compared to what is typical for traffic from this client location to
the Amazon Web Services location using this client network.

Internet Monitor works
