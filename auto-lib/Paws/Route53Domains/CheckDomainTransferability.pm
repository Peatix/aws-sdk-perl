=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Domains::CheckDomainTransferability - Arguments for method CheckDomainTransferability on L<Paws::Route53Domains>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CheckDomainTransferability on the
L<Amazon Route 53 Domains|Paws::Route53Domains> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CheckDomainTransferability.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CheckDomainTransferability.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $route53domains = Paws->service('Route53Domains');
    my $CheckDomainTransferabilityResponse =
      $route53domains->CheckDomainTransferability(
      DomainName => 'MyDomainName',
      AuthCode   => 'MyDomainAuthCode',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $Message         = $CheckDomainTransferabilityResponse->Message;
    my $Transferability = $CheckDomainTransferabilityResponse->Transferability;

 # Returns a L<Paws::Route53Domains::CheckDomainTransferabilityResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

the current registrar for the domain.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainName => Str
