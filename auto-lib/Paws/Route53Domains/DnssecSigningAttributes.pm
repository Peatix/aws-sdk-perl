=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecSigningAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecSigningAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., PublicKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecSigningAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a delegation signer (DS) record that was created in
the registry by AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Algorithm => Int

Algorithm which was used to generate the digest from the public key.


=head2 Flags => Int

Defines the type of key. It can be either a KSK (key-signing-key, value
257) or ZSK (zone-signing-key, value 256). Using KSK is always
encouraged. Only use ZSK if your DNS provider isn't Route 53 and you
donE<rsquo>t have KSK available.

If you have KSK and ZSK keys, always use KSK to create a delegations
signer (DS) record. If you have ZSK keys only E<ndash> use ZSK to
create a DS record.


=head2 PublicKey => Str

The base64-encoded public key part of the key pair that is passed to
the registry.
