=head1 NAME

Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., PublicKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Route53Domains::DnssecKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the DNSSEC key.

You get this from your DNS provider and then give it to Route 53 (by
using AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain.html))
to pass it to the registry to establish the chain of trust.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Algorithm => Int

The number of the public keyE<rsquo>s cryptographic algorithm according
to an IANA
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-sec-alg-numbers/dns-sec-alg-numbers.xml)
assignment.

If Route 53 is your DNS service, set this to 13.

For more information about enabling DNSSEC signing, see Enabling DNSSEC
signing and establishing a chain of trust
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring-dnssec-enable-signing.html).


=head2 Digest => Str

The delegation signer digest.

Digest is calculated from the public key provided using specified
digest algorithm and this digest is the actual value returned from the
registry nameservers as the value of DS records.


=head2 DigestType => Int

The number of the DS digest algorithm according to an IANA assignment.

For more information, see IANA
(https://www.iana.org/assignments/ds-rr-types/ds-rr-types.xhtml) for
DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type Digest
Algorithms.


=head2 Flags => Int

Defines the type of key. It can be either a KSK (key-signing-key, value
257) or ZSK (zone-signing-key, value 256). Using KSK is always
encouraged. Only use ZSK if your DNS provider isn't Route 53 and you
donE<rsquo>t have KSK available.

If you have KSK and ZSK keys, always use KSK to create a delegations
signer (DS) record. If you have ZSK keys only E<ndash> use ZSK to
create a DS record.


=head2 Id => Str

An ID assigned to each DS record created by
AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_domains_AssociateDelegationSignerToDomain.html).


=head2 KeyTag => Int

A numeric identification of the DNSKEY record referred to by this DS
record.


=head2 PublicKey => Str

The base64-encoded public key part of the key pair that is passed to
the registry .
