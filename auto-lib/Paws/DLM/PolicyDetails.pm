=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::PolicyDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::PolicyDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actions => $value, ..., TargetTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::PolicyDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the configuration of a lifecycle policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Action>]

B<[Event-based policies only]> The actions to be performed when the
event-based policy is activated. You can specify only one action per
policy.


=head2 CopyTags => Bool

B<[Default policies only]> Indicates whether the policy should copy
tags from the source resource to the snapshot or AMI. If you do not
specify a value, the default is C<false>.

Default: false


=head2 CreateInterval => Int

B<[Default policies only]> Specifies how often the policy should run
and create snapshots or AMIs. The creation frequency can range from 1
to 7 days. If you do not specify a value, the default is 1.

Default: 1


=head2 CrossRegionCopyTargets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyTarget>]

B<[Default policies only]> Specifies destination Regions for snapshot
or AMI copies. You can specify up to 3 destination Regions. If you do
not want to create cross-Region copies, omit this parameter.


=head2 EventSource => L<Paws::DLM::EventSource>

B<[Event-based policies only]> The event that activates the event-based
policy.


=head2 Exclusions => L<Paws::DLM::Exclusions>

B<[Default policies only]> Specifies exclusion parameters for volumes
or instances for which you do not want to create snapshots or AMIs. The
policy will not create snapshots or AMIs for target resources that
match any of the specified exclusion parameters.


=head2 ExtendDeletion => Bool

B<[Default policies only]> Defines the snapshot or AMI retention
behavior for the policy if the source volume or instance is deleted, or
if the policy enters the error, disabled, or deleted state.

By default (B<ExtendDeletion=false>):

=over

=item *

If a source resource is deleted, Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager will
continue to delete previously created snapshots or AMIs, up to but not
including the last one, based on the specified retention period. If you
want Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to delete all snapshots or AMIs,
including the last one, specify C<true>.

=item *

If a policy enters the error, disabled, or deleted state, Amazon Data
Lifecycle Manager stops deleting snapshots and AMIs. If you want Amazon
Data Lifecycle Manager to continue deleting snapshots or AMIs,
including the last one, if the policy enters one of these states,
specify C<true>.

=back

If you enable extended deletion (B<ExtendDeletion=true>), you override
both default behaviors simultaneously.

If you do not specify a value, the default is C<false>.

Default: false


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::DLM::Parameters>

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> A set of optional parameters
for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies.

If you are modifying a policy that was created or previously modified
using the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager console, then you must include
this parameter and specify either the default values or the new values
that you require. You can't omit this parameter or set its values to
null.


=head2 PolicyLanguage => Str

The type of policy to create. Specify one of the following:

=over

=item *

C<SIMPLIFIED> To create a default policy.

=item *

C<STANDARD> To create a custom policy.

=back



=head2 PolicyType => Str

The type of policy. Specify C<EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT> to create a
lifecycle policy that manages the lifecycle of Amazon EBS snapshots.
Specify C<IMAGE_MANAGEMENT> to create a lifecycle policy that manages
the lifecycle of EBS-backed AMIs. Specify C<EVENT_BASED_POLICY > to
create an event-based policy that performs specific actions when a
defined event occurs in your Amazon Web Services account.

The default is C<EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT>.


=head2 ResourceLocations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> The location of the
resources to backup.

=over

=item *

If the source resources are located in a Region, specify C<CLOUD>. In
this case, the policy targets all resources of the specified type with
matching target tags across all Availability Zones in the Region.

=item *

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> If the source resources are located
in a Local Zone, specify C<LOCAL_ZONE>. In this case, the policy
targets all resources of the specified type with matching target tags
across all Local Zones in the Region.

=item *

If the source resources are located on an Outpost in your account,
specify C<OUTPOST>. In this case, the policy targets all resources of
the specified type with matching target tags across all of the Outposts
in your account.

=back



=head2 ResourceType => Str

B<[Default policies only]> Specify the type of default policy to
create.

=over

=item *

To create a default policy for EBS snapshots, that creates snapshots of
all volumes in the Region that do not have recent backups, specify
C<VOLUME>.

=item *

To create a default policy for EBS-backed AMIs, that creates EBS-backed
AMIs from all instances in the Region that do not have recent backups,
specify C<INSTANCE>.

=back



=head2 ResourceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> The target resource type for
snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies. Use C<VOLUME >to create snapshots
of individual volumes or use C<INSTANCE> to create multi-volume
snapshots from the volumes for an instance.


=head2 RetainInterval => Int

B<[Default policies only]> Specifies how long the policy should retain
snapshots or AMIs before deleting them. The retention period can range
from 2 to 14 days, but it must be greater than the creation frequency
to ensure that the policy retains at least 1 snapshot or AMI at any
given time. If you do not specify a value, the default is 7.

Default: 7


=head2 Schedules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Schedule>]

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> The schedules of
policy-defined actions for snapshot and AMI lifecycle policies. A
policy can have up to four schedulesE<mdash>one mandatory schedule and
up to three optional schedules.


=head2 TargetTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> The single tag that
identifies targeted resources for this policy.
