=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::Parameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::Parameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ExcludeBootVolume => $value, ..., NoReboot => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::Parameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ExcludeBootVolume

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> Specifies optional
parameters for snapshot and AMI policies. The set of valid parameters
depends on the combination of policy type and target resource type.

If you choose to exclude boot volumes and you specify tags that
consequently exclude all of the additional data volumes attached to an
instance, then Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager will not create any
snapshots for the affected instance, and it will emit a
C<SnapshotsCreateFailed> Amazon CloudWatch metric. For more
information, see Monitor your policies using Amazon CloudWatch
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitor-dlm-cw-metrics.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ExcludeBootVolume => Bool

B<[Custom snapshot policies that target instances only]> Indicates
whether to exclude the root volume from multi-volume snapshot sets. The
default is C<false>. If you specify C<true>, then the root volumes
attached to targeted instances will be excluded from the multi-volume
snapshot sets created by the policy.


=head2 ExcludeDataVolumeTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

B<[Custom snapshot policies that target instances only]> The tags used
to identify data (non-root) volumes to exclude from multi-volume
snapshot sets.

If you create a snapshot lifecycle policy that targets instances and
you specify tags for this parameter, then data volumes with the
specified tags that are attached to targeted instances will be excluded
from the multi-volume snapshot sets created by the policy.


=head2 NoReboot => Bool

B<[Custom AMI policies only]> Indicates whether targeted instances are
rebooted when the lifecycle policy runs. C<true> indicates that
targeted instances are not rebooted when the policy runs. C<false>
indicates that target instances are rebooted when the policy runs. The
default is C<true> (instances are not rebooted).
