=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::EventParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::EventParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DescriptionRegex => $value, ..., SnapshotOwner => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::EventParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DescriptionRegex

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Event-based policies only]> Specifies an event that activates an
event-based policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DescriptionRegex => Str

The snapshot description that can trigger the policy. The description
pattern is specified using a regular expression. The policy runs only
if a snapshot with a description that matches the specified pattern is
shared with your account.

For example, specifying C<^.*Created for policy:
policy-1234567890abcdef0.*$> configures the policy to run only if
snapshots created by policy C<policy-1234567890abcdef0> are shared with
your account.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventType => Str

The type of event. Currently, only snapshot sharing events are
supported.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SnapshotOwner => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that can trigger policy by
sharing snapshots with your account. The policy only runs if one of the
specified Amazon Web Services accounts shares a snapshot with your
account.
