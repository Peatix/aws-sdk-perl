=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CmkArn => $value, ..., TargetRegion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CmkArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> Specifies a cross-Region
copy rule for a snapshot and AMI policies.

To specify a cross-Region copy action for event-based polices, use
CrossRegionCopyAction
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_CrossRegionCopyAction.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CmkArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to use for EBS
encryption. If this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for
the account is used.


=head2 CopyTags => Bool

Indicates whether to copy all user-defined tags from the source
snapshot or AMI to the cross-Region copy.


=head2 DeprecateRule => L<Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyDeprecateRule>

B<[Custom AMI policies only]> The AMI deprecation rule for cross-Region
AMI copies created by the rule.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Encrypted => Bool

To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if encryption by default
is not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Copies of
encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if this parameter is false or
if encryption by default is not enabled.


=head2 RetainRule => L<Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRetainRule>

The retention rule that indicates how long the cross-Region snapshot or
AMI copies are to be retained in the destination Region.


=head2 Target => Str

Use this parameter for snapshot policies only. For AMI policies, use
B<TargetRegion> instead.

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> The target Region or the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) of the target Outpost for the snapshot copies.


=head2 TargetRegion => Str

Use this parameter for AMI policies only. For snapshot policies, use
B<Target> instead. For snapshot policies created before the B<Target>
parameter was introduced, this parameter indicates the target Region
for snapshot copies.

B<[Custom AMI policies only]> The target Region or the Amazon Resource
Name (ARN) of the target Outpost for the snapshot copies.
