=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::RetentionArchiveTier

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::RetentionArchiveTier object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., IntervalUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::RetentionArchiveTier object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> Describes the retention rule for
archived snapshots. Once the archive retention threshold is met, the
snapshots are permanently deleted from the archive tier.

The archive retention rule must retain snapshots in the archive tier
for a minimum of 90 days.

For B<count-based schedules>, you must specify B<Count>. For
B<age-based schedules>, you must specify B<Interval> and B<
IntervalUnit>.

For more information about using snapshot archiving, see Considerations
for snapshot lifecycle policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-ami-policy.html#dlm-archive).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => Int

The maximum number of snapshots to retain in the archive storage tier
for each volume. The count must ensure that each snapshot remains in
the archive tier for at least 90 days. For example, if the schedule
creates snapshots every 30 days, you must specify a count of 3 or more
to ensure that each snapshot is archived for at least 90 days.


=head2 Interval => Int

Specifies the period of time to retain snapshots in the archive tier.
After this period expires, the snapshot is permanently deleted.


=head2 IntervalUnit => Str

The unit of time in which to measure the B<Interval>. For example, to
retain a snapshots in the archive tier for 6 months, specify
C<Interval=6> and C<IntervalUnit=MONTHS>.
