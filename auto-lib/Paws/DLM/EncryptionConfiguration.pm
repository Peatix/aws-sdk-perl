=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::EncryptionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CmkArn => $value, ..., Encrypted => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CmkArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Event-based policies only]> Specifies the encryption settings for
cross-Region snapshot copies created by event-based policies.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CmkArn => Str

encryption. If this parameter is not specified, the default KMS key for
the account is used.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Encrypted => Bool

To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot when encryption by default
is not enabled, enable encryption using this parameter. Copies of
encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if this parameter is false or
