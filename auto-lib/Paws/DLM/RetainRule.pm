=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::RetainRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::RetainRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., IntervalUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::RetainRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> Specifies a retention rule
for snapshots created by snapshot policies, or for AMIs created by AMI
policies.

For snapshot policies that have an ArchiveRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ArchiveRule.html),
this retention rule applies to standard tier retention. When the
retention threshold is met, snapshots are moved from the standard to
the archive tier.

For snapshot policies that do not have an B<ArchiveRule>, snapshots are
permanently deleted when this retention threshold is met.

You can retain snapshots based on either a count or a time interval.

=item *

B<Count-based retention>

You must specify B<Count>. If you specify an ArchiveRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ArchiveRule.html)
for the schedule, then you can specify a retention count of C<0> to
archive snapshots immediately after creation. If you specify a
FastRestoreRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_FastRestoreRule.html),
ShareRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ShareRule.html),
or a CrossRegionCopyRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_CrossRegionCopyRule.html),
then you must specify a retention count of C<1> or more.

=item *

B<Age-based retention>

You must specify B<Interval> and B<IntervalUnit>. If you specify an
ArchiveRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ArchiveRule.html)
for the schedule, then you can specify a retention interval of C<0>
days to archive snapshots immediately after creation. If you specify a
FastRestoreRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_FastRestoreRule.html),
ShareRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ShareRule.html),
or a CrossRegionCopyRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_CrossRegionCopyRule.html),
then you must specify a retention interval of C<1> day or more.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => Int

The number of snapshots to retain for each volume, up to a maximum of
1000. For example if you want to retain a maximum of three snapshots,
specify C<3>. When the fourth snapshot is created, the oldest retained
snapshot is deleted, or it is moved to the archive tier if you have
specified an ArchiveRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ArchiveRule.html).


=head2 Interval => Int

The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The maximum is 100 years.
This is equivalent to 1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.


=head2 IntervalUnit => Str

The unit of time for time-based retention. For example, to retain
snapshots for 3 months, specify C<Interval=3> and
C<IntervalUnit=MONTHS>. Once the snapshot has been retained for 3
months, it is deleted, or it is moved to the archive tier if you have
specified an ArchiveRule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlm/latest/APIReference/API_ArchiveRule.html).
