=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::DeprecateRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::DeprecateRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., IntervalUnit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::DeprecateRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom AMI policies only]> Specifies an AMI deprecation rule for
AMIs created by an AMI lifecycle policy.

For age-based schedules, you must specify B<Interval> and
B<IntervalUnit>. For count-based schedules, you must specify B<Count>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => Int

If the schedule has a count-based retention rule, this parameter
specifies the number of oldest AMIs to deprecate. The count must be
less than or equal to the schedule's retention count, and it can't be
greater than 1000.


=head2 Interval => Int

If the schedule has an age-based retention rule, this parameter
specifies the period after which to deprecate AMIs created by the
schedule. The period must be less than or equal to the schedule's
retention period, and it can't be greater than 10 years. This is
equivalent to 120 months, 520 weeks, or 3650 days.


=head2 IntervalUnit => Str

The unit of time in which to measure the B<Interval>.
