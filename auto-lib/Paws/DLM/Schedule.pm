=head1 NAME

Paws::DLM::Schedule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DLM::Schedule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ArchiveRule => $value, ..., VariableTags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DLM::Schedule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ArchiveRule

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<[Custom snapshot and AMI policies only]> Specifies a schedule for a
snapshot or AMI lifecycle policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ArchiveRule => L<Paws::DLM::ArchiveRule>

B<[Custom snapshot policies that target volumes only]> The snapshot
archiving rule for the schedule. When you specify an archiving rule,
snapshots are automatically moved from the standard tier to the archive
tier once the schedule's retention threshold is met. Snapshots are then
retained in the archive tier for the archive retention period that you
specify.

For more information about using snapshot archiving, see Considerations
for snapshot lifecycle policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/snapshot-ami-policy.html#dlm-archive).


=head2 CopyTags => Bool

Copy all user-defined tags on a source volume to snapshots of the
volume created by this policy.


=head2 CreateRule => L<Paws::DLM::CreateRule>

The creation rule.


=head2 CrossRegionCopyRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::CrossRegionCopyRule>]

Specifies a rule for copying snapshots or AMIs across Regions.

You can't specify cross-Region copy rules for policies that create
snapshots on an Outpost or in a Local Zone. If the policy creates
snapshots in a Region, then snapshots can be copied to up to three
Regions or Outposts.


=head2 DeprecateRule => L<Paws::DLM::DeprecateRule>

B<[Custom AMI policies only]> The AMI deprecation rule for the
schedule.


=head2 FastRestoreRule => L<Paws::DLM::FastRestoreRule>

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> The rule for enabling fast snapshot
restore.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the schedule.


=head2 RetainRule => L<Paws::DLM::RetainRule>

The retention rule for snapshots or AMIs created by the policy.


=head2 ShareRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::ShareRule>]

B<[Custom snapshot policies only]> The rule for sharing snapshots with
other Amazon Web Services accounts.


=head2 TagsToAdd => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

The tags to apply to policy-created resources. These user-defined tags
are in addition to the Amazon Web Services-added lifecycle tags.


=head2 VariableTags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::DLM::Tag>]

B<[AMI policies and snapshot policies that target instances only]> A
collection of key/value pairs with values determined dynamically when
the policy is executed. Keys may be any valid Amazon EC2 tag key.
Values must be in one of the two following formats: C<$(instance-id)>
or C<$(timestamp)>. Variable tags are only valid for EBS Snapshot
Management E<ndash> Instance policies.
