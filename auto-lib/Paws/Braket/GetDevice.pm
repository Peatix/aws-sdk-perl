=head1 NAME

Paws::Braket::GetDevice - Arguments for method GetDevice on L<Paws::Braket>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetDevice on the
L<Braket|Paws::Braket> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetDevice.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetDevice.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $braket = Paws->service('Braket');
    my $GetDeviceResponse = $braket->GetDevice(
      DeviceArn => 'MyDeviceArn',

    );

    # Results:
    my $DeviceArn          = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceArn;
    my $DeviceCapabilities = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceCapabilities;
    my $DeviceName         = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceName;
    my $DeviceQueueInfo    = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceQueueInfo;
    my $DeviceStatus       = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceStatus;
    my $DeviceType         = $GetDeviceResponse->DeviceType;
    my $ProviderName       = $GetDeviceResponse->ProviderName;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Braket::GetDeviceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/braket/GetDevice>
