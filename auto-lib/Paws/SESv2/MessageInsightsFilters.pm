=head1 NAME

Paws::SESv2::MessageInsightsFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::MessageInsightsFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Subject => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::MessageInsightsFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object containing Message Insights filters.

If you specify multiple filters, the filters are joined by AND.

If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are joined by
OR. Filter values are case-sensitive.

C<FromEmailAddress>, C<Destination>, and C<Subject> filters support
partial match. A partial match is performed by using the C<*> wildcard
character placed at the beginning (suffix match), the end (prefix
match) or both ends of the string (contains match). In order to match
the literal characters C<*> or C<\>, they must be escaped using the
C<\> character. If no wildcard character is present, an exact match is
performed.
