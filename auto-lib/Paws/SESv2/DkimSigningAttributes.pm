=head1 NAME

Paws::SESv2::DkimSigningAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::DkimSigningAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DomainSigningAttributesOrigin => $value, ..., NextSigningKeyLength => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::DkimSigningAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DomainSigningAttributesOrigin

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that contains configuration for Bring Your Own DKIM
(BYODKIM), or, for Easy DKIM

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DomainSigningAttributesOrigin => Str

The attribute to use for configuring DKIM for the identity depends on
the operation:

=over

=item 1.

For C<PutEmailIdentityDkimSigningAttributes>:

=over

=item *

None of the values are allowed - use the C<SigningAttributesOrigin>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference-V2/API_PutEmailIdentityDkimSigningAttributes.html#SES-PutEmailIdentityDkimSigningAttributes-request-SigningAttributesOrigin)
parameter instead

=back

=item 2.

For C<CreateEmailIdentity> when replicating a parent identity's DKIM
configuration:

=over

=item *

Allowed values: All values except C<AWS_SES> and C<EXTERNAL>

=head2 DomainSigningPrivateKey => Str

[Bring Your Own DKIM] A private key that's used to generate a DKIM
signature.

The private key must use 1024 or 2048-bit RSA encryption, and must be
encoded using base64 encoding.


=head2 DomainSigningSelector => Str

[Bring Your Own DKIM] A string that's used to identify a public key in
the DNS configuration for a domain.


=head2 NextSigningKeyLength => Str

[Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM key pair to be generated.
This can be changed at most once per day.
