=head1 NAME

Paws::SESv2::VerificationInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::VerificationInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorType => $value, ..., SOARecord => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::VerificationInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that contains additional information about the verification
status for the identity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorType => Str

Provides the reason for the failure describing why Amazon SES was not
able to successfully verify the identity. Below are the possible
values:

=over

=item *

C<INVALID_VALUE> E<ndash> Amazon SES was able to find the record, but
the value contained within the record was invalid. Ensure you have
published the correct values for the record.

=item *

C<TYPE_NOT_FOUND> E<ndash> The queried hostname exists but does not
have the requested type of DNS record. Ensure that you have published
the correct type of DNS record.

=item *

C<HOST_NOT_FOUND> E<ndash> The queried hostname does not exist or was
not reachable at the time of the request. Ensure that you have
published the required DNS record(s).

=item *

C<SERVICE_ERROR> E<ndash> A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES
from determining the verification status of the domain.

=item *

C<DNS_SERVER_ERROR> E<ndash> The DNS server encountered an issue and
was unable to complete the request.

=item *

C<REPLICATION_ACCESS_DENIED> E<ndash> The verification failed because
the user does not have the required permissions to replicate the DKIM
key from the primary region. Ensure you have the necessary permissions
in both primary and replica regions.

=item *

C<REPLICATION_PRIMARY_NOT_FOUND> E<ndash> The verification failed
because no corresponding identity was found in the specified primary
region. Ensure the identity exists in the primary region before
attempting replication.

=item *

C<REPLICATION_PRIMARY_BYO_DKIM_NOT_SUPPORTED> E<ndash> The verification
failed because the identity in the primary region is configured with
Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). DKIM key replication is only supported
for identities using Easy DKIM.

=item *

C<REPLICATION_REPLICA_AS_PRIMARY_NOT_SUPPORTED> E<ndash> The
verification failed because the specified primary identity is a replica
of another identity, and multi-level replication is not supported; the
primary identity must be a non-replica identity.

=item *

C<REPLICATION_PRIMARY_INVALID_REGION> E<ndash> The verification failed
due to an invalid primary region specified. Ensure you provide a valid
Amazon Web Services region where Amazon SES is available and different
from the replica region.

=back



=head2 LastCheckedTimestamp => Str

The last time a verification attempt was made for this identity.


=head2 LastSuccessTimestamp => Str

The last time a successful verification was made for this identity.


=head2 SOARecord => L<Paws::SESv2::SOARecord>

An object that contains information about the start of authority (SOA)
record associated with the identity.
