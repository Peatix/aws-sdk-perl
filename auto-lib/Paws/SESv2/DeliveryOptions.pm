Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::DeliveryOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxDeliverySeconds => $value, ..., TlsPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::DeliveryOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxDeliverySeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Used to associate a configuration set with a dedicated IP pool.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxDeliverySeconds => Int

The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon SES API v2 will

equal to 300 seconds (5 minutes) and less than or equal to 50400
seconds (840 minutes).


=head2 SendingPoolName => Str

The name of the dedicated IP pool to associate with the configuration
set.


=head2 TlsPolicy => Str
