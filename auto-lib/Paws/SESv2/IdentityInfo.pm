=head1 NAME

Paws::SESv2::IdentityInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::IdentityInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IdentityName => $value, ..., VerificationStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::IdentityInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IdentityName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an email identity.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IdentityName => Str

The address or domain of the identity.


=head2 IdentityType => Str

The email identity type. Note: the C<MANAGED_DOMAIN> type is not
supported for email identity types.


=head2 SendingEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether or not you can send email from the identity.

An I<identity> is an email address or domain that you send email from.
Before you can send email from an identity, you have to demostrate that
you own the identity, and that you authorize Amazon SES to send email
from that identity.


=head2 VerificationStatus => Str

The verification status of the identity. The status can be one of the
following:

=over

=item *

C<PENDING> E<ndash> The verification process was initiated, but Amazon
SES hasn't yet been able to verify the identity.

=item *

C<SUCCESS> E<ndash> The verification process completed successfully.

=item *

C<FAILED> E<ndash> The verification process failed.

=item *

C<TEMPORARY_FAILURE> E<ndash> A temporary issue is preventing Amazon
SES from determining the verification status of the identity.

=item *

C<NOT_STARTED> E<ndash> The verification process hasn't been initiated
for the identity.
