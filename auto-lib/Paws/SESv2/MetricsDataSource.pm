=head1 NAME

Paws::SESv2::MetricsDataSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SESv2::MetricsDataSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., StartDate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SESv2::MetricsDataSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that contains details about the data source for the metrics
export.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Dimensions => L<Paws::SESv2::ExportDimensions>

An object that contains a mapping between a C<MetricDimensionName> and
C<MetricDimensionValue> to filter metrics by. Must contain a least 1
dimension but no more than 3 unique ones.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EndDate => Str

Represents the end date for the export interval as a timestamp.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SESv2::ExportMetric>]

A list of C<ExportMetric> objects to export.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Namespace => Str

The metrics namespace - e.g., C<VDM>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartDate => Str

Represents the start date for the export interval as a timestamp.
