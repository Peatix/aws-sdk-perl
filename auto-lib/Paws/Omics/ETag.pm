=head1 NAME

Paws::Omics::ETag

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Omics::ETag object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., Source2 => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Omics::ETag object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The entity tag (ETag) is a hash of the object representing its semantic
content.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Algorithm => Str

The algorithm used to calculate the read setE<rsquo>s ETag(s).


=head2 Source1 => Str

The ETag hash calculated on Source1 of the read set.


=head2 Source2 => Str

The ETag hash calculated on Source2 of the read set.
