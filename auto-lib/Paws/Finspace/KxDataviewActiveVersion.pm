=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewActiveVersion

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewActiveVersion object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttachedClusters => $value, ..., VersionId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewActiveVersion object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttachedClusters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The active version of the dataview that is currently in use by this
cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttachedClusters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of clusters that are currently using this dataview.


=head2 ChangesetId => Str

A unique identifier for the changeset.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp at which the dataview version was active. The value is
determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 SegmentConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewSegmentConfiguration>]

The configuration that contains the database path of the data that you
want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have a unique
database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly specify any
database path for a volume, they are accessible from the cluster
through the default S3/object store segment.


=head2 VersionId => Str

A unique identifier of the active version.
