=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewListEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewListEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveVersions => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewListEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveVersions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of kdb dataview entries.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActiveVersions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewActiveVersion>]

The active changeset versions for the given dataview entry.


=head2 AutoUpdate => Bool

The option to specify whether you want to apply all the future
additions and corrections automatically to the dataview when you ingest
new changesets. The default value is false.


=head2 AvailabilityZoneId => Str

The identifier of the availability zones.


=head2 AzMode => Str

The number of availability zones you want to assign per volume.
Currently, FinSpace only supports C<SINGLE> for volumes. This places
dataview in a single AZ.


=head2 ChangesetId => Str

A unique identifier for the changeset.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp at which the dataview list entry was created in FinSpace.
The value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the
value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as
1635768000000.


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

A unique identifier of the database.


=head2 DataviewName => Str

A unique identifier of the dataview.


=head2 Description => Str

A description for the dataview list entry.


=head2 EnvironmentId => Str

A unique identifier for the kdb environment.


=head2 LastModifiedTimestamp => Str

The last time that the dataview list was updated in FinSpace. The value
is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 ReadWrite => Bool

Returns True if the dataview is created as writeable and False
otherwise.


=head2 SegmentConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewSegmentConfiguration>]

The configuration that contains the database path of the data that you
want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have a unique
database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly specify any
database path for a volume, they are accessible from the cluster
through the default S3/object store segment.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of a given dataview entry.


=head2 StatusReason => Str

The error message when a failed state occurs.
