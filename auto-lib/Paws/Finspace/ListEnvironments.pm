=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::ListEnvironments - Arguments for method ListEnvironments on L<Paws::Finspace>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListEnvironments on the
L<FinSpace User Environment Management service|Paws::Finspace> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListEnvironments.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListEnvironments.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $finspace = Paws->service('Finspace');
    my $ListEnvironmentsResponse = $finspace->ListEnvironments(
      MaxResults => 1,                      # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyPaginationToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Environments = $ListEnvironmentsResponse->Environments;
    my $NextToken    = $ListEnvironmentsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Finspace::ListEnvironmentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/finspace/ListEnvironments>
