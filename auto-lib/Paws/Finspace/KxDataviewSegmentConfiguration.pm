=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewSegmentConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewSegmentConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DbPaths => $value, ..., VolumeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Finspace::KxDataviewSegmentConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DbPaths

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration that contains the database path of the data that you
want to place on each selected volume. Each segment must have a unique
database path for each volume. If you do not explicitly specify any
database path for a volume, they are accessible from the cluster
through the default S3/object store segment.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DbPaths => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The database path of the data that you want to place on each selected
volume for the segment. Each segment must have a unique database path
for each volume.


=head2 OnDemand => Bool

Enables on-demand caching on the selected database path when a
particular file or a column of the database is accessed. When on demand
caching is B<True>, dataviews perform minimal loading of files on the
filesystem as needed. When it is set to B<False>, everything is cached.
The default value is B<False>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VolumeName => Str

The name of the volume where you want to add data.
