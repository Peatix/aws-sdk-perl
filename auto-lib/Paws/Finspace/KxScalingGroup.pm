=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::KxScalingGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Finspace::KxScalingGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZoneId => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Finspace::KxScalingGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZoneId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure for storing metadata of scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZoneId => Str

The identifier of the availability zones.


=head2 Clusters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of clusters currently active in a given scaling group.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp at which the scaling group was created in FinSpace. The
value is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the
value for Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as
1635768000000.


=head2 HostType => Str

The memory and CPU capabilities of the scaling group host on which
FinSpace Managed kdb clusters will be placed.

You can add one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<kx.sg.large> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 16 GiB
memory and 2 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 32 GiB
memory and 4 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.2xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 64 GiB
memory and 8 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.4xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 108 GiB
memory and 16 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.8xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 216 GiB
memory and 32 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.16xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 432
GiB memory and 64 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg.32xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 864
GiB memory and 128 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg1.16xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 1949
GiB memory and 64 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.sg1.24xlarge> E<ndash> The host type with a configuration of 2948
GiB memory and 96 vCPUs.

=back



=head2 LastModifiedTimestamp => Str

The last time that the scaling group was updated in FinSpace. The value
is determined as epoch time in milliseconds. For example, the value for
Monday, November 1, 2021 12:00:00 PM UTC is specified as 1635768000000.


=head2 ScalingGroupName => Str

A unique identifier for the kdb scaling group.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of scaling groups.


=head2 StatusReason => Str

The error message when a failed state occurs.
