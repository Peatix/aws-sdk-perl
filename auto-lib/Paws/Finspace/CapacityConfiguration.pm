=head1 NAME

Paws::Finspace::CapacityConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Finspace::CapacityConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NodeCount => $value, ..., NodeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Finspace::CapacityConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->NodeCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure for the metadata of a cluster. It includes information like
the CPUs needed, memory of instances, and number of instances.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 NodeCount => Int

The number of instances running in a cluster.


=head2 NodeType => Str

The type that determines the hardware of the host computer used for
your cluster instance. Each node type offers different memory and
storage capabilities. Choose a node type based on the requirements of
the application or software that you plan to run on your instance.

You can only specify one of the following values:

=over

=item *

C<kx.s.large> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 12 GiB
memory and 2 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 27 GiB
memory and 4 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.2xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 54 GiB
memory and 8 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.4xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 108 GiB
memory and 16 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.8xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 216 GiB
memory and 32 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.16xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 432 GiB
memory and 64 vCPUs.

=item *

C<kx.s.32xlarge> E<ndash> The node type with a configuration of 864 GiB
memory and 128 vCPUs.
