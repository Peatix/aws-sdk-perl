=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GuardrailConfiguration => $value, ..., SourceConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GuardrailConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for a prompt node in the flow. You can use a
prompt from Prompt management or you can define one in this node. If
the prompt contains variables, the inputs into this node will fill in
the variables. The output from this node is the response generated by
the model. For more information, see Node types in a flow
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/flows-nodes.html)
in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.
