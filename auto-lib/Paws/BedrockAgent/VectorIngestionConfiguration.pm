=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorIngestionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorIngestionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChunkingConfiguration => $value, ..., ParsingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorIngestionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChunkingConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains details about how to ingest the documents in a data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::ChunkingConfiguration>

Details about how to chunk the documents in the data source. A I<chunk>
refers to an excerpt from a data source that is returned when the
knowledge base that it belongs to is queried.


=head2 ContextEnrichmentConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::ContextEnrichmentConfiguration>

The context enrichment configuration used for ingestion of the data
into the vector store.


=head2 CustomTransformationConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::CustomTransformationConfiguration>

A custom document transformer for parsed data source documents.


=head2 ParsingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::ParsingConfiguration>

Configurations for a parser to use for parsing documents in your data
source. If you exclude this field, the default parser will be used.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::BedrockAgent>
