=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LevelConfigurations => $value, ..., OverlapTokens => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LevelConfigurations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for hierarchical document chunking for a data source.
Hierarchical chunking splits documents into layers of chunks where the
first layer contains large chunks, and the second layer contains
smaller chunks derived from the first layer.

You configure the number of tokens to overlap, or repeat across
adjacent chunks. For example, if you set overlap tokens to 60, the last
60 tokens in the first chunk are also included at the beginning of the
second chunk. For each layer, you must also configure the maximum
number of tokens in a chunk.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LevelConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgent::HierarchicalChunkingLevelConfiguration>]

Token settings for each layer.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OverlapTokens => Int

The number of tokens to repeat across chunks in the same layer.
