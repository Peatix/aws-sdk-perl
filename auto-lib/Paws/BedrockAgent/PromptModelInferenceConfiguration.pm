=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptModelInferenceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptModelInferenceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxTokens => $value, ..., TopP => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptModelInferenceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxTokens

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains inference configurations related to model inference for a
prompt. For more information, see Inference parameters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-parameters.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxTokens => Int

The maximum number of tokens to return in the response.


=head2 StopSequences => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of strings that define sequences after which the model will stop
generating.


=head2 Temperature => Num

Controls the randomness of the response. Choose a lower value for more
predictable outputs and a higher value for more surprising outputs.


=head2 TopP => Num

The percentage of most-likely candidates that the model considers for
the next token.



=head1 SEE ALSO
