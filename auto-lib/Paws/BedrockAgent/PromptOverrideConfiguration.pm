=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptOverrideConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptOverrideConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OverrideLambda => $value, ..., PromptConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptOverrideConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OverrideLambda

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations to override prompts in different parts of an
agent sequence. For more information, see Advanced prompts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/advanced-prompts.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OverrideLambda => Str

The ARN of the Lambda function to use when parsing the raw foundation
model output in parts of the agent sequence. If you specify this field,
at least one of the C<promptConfigurations> must contain a
C<parserMode> value that is set to C<OVERRIDDEN>. For more information,
see Parser Lambda function in Amazon Bedrock Agents
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/lambda-parser.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PromptConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptConfiguration>]

Contains configurations to override a prompt template in one part of an
agent sequence. For more information, see Advanced prompts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/advanced-prompts.html).
