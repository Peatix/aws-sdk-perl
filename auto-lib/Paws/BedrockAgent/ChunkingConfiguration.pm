=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::ChunkingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::ChunkingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChunkingStrategy => $value, ..., SemanticChunkingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::ChunkingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChunkingStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details about how to chunk the documents in the data source. A I<chunk>
refers to an excerpt from a data source that is returned when the
knowledge base that it belongs to is queried.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ChunkingStrategy => Str

Knowledge base can split your source data into chunks. A I<chunk>
refers to an excerpt from a data source that is returned when the
knowledge base that it belongs to is queried. You have the following
options for chunking your data. If you opt for C<NONE>, then you may
want to pre-process your files by splitting them up such that each file
corresponds to a chunk.

=over

=item *

C<FIXED_SIZE> E<ndash> Amazon Bedrock splits your source data into
chunks of the approximate size that you set in the
C<fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration>.

=item *

C<HIERARCHICAL> E<ndash> Split documents into layers of chunks where
the first layer contains large chunks, and the second layer contains
smaller chunks derived from the first layer.

=item *

C<SEMANTIC> E<ndash> Split documents into chunks based on groups of
similar content derived with natural language processing.

=item *

C<NONE> E<ndash> Amazon Bedrock treats each file as one chunk. If you
choose this option, you may want to pre-process your documents by
splitting them into separate files.

=head2 FixedSizeChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::FixedSizeChunkingConfiguration>

Configurations for when you choose fixed-size chunking. If you set the
C<chunkingStrategy> as C<NONE>, exclude this field.


=head2 HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::HierarchicalChunkingConfiguration>

Settings for hierarchical document chunking for a data source.
Hierarchical chunking splits documents into layers of chunks where the
first layer contains large chunks, and the second layer contains
smaller chunks derived from the first layer.


=head2 SemanticChunkingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::SemanticChunkingConfiguration>

Settings for semantic document chunking for a data source. Semantic
chunking splits a document into into smaller documents based on groups
of similar content derived from the text with natural language
processing.
