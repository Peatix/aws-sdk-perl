=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopControllerFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopControllerFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContinueCondition => $value, ..., MaxIterations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopControllerFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContinueCondition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for the controller node of a DoWhile loop in
the flow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ContinueCondition => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::FlowCondition>

Specifies the condition that determines when the flow exits the DoWhile
loop. The loop executes until this condition evaluates to true.


=head2 MaxIterations => Int

Specifies the maximum number of times the DoWhile loop can iterate
before the flow exits the loop.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::BedrockAgent>
