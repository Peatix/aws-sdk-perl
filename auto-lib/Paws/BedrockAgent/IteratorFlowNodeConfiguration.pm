=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::IteratorFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::IteratorFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => {  => $value, ...,  => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::IteratorFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for an iterator node in a flow. Takes an input
that is an array and iteratively sends each item of the array as an
output to the following node. The size of the array is also returned in
the output.

The output flow node at the end of the flow iteration will return a
response for each member of the array. To return only one response, you
can include a collector node downstream from the iterator node.
