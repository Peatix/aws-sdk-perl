=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::WebCrawlerConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::WebCrawlerConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CrawlerLimits => $value, ..., UserAgentHeader => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::WebCrawlerConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CrawlerLimits

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration of web URLs that you want to crawl. You should be
authorized to crawl the URLs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CrawlerLimits => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::WebCrawlerLimits>

The configuration of crawl limits for the web URLs.


=head2 ExclusionFilters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of one or more exclusion regular expression patterns to exclude
certain URLs. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter/pattern
and both match a URL, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the web
content of the URL isnE<rsquo>t crawled.


=head2 InclusionFilters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of one or more inclusion regular expression patterns to include
certain URLs. If you specify an inclusion and exclusion filter/pattern
and both match a URL, the exclusion filter takes precedence and the web
content of the URL isnE<rsquo>t crawled.


=head2 Scope => Str

The scope of what is crawled for your URLs.

You can choose to crawl only web pages that belong to the same host or
primary domain. For example, only web pages that contain the seed URL
"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/" and no other
domains. You can choose to include sub domains in addition to the host
or primary domain. For example, web pages that contain "aws.amazon.com"
can also include sub domain "docs.aws.amazon.com".


=head2 UserAgent => Str

Returns the user agent suffix for your web crawler.


=head2 UserAgentHeader => Str

A string used for identifying the crawler or bot when it accesses a web
server. The user agent header value consists of the C<bedrockbot>,
UUID, and a user agent suffix for your crawler (if one is provided). By
default, it is set to C<bedrockbot_UUID>. You can optionally append a
custom suffix to C<bedrockbot_UUID> to allowlist a specific user agent
permitted to access your source URLs.
