=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::BedrockEmbeddingModelConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::BedrockEmbeddingModelConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., EmbeddingDataType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::BedrockEmbeddingModelConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vector configuration details for the Bedrock embeddings model.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => Int

The dimensions details for the vector configuration used on the Bedrock
embeddings model.


=head2 EmbeddingDataType => Str

The data type for the vectors when using a model to convert text into
vector embeddings. The model must support the specified data type for
vector embeddings. Floating-point (float32) is the default data type,
and is supported by most models for vector embeddings. See Supported
embeddings models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base-supported.html)
for information on the available models and their vector data types.
