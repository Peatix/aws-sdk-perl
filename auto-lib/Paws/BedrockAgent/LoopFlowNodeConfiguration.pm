=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Definition => $value, ..., Definition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::LoopFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Definition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for the nodes of a DoWhile loop in your flow.

A DoWhile loop is made up of the following nodes:

=over

=item *

C<Loop> - The container node that holds the loop's flow definition.
This node encompasses the entire loop structure.

=item *

C<LoopInput> - The entry point node for the loop. This node receives
inputs from nodes outside the loop and from previous loop iterations.

=item *

Body nodes - These can be

=item *

C<LoopController> - The node that evaluates whether the loop should
continue or exit based on a condition.

=back

These nodes work together to create a loop that runs at least once and
continues until a specified condition is met or a maximum number of
iterations is reached.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Definition => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::FlowDefinition>

The definition of the DoWhile loop nodes and connections between nodes
in the flow.
