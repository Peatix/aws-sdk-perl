=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::InlineCodeFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::InlineCodeFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., Language => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::InlineCodeFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for an inline code node in your flow. Inline
code nodes let you write and execute code directly within your flow,
enabling data transformations, custom logic, and integrations without
needing an external Lambda function.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Code => Str

The code that's executed in your inline code node. The code can access
input data from previous nodes in the flow, perform operations on that
data, and produce output that can be used by other nodes in your flow.

The code must be valid in the programming C<language> that you specify.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Language => Str

The programming language used by your inline code node.

The code must be valid in the programming C<language> that you specify.
Currently, only Python 3 (C<Python_3>) is supported.
