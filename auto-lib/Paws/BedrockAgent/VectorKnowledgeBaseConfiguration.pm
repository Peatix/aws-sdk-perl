=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorKnowledgeBaseConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorKnowledgeBaseConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EmbeddingModelArn => $value, ..., SupplementalDataStorageConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorKnowledgeBaseConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EmbeddingModelArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains details about the model used to create vector embeddings for
the knowledge base.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EmbeddingModelArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the model used to create vector
embeddings for the knowledge base.


=head2 EmbeddingModelConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::EmbeddingModelConfiguration>

The embeddings model configuration details for the vector model used in
Knowledge Base.


=head2 SupplementalDataStorageConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::SupplementalDataStorageConfiguration>

If you include multimodal data from your data source, use this object
to specify configurations for the storage location of the images
extracted from your documents. These images can be retrieved and
returned to the end user. They can also be used in generation when
using RetrieveAndGenerate
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_agent-runtime_RetrieveAndGenerate.html).



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::BedrockAgent>
