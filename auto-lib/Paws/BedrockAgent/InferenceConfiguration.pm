=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::InferenceConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::InferenceConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumLength => $value, ..., TopP => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::InferenceConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumLength

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains inference parameters to use when the agent invokes a
foundation model in the part of the agent sequence defined by the
C<promptType>. For more information, see Inference parameters for
foundation models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaximumLength => Int

The maximum number of tokens to allow in the generated response.


=head2 StopSequences => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of stop sequences. A stop sequence is a sequence of characters
that causes the model to stop generating the response.


=head2 Temperature => Num

The likelihood of the model selecting higher-probability options while
generating a response. A lower value makes the model more likely to
choose higher-probability options, while a higher value makes the model
more likely to choose lower-probability options.


=head2 TopK => Int

While generating a response, the model determines the probability of
the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set
for C<topK> is the number of most-likely candidates from which the
model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you set
C<topK> to 50, the model selects the next token from among the top 50
most likely choices.


=head2 TopP => Num

While generating a response, the model determines the probability of
the following token at each point of generation. The value that you set
for C<Top P> determines the number of most-likely candidates from which
the model chooses the next token in the sequence. For example, if you
set C<topP> to 0.8, the model only selects the next token from the top
80% of the probability distribution of next tokens.
