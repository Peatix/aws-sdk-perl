=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::KnowledgeBaseFlowNodeConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::KnowledgeBaseFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GuardrailConfiguration => $value, ..., RerankingConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::KnowledgeBaseFlowNodeConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GuardrailConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configurations for a knowledge base node in a flow. This node
takes a query as the input and returns, as the output, the retrieved
responses directly (as an array) or a response generated based on the
retrieved responses. For more information, see Node types in a flow
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/flows-nodes.html)
in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GuardrailConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::GuardrailConfiguration>

Contains configurations for a guardrail to apply during query and
response generation for the knowledge base in this configuration.


=head2 InferenceConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::PromptInferenceConfiguration>

Contains inference configurations for the prompt.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KnowledgeBaseId => Str

The unique identifier of the knowledge base to query.


=head2 ModelId => Str

The unique identifier of the model or inference profile
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html)
to use to generate a response from the query results. Omit this field
if you want to return the retrieved results as an array.


=head2 NumberOfResults => Int

The number of results to retrieve from the knowledge base.


=head2 OrchestrationConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::KnowledgeBaseOrchestrationConfiguration>

The configuration for orchestrating the retrieval and generation
process in the knowledge base node.


=head2 PromptTemplate => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::KnowledgeBasePromptTemplate>

A custom prompt template to use with the knowledge base for generating
responses.


=head2 RerankingConfiguration => L<Paws::BedrockAgent::VectorSearchRerankingConfiguration>

The configuration for reranking the retrieved results from the
knowledge base to improve relevance.
