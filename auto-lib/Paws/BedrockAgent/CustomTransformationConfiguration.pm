=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::CustomTransformationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::CustomTransformationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IntermediateStorage => $value, ..., Transformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::CustomTransformationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IntermediateStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for customizing steps in the data source content ingestion
pipeline.

You can configure the data source to process documents with a Lambda
function after they are parsed and converted into chunks. When you add
a post-chunking transformation, the service stores chunked documents in
an S3 bucket and invokes a Lambda function to process them.

To process chunked documents with a Lambda function, define an S3
bucket path for input and output objects, and a transformation that
specifies the Lambda function to invoke. You can use the Lambda
function to customize how chunks are split, and the metadata for each
chunk.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

An S3 bucket path for input and output objects.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Transformations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BedrockAgent::Transformation>]

A Lambda function that processes documents.
