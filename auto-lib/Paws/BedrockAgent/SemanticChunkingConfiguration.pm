=head1 NAME

Paws::BedrockAgent::SemanticChunkingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BedrockAgent::SemanticChunkingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BreakpointPercentileThreshold => $value, ..., MaxTokens => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BedrockAgent::SemanticChunkingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BreakpointPercentileThreshold

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings for semantic document chunking for a data source. Semantic
chunking splits a document into into smaller documents based on groups
of similar content derived from the text with natural language
processing.

With semantic chunking, each sentence is compared to the next to
determine how similar they are. You specify a threshold in the form of
a percentile, where adjacent sentences that are less similar than that
percentage of sentence pairs are divided into separate chunks. For
example, if you set the threshold to 90, then the 10 percent of
sentence pairs that are least similar are split. So if you have 101
sentences, 100 sentence pairs are compared, and the 10 with the least
similarity are split, creating 11 chunks. These chunks are further
split if they exceed the max token size.

You must also specify a buffer size, which determines whether sentences
are compared in isolation, or within a moving context window that
includes the previous and following sentence. For example, if you set
the buffer size to C<1>, the embedding for sentence 10 is derived from
sentences 9, 10, and 11 combined.
