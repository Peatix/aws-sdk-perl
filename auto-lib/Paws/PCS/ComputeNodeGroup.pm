=head1 NAME

Paws::PCS::ComputeNodeGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PCS::ComputeNodeGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AmiId => $value, ..., SubnetIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PCS::ComputeNodeGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AmiId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A compute node group associated with a cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AmiId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that Amazon Web Services PCS
uses to launch instances. If not provided, Amazon Web Services PCS uses
the AMI ID specified in the custom launch template.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute node group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClusterId => Str

The ID of the cluster of the compute node group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The date and time the resource was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CustomLaunchTemplate => L<Paws::PCS::CustomLaunchTemplate>




=head2 ErrorInfo => ArrayRef[L<Paws::PCS::ErrorInfo>]

The list of errors that occurred during compute node group
provisioning.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IamInstanceProfileArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM instance profile used to pass
an IAM role when launching EC2 instances. The role contained in your
instance profile must have the C<pcs:RegisterComputeNodeGroupInstance>
permission. The resource identifier of the ARN must start with
C<AWSPCS> or it must have C</aws-pcs/> in its path.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The generated unique ID of the compute node group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceConfigs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::PCS::InstanceConfig>]

A list of EC2 instance configurations that Amazon Web Services PCS can
provision in the compute node group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModifiedAt => Str

The date and time the resource was modified.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name that identifies the compute node group.


=head2 PurchaseOption => Str

Specifies how EC2 instances are purchased on your behalf. Amazon Web
Services PCS supports On-Demand and Spot instances. For more
information, see Instance purchasing options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>. If you don't provide
this option, it defaults to On-Demand.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScalingConfiguration => L<Paws::PCS::ScalingConfiguration>




=head2 SlurmConfiguration => L<Paws::PCS::ComputeNodeGroupSlurmConfiguration>




=head2 SpotOptions => L<Paws::PCS::SpotOptions>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The provisioning status of the compute node group.

The provisioning status doesn't indicate the overall health of the
compute node group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of subnet IDs where instances are provisioned by the compute
node group. The subnets must be in the same VPC as the cluster.
