=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::StreamSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::StreamSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChannelArn => $value, ..., ViewerCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::StreamSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChannelArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary information about a stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ChannelArn => Str

Channel ARN for the stream.


=head2 Health => Str

The streamE<rsquo>s health.


=head2 StartTime => Str

Time of the streamE<rsquo>s start. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
I<note that this is returned as a string>.


=head2 State => Str

The streamE<rsquo>s state. Do not rely on the C<OFFLINE> state, as the
API may not return it; instead, a "NotBroadcasting" error will indicate
that the stream is not live.


=head2 StreamId => Str

Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the specified
channel.


=head2 ViewerCount => Int

A count of concurrent views of the stream. Typically, a new view
appears in C<viewerCount> within 15 seconds of when video playback
starts and a view is removed from C<viewerCount> within 1 minute of
when video playback ends. A value of -1 indicates that the request
timed out; in this case, retry.
