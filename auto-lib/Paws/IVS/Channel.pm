=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::Channel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::Channel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::Channel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying a channel.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

Channel ARN.


=head2 Authorized => Bool

Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).
Default: C<false>.


=head2 ContainerFormat => Str

Indicates which content-packaging format is used (MPEG-TS or fMP4). If
C<multitrackInputConfiguration> is specified and C<enabled> is C<true>,
then C<containerFormat> is required and must be set to
C<FRAGMENTED_MP4>. Otherwise, C<containerFormat> may be set to C<TS> or
C<FRAGMENTED_MP4>. Default: C<TS>.


=head2 IngestEndpoint => Str

Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an ingest server,
used when you set up streaming software.


=head2 InsecureIngest => Bool

Whether the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default: C<false>.


=head2 LatencyMode => Str

Channel latency mode. Use C<NORMAL> to broadcast and deliver live video
up to Full HD. Use C<LOW> for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
Default: C<LOW>.


=head2 MultitrackInputConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::MultitrackInputConfiguration>

Object specifying multitrack input configuration. Default: no
multitrack input configuration is specified.


=head2 Name => Str

Channel name.


=head2 PlaybackRestrictionPolicyArn => Str

Playback-restriction-policy ARN. A valid ARN value here both specifies
the ARN and enables playback restriction. Default: "" (empty string, no
playback restriction policy is applied).


=head2 PlaybackUrl => Str

Channel playback URL.


=head2 Preset => Str

Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable only for
C<ADVANCED_HD> and C<ADVANCED_SD> channel types. For those channel
types, the default C<preset> is C<HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY>. For other
channel types (C<BASIC> and C<STANDARD>), C<preset> is the empty string
(C<"">).


=head2 RecordingConfigurationArn => Str

Recording-configuration ARN. A valid ARN value here both specifies the
ARN and enables recording. Default: "" (empty string, recording is
disabled).


=head2 Srt => L<Paws::IVS::Srt>

Specifies the endpoint and optional passphrase for streaming with the
SRT protocol.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::IVS::Tags>

Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form
C<string:string (key:value)>. See Best practices and strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html)
in I<Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor> for details,
including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
what is documented there.


=head2 Type => Str

Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.
I<If you exceed the allowable input resolution or bitrate, the stream
probably will disconnect immediately.> Default: C<STANDARD>. For
details, see Channel Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/LowLatencyAPIReference/channel-types.html).
