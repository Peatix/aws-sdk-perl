=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::AudioConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::AudioConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Channels => $value, ..., Track => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::AudioConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Channels

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying a streamE<rsquo>s audio configuration, as set up by
the broadcaster (usually in an encoder). This is part of the
IngestConfigurations object and the deprecated IngestConfiguration
object. It is used for monitoring stream health.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Channels => Int

Number of audio channels.


=head2 Codec => Str

Codec used for the audio encoding.


=head2 SampleRate => Int

Number of audio samples recorded per second.


=head2 TargetBitrate => Int

The expected ingest bitrate (bits per second). This is configured in
the encoder.


=head2 Track => Str

Name of the audio track (if the stream has an audio track). If
multitrack is not enabled, this is track0 (the sole track).
