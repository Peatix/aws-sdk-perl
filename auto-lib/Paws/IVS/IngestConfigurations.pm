=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::IngestConfigurations

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::IngestConfigurations object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AudioConfigurations => $value, ..., VideoConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::IngestConfigurations object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AudioConfigurations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying the ingest configuration set up by the broadcaster,
usually in an encoder.

B<Note:> Use IngestConfigurations instead of IngestConfiguration (which
is deprecated). If multitrack is not enabled, IngestConfiguration and
IngestConfigurations contain the same data, namely information about
track0 (the sole track). If multitrack is enabled, IngestConfiguration
contains data for only the first track (track0) and
IngestConfigurations contains data for all tracks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AudioConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IVS::AudioConfiguration>]

Encoder settings for audio.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VideoConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IVS::VideoConfiguration>]

Encoder settings for video
