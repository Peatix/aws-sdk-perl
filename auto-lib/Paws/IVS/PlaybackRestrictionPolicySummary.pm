=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::PlaybackRestrictionPolicySummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::PlaybackRestrictionPolicySummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedCountries => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::PlaybackRestrictionPolicySummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedCountries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Summary information about a PlaybackRestrictionPolicy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowedCountries => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of country codes that control geoblocking restriction. Allowed

countries (an empty array).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AllowedOrigins => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of origin sites that control CORS restriction. Allowed values
are the same as valid values of the Origin header defined at
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin).
Default: All origins (an empty array).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Playback-restriction-policy ARN


=head2 EnableStrictOriginEnforcement => Bool

Whether channel playback is constrained by origin site. Default:
C<false>.


=head2 Name => Str

Playback-restriction-policy name. The value does not need to be unique.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::IVS::Tags>

Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form
C<string:string (key:value)>. See Best practices and strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html)
in I<Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor> for details,
including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
what is documented there.
