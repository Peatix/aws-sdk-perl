=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::MultitrackInputConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::MultitrackInputConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., Policy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::MultitrackInputConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that specifies multitrack input configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Enabled => Bool

Indicates whether multitrack input is enabled. Can be set to C<true>
only if channel type is C<STANDARD>. Setting C<enabled> to C<true> with
any other channel type will cause an exception. If C<true>, then
C<policy>, C<maximumResolution>, and C<containerFormat> are required,
and C<containerFormat> must be set to C<FRAGMENTED_MP4>. Default:
C<false>.


=head2 MaximumResolution => Str

Maximum resolution for multitrack input. Required if C<enabled> is
C<true>.


=head2 Policy => Str

Indicates whether multitrack input is allowed or required. Required if
C<enabled> is C<true>.
