=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::ThumbnailConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::ThumbnailConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RecordingMode => $value, ..., TargetIntervalSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::ThumbnailConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RecordingMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a configuration of thumbnails for recorded
video.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RecordingMode => Str

Thumbnail recording mode. Default: C<INTERVAL>.


=head2 Resolution => Str

Indicates the desired resolution of recorded thumbnails. Thumbnails are
recorded at the selected resolution if the corresponding rendition is
available during the stream; otherwise, they are recorded at source
resolution. For more information about resolution values and their
corresponding height and width dimensions, see Auto-Record to Amazon S3
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/record-to-s3.html).
Default: Null (source resolution is returned).


=head2 Storage => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates the format in which thumbnails are recorded. C<SEQUENTIAL>
records all generated thumbnails in a serial manner, to the
media/thumbnails directory. C<LATEST> saves the latest thumbnail in
media/latest_thumbnail/thumb.jpg and overwrites it at the interval
specified by C<targetIntervalSeconds>. You can enable both
C<SEQUENTIAL> and C<LATEST>. Default: C<SEQUENTIAL>.


=head2 TargetIntervalSeconds => Int

The targeted thumbnail-generation interval in seconds. This is
configurable (and required) only if C<recordingMode> is C<INTERVAL>.
Default: 60.

B<Important:> For the C<BASIC> channel type, or the C<STANDARD> channel
type with multitrack input, setting a value for
C<targetIntervalSeconds> does not guarantee that thumbnails are
generated at the specified interval. For thumbnails to be generated at
the C<targetIntervalSeconds> interval, the C<IDR/Keyframe> value for
the input video must be less than the C<targetIntervalSeconds> value.
See Amazon IVS Streaming Configuration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/streaming-config.html)
for information on setting C<IDR/Keyframe> to the recommended value in
video-encoder settings.
