=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::StreamSession

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::StreamSession object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Channel => $value, ..., TruncatedEvents => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::StreamSession object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Channel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object that captures the Amazon IVS configuration that the customer
provisioned, the ingest configurations that the broadcaster used, and
the most recent Amazon IVS stream events it encountered.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Channel => L<Paws::IVS::Channel>

The properties of the channel at the time of going live.


=head2 EndTime => Str

Time when the channel went offline. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp;
I<note that this is returned as a string>. For live streams, this is
C<NULL>.


=head2 IngestConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::IngestConfiguration>

The properties of the incoming RTMP stream.

B<Note:> C<ingestConfiguration> is deprecated in favor of
C<ingestConfigurations> but retained to ensure backward compatibility.
If multitrack is not enabled, C<ingestConfiguration> and
C<ingestConfigurations> contain the same data, namely information about
track0 (the sole track). If multitrack is enabled,
C<ingestConfiguration> contains data for only the first track (track0)
and C<ingestConfigurations> contains data for all tracks.


=head2 IngestConfigurations => L<Paws::IVS::IngestConfigurations>

The properties of the incoming RTMP stream. If multitrack is enabled,
C<ingestConfigurations> contains data for all tracks; otherwise, it
contains data only for track0 (the sole track).


=head2 RecordingConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::RecordingConfiguration>

The properties of recording the live stream.


=head2 StartTime => Str

Time when the channel went live. This is an ISO 8601 timestamp; I<note
that this is returned as a string>.


=head2 StreamId => Str

Unique identifier for a live or previously live stream in the specified
channel.


=head2 TruncatedEvents => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IVS::StreamEvent>]

List of Amazon IVS events that the stream encountered. The list is
sorted by most recent events and contains up to 500 events. For Amazon
IVS events, see Using Amazon EventBridge with Amazon IVS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/eventbridge.html).
