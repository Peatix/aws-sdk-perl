=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::VideoConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::VideoConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvcLevel => $value, ..., VideoWidth => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::VideoConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvcLevel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object specifying a streamE<rsquo>s video configuration, as set up by
the broadcaster (usually in an encoder). This is part of the
IngestConfigurations object and the deprecated IngestConfiguration
object. It is used for monitoring stream health.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvcLevel => Str

Indicates the degree of required decoder performance for a profile.
Normally this is set automatically by the encoder. For details, see the
H.264 specification.


=head2 AvcProfile => Str

Indicates to the decoder the requirements for decoding the stream. For
definitions of the valid values, see the H.264 specification.


=head2 Codec => Str

Codec used for the video encoding.


=head2 Encoder => Str

Software or hardware used to encode the video.


=head2 Level => Str

Indicates the degree of required decoder performance for a profile.
Normally this is set automatically by the encoder. When an AVC codec is
used, this field has the same value as C<avcLevel>.


=head2 Profile => Str

Indicates to the decoder the requirements for decoding the stream. When
an AVC codec is used, this field has the same value as C<avcProfile>.


=head2 TargetBitrate => Int

The expected ingest bitrate (bits per second). This is configured in
the encoder.


=head2 TargetFramerate => Int

The expected ingest framerate. This is configured in the encoder.


=head2 Track => Str

Name of the video track. If multitrack is not enabled, this is track0
(the sole track).


=head2 VideoHeight => Int

Video-resolution height in pixels.


=head2 VideoWidth => Int

Video-resolution width in pixels.
