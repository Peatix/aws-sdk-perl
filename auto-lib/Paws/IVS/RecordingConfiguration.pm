=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::RecordingConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::RecordingConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., ThumbnailConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::RecordingConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a configuration to record a channel stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

Recording-configuration ARN.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DestinationConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::DestinationConfiguration>

A complex type that contains information about where recorded video
will be stored.


=head2 Name => Str

Recording-configuration name. The value does not need to be unique.


=head2 RecordingReconnectWindowSeconds => Int

If a broadcast disconnects and then reconnects within the specified
interval, the multiple streams will be considered a single broadcast
and merged together. Default: 0.


=head2 RenditionConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::RenditionConfiguration>

Object that describes which renditions should be recorded for a stream.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> State => Str

Indicates the current state of the recording configuration. When the
state is C<ACTIVE>, the configuration is ready for recording a channel
stream.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::IVS::Tags>

Tags attached to the resource. Array of 1-50 maps, each of the form
C<string:string (key:value)>. See Best practices and strategies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/tag-editor/latest/userguide/best-practices-and-strats.html)
in I<Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources and Tag Editor> for details,
including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and
requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond
what is documented there.


=head2 ThumbnailConfiguration => L<Paws::IVS::ThumbnailConfiguration>

A complex type that allows you to enable/disable the recording of
thumbnails for a live session and modify the interval at which
thumbnails are generated for the live session.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::IVS>
