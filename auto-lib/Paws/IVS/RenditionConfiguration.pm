=head1 NAME

Paws::IVS::RenditionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IVS::RenditionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Renditions => $value, ..., RenditionSelection => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IVS::RenditionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Renditions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object that describes which renditions should be recorded for a stream.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Renditions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates which renditions are recorded for a stream, if
C<renditionSelection> is C<CUSTOM>; otherwise, this field is
irrelevant. The selected renditions are recorded if they are available
during the stream. If a selected rendition is unavailable, the best
available rendition is recorded. For details on the resolution
dimensions of each rendition, see Auto-Record to Amazon S3
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/record-to-s3.html).


=head2 RenditionSelection => Str

Indicates which set of renditions are recorded for a stream. For
C<BASIC> channels, the C<CUSTOM> value has no effect. If C<CUSTOM> is
specified, a set of renditions must be specified in the C<renditions>
field. Default: C<ALL>.
