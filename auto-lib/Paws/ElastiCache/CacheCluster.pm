=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::CacheCluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::CacheCluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., TransitEncryptionMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::CacheCluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains all of the attributes of a specific cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the cache cluster.


=head2 AtRestEncryptionEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables encryption at-rest when set to C<true>.

You cannot modify the value of C<AtRestEncryptionEnabled> after the
cluster is created. To enable at-rest encryption on a cluster you must
set C<AtRestEncryptionEnabled> to C<true> when you create a cluster.

B<Required:> Only available when creating a replication group in an
Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version C<3.2.6>, C<4.x> or later.

Default: C<false>


=head2 AuthTokenEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables using an C<AuthToken> (password) when issuing
Valkey or Redis OSS commands.

Default: C<false>


=head2 AuthTokenLastModifiedDate => Str

The date the auth token was last modified


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

If you are running Valkey or Redis OSS engine version 6.0 or later, set
this parameter to yes if you want to opt-in to the next auto minor
version upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for previous
versions.


=head2 CacheClusterCreateTime => Str

The date and time when the cluster was created.


=head2 CacheClusterId => Str

The user-supplied identifier of the cluster. This identifier is a
unique key that identifies a cluster.


=head2 CacheClusterStatus => Str

The current state of this cluster, one of the following values:
C<available>, C<creating>, C<deleted>, C<deleting>,
C<incompatible-network>, C<modifying>, C<rebooting cluster nodes>,
C<restore-failed>, or C<snapshotting>.


=head2 CacheNodes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElastiCache::CacheNode>]

A list of cache nodes that are members of the cluster.


=head2 CacheNodeType => Str

The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for the cluster.

The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and
computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent
previous generation counterparts.
