=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroupPendingModifiedValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroupPendingModifiedValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthTokenStatus => $value, ..., UserGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroupPendingModifiedValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthTokenStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings to be applied to the Valkey or Redis OSS replication
group, either immediately or during the next maintenance window.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthTokenStatus => Str

The auth token status


=head2 AutomaticFailoverStatus => Str

Indicates the status of automatic failover for this Valkey or Redis OSS
replication group.


=head2 ClusterMode => Str

Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode from Disabled to Enabled,
you must first set the cluster mode to Compatible. Compatible mode
allows your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to connect using both cluster
mode enabled and cluster mode disabled. After you migrate all Valkey or
Redis OSS clients to use cluster mode enabled, you can then complete
cluster mode configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.


=head2 LogDeliveryConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElastiCache::PendingLogDeliveryConfiguration>]

The log delivery configurations being modified


=head2 PrimaryClusterId => Str

The primary cluster ID that is applied immediately (if
C<--apply-immediately> was specified), or during the next maintenance
window.


=head2 Resharding => L<Paws::ElastiCache::ReshardingStatus>

The status of an online resharding operation.


=head2 TransitEncryptionEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.


=head2 TransitEncryptionMode => Str

A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit
encryption, with no downtime.


=head2 UserGroups => L<Paws::ElastiCache::UserGroupsUpdateStatus>

The user group being modified.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ElastiCache>
