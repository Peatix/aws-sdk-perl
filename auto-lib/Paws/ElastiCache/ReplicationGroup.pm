=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., UserGroupIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains all of the attributes of a specific Valkey or Redis OSS
replication group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the replication group.


=head2 AtRestEncryptionEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables encryption at-rest when set to C<true>.

You cannot modify the value of C<AtRestEncryptionEnabled> after the
cluster is created. To enable encryption at-rest on a cluster you must
set C<AtRestEncryptionEnabled> to C<true> when you create a cluster.

B<Required:> Only available when creating a replication group in an
Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version C<3.2.6>, C<4.x> or later.

Default: C<false>


=head2 AuthTokenEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables using an C<AuthToken> (password) when issuing
Valkey or Redis OSS commands.

Default: C<false>


=head2 AuthTokenLastModifiedDate => Str

The date the auth token was last modified


=head2 AutomaticFailover => Str

Indicates the status of automatic failover for this Valkey or Redis OSS
replication group.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

If you are running Valkey 7.2 and above, or Redis OSS engine version
6.0 and above, set this parameter to yes if you want to opt-in to the
next auto minor version upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled
for previous versions.


=head2 CacheNodeType => Str

The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for each node in
the replication group.


=head2 ClusterEnabled => Bool

A flag indicating whether or not this replication group is cluster
enabled; i.e., whether its data can be partitioned across multiple
shards (API/CLI: node groups).

Valid values: C<true> | C<false>


=head2 ClusterMode => Str

Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode from Disabled to Enabled,
you must first set the cluster mode to Compatible. Compatible mode
allows your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to connect using both cluster
mode enabled and cluster mode disabled. After you migrate all Valkey or
Redis OSS clients to use cluster mode enabled, you can then complete
cluster mode configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.


=head2 ConfigurationEndpoint => L<Paws::ElastiCache::Endpoint>

The configuration endpoint for this replication group. Use the
configuration endpoint to connect to this replication group.


=head2 DataTiering => Str

Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for replication
groups using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set to true
when using r6gd nodes. For more information, see Data tiering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/data-tiering.html).


=head2 Description => Str

The user supplied description of the replication group.


=head2 Engine => Str

The engine used in a replication group. The options are redis,
memcached or valkey.


=head2 GlobalReplicationGroupInfo => L<Paws::ElastiCache::GlobalReplicationGroupInfo>

The name of the Global datastore and role of this replication group in
the Global datastore.


=head2 IpDiscovery => Str

The network type you choose when modifying a cluster, either C<ipv4> |
C<ipv6>. IPv6 is supported for workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above,
Redis OSS engine version 6.2 to 7.1 or Memcached engine version 1.6.6
and above on all instances built on the Nitro system
(http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/).


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the disk in the cluster.


=head2 LogDeliveryConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElastiCache::LogDeliveryConfiguration>]

Returns the destination, format and type of the logs.


=head2 MemberClusters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names of all the cache clusters that are part of this replication
group.


=head2 MemberClustersOutpostArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The outpost ARNs of the replication group's member clusters.


=head2 MultiAZ => Str

A flag indicating if you have Multi-AZ enabled to enhance fault
tolerance. For more information, see Minimizing Downtime: Multi-AZ
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/AutoFailover.html)


=head2 NetworkType => Str

Must be either C<ipv4> | C<ipv6> | C<dual_stack>. IPv6 is supported for
workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above, Redis OSS engine version 6.2 to
7.1 or Memcached engine version 1.6.6 and above on all instances built
on the Nitro system (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/).


=head2 NodeGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElastiCache::NodeGroup>]

A list of node groups in this replication group. For Valkey or Redis
OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication groups, this is a
single-element list. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled)
replication groups, the list contains an entry for each node group
(shard).


=head2 PendingModifiedValues => L<Paws::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroupPendingModifiedValues>

A group of settings to be applied to the replication group, either
immediately or during the next maintenance window.


=head2 ReplicationGroupCreateTime => Str

The date and time when the cluster was created.


=head2 ReplicationGroupId => Str

The identifier for the replication group.


=head2 SnapshotRetentionLimit => Int

The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic cluster
snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set
C<SnapshotRetentionLimit> to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is
retained for 5 days before being deleted.

If the value of C<SnapshotRetentionLimit> is set to zero (0), backups
are turned off.


=head2 SnapshottingClusterId => Str

The cluster ID that is used as the daily snapshot source for the
replication group.


=head2 SnapshotWindow => Str

The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a
daily snapshot of your node group (shard).

Example: C<05:00-09:00>

If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses
an appropriate time range.

This parameter is only valid if the C<Engine> parameter is C<redis>.


=head2 Status => Str

The current state of this replication group - C<creating>,
C<available>, C<modifying>, C<deleting>, C<create-failed>,
C<snapshotting>.


=head2 TransitEncryptionEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to C<true>.

B<Required:> Only available when creating a replication group in an
Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version C<3.2.6>, C<4.x> or later.

Default: C<false>


=head2 TransitEncryptionMode => Str

A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit
encryption, with no downtime.


=head2 UserGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The ID of the user group associated to the replication group.
