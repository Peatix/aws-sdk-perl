=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::Subnet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::Subnet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SubnetAvailabilityZone => $value, ..., SupportedNetworkTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::Subnet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SubnetAvailabilityZone

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the subnet associated with a cluster. This parameter refers
to subnets defined in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and
used with ElastiCache.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 SubnetAvailabilityZone => L<Paws::ElastiCache::AvailabilityZone>

The Availability Zone associated with the subnet.


=head2 SubnetIdentifier => Str

The unique identifier for the subnet.


=head2 SubnetOutpost => L<Paws::ElastiCache::SubnetOutpost>

The outpost ARN of the subnet.


=head2 SupportedNetworkTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Either C<ipv4> | C<ipv6> | C<dual_stack>. IPv6 is supported for
workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above, Redis OSS engine version 6.2 to
7.1 or Memcached engine version 1.6.6 and above on all instances built
on the Nitro system (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/).
