=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::Snapshot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::Snapshot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::Snapshot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a copy of an entire Valkey or Redis OSS cluster as of the
time when the snapshot was taken.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the snapshot.


=head2 AutomaticFailover => Str

Indicates the status of automatic failover for the source Valkey or
Redis OSS replication group.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

If you are running Valkey 7.2 and above or Redis OSS engine version 6.0
and above, set this parameter to yes if you want to opt-in to the next
auto minor version upgrade campaign. This parameter is disabled for
previous versions.


=head2 CacheClusterCreateTime => Str

The date and time when the source cluster was created.


=head2 CacheClusterId => Str

The user-supplied identifier of the source cluster.


=head2 CacheNodeType => Str

The name of the compute and memory capacity node type for the source
cluster.

The following node types are supported by ElastiCache. Generally
speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and
computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent
previous generation counterparts.

=head2 CacheSubnetGroupName => Str

The name of the cache subnet group associated with the source cluster.


=head2 DataTiering => Str

Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for replication
groups using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set to true
when using r6gd nodes. For more information, see Data tiering
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/data-tiering.html).


=head2 Engine => Str

The name of the cache engine (C<memcached> or C<redis>) used by the

cluster.

A list of the cache nodes in the source cluster.


=head2 NumCacheNodes => Int

The number of cache nodes in the source cluster.

For clusters running Valkey or Redis OSS, this value must be 1. For
clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.


=head2 NumNodeGroups => Int

The number of node groups (shards) in this snapshot. When restoring
from a snapshot, the number of node groups (shards) in the snapshot and

is performed. It is specified as a range in the format
ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window
is a 60 minute period.

Valid values for C<ddd> are:

=head2 ReplicationGroupDescription => Str

A description of the source replication group.


=head2 ReplicationGroupId => Str

The unique identifier of the source replication group.


=head2 SnapshotName => Str

system-generated. For a manual snapshot, this is the user-provided
name.


=head2 SnapshotRetentionLimit => Int

For an automatic snapshot, the number of days for which ElastiCache
retains the snapshot before deleting it.

For manual snapshots, this field reflects the C<SnapshotRetentionLimit>
for the source cluster when the snapshot was created. This field is
otherwise ignored: Manual snapshots do not expire, and can only be
deleted using the C<DeleteSnapshot> operation.

B<Important> If the value of SnapshotRetentionLimit is set to zero (0),
backups are turned off.


=head2 SnapshotSource => Str

Indicates whether the snapshot is from an automatic backup
(C<automated>) or was created manually (C<manual>).


=head2 SnapshotStatus => Str

The status of the snapshot. Valid values: C<creating> | C<available> |
C<restoring> | C<copying> | C<deleting>.


=head2 SnapshotWindow => Str

the source cluster.


=head2 TopicArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the topic used by the source cluster
for publishing notifications.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The Amazon Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID) of the cache
subnet group for the source cluster.
