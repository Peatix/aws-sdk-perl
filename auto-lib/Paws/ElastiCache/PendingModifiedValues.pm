=head1 NAME

Paws::ElastiCache::PendingModifiedValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ElastiCache::PendingModifiedValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthTokenStatus => $value, ..., TransitEncryptionMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ElastiCache::PendingModifiedValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthTokenStatus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A group of settings that are applied to the cluster in the future, or
that are currently being applied.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthTokenStatus => Str

The auth token status


=head2 CacheNodeIdsToRemove => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of cache node IDs that are being removed (or will be removed)
from the cluster. A node ID is a 4-digit numeric identifier (0001,
0002, etc.).


=head2 CacheNodeType => Str

The cache node type that this cluster or replication group is scaled
to.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The new cache engine version that the cluster runs.


=head2 LogDeliveryConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ElastiCache::PendingLogDeliveryConfiguration>]

The log delivery configurations being modified


=head2 NumCacheNodes => Int

The new number of cache nodes for the cluster.

For clusters running Valkey or Redis OSS, this value must be 1. For
clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.


=head2 ScaleConfig => L<Paws::ElastiCache::ScaleConfig>

The scaling configuration changes that are pending for the Memcached
cluster.


=head2 TransitEncryptionEnabled => Bool

A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true.


=head2 TransitEncryptionMode => Str

A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit
encryption, with no downtime.



=head1 SEE ALSO
