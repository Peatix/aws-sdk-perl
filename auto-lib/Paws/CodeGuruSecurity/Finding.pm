=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Finding

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Finding object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., Vulnerability => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Finding object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a finding that was detected in your code.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time when the finding was created.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the finding.


=head2 DetectorId => Str

The identifier for the detector that detected the finding in your code.
A detector is a defined rule based on industry standards and AWS best
practices.


=head2 DetectorName => Str

The name of the detector that identified the security vulnerability in
your code.


=head2 DetectorTags => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more tags or categorizations that are associated with a
detector. These tags are defined by type, programming language, or
other classification such as maintainability or consistency.


=head2 GeneratorId => Str

The identifier for the component that generated a finding such as
AmazonCodeGuruSecurity.


=head2 Id => Str

The identifier for a finding.


=head2 Remediation => L<Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Remediation>

An object that contains the details about how to remediate a finding.


=head2 Resource => L<Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Resource>

The resource where Amazon CodeGuru Security detected a finding.


=head2 RuleId => Str

The identifier for the rule that generated the finding.


=head2 Severity => Str

The severity of the finding. Severity can be critical, high, medium,
low, or informational. For information on severity levels, see Finding
severity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/security-ug/findings-overview.html#severity-distribution)
in the I<Amazon CodeGuru Security User Guide>.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the finding. A finding status can be open or closed.


=head2 Title => Str

The title of the finding.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of finding.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The time when the finding was last updated. Findings are updated when
you remediate them or when the finding code location changes.


=head2 Vulnerability => L<Paws::CodeGuruSecurity::Vulnerability>

An object that describes the detected security vulnerability.
