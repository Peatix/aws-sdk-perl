=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::InstanceInformation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::InstanceInformation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivationId => $value, ..., SourceType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::InstanceInformation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActivationId => Str

The activation ID created by Amazon Web Services Systems Manager when
the server or virtual machine (VM) was registered.


=head2 AgentVersion => Str

The version of SSM Agent running on your Linux managed node.


=head2 AssociationOverview => L<Paws::SSM::InstanceAggregatedAssociationOverview>

Information about the association.


=head2 AssociationStatus => Str

The status of the association.


=head2 ComputerName => Str

The fully qualified host name of the managed node.


=head2 IamRole => Str

The role assigned to an Amazon EC2 instance configured with a Systems
Manager Quick Setup host management configuration or the role assigned
to an on-premises managed node.

This call doesn't return the IAM role for I<unmanaged> Amazon EC2
instances (instances not configured for Systems Manager). To retrieve
the role for an unmanaged instance, use the Amazon EC2
C<DescribeInstances> operation. For information, see DescribeInstances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 API Reference> or describe-instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services CLI Command Reference>.


=head2 InstanceId => Str

The managed node ID.


=head2 IPAddress => Str

The IP address of the managed node.


=head2 IsLatestVersion => Bool

Indicates whether the latest version of SSM Agent is running on your
Linux managed node. This field doesn't indicate whether or not the
latest version is installed on Windows managed nodes, because some
older versions of Windows Server use the EC2Config service to process
Systems Manager requests.


=head2 LastAssociationExecutionDate => Str

The date the association was last run.


=head2 LastPingDateTime => Str

The date and time when the agent last pinged the Systems Manager
service.


=head2 LastSuccessfulAssociationExecutionDate => Str

The last date the association was successfully run.


=head2 Name => Str

The name assigned to an on-premises server, edge device, or virtual
machine (VM) when it is activated as a Systems Manager managed node.
The name is specified as the C<DefaultInstanceName> property using the
CreateActivation command. It is applied to the managed node by
specifying the Activation Code and Activation ID when you install SSM
Agent on the node, as explained in How to install SSM Agent on hybrid
Linux nodes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/hybrid-multicloud-ssm-agent-install-linux.html)
and How to install SSM Agent on hybrid Windows Server nodes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/hybrid-multicloud-ssm-agent-install-windows.html).
To retrieve the C<Name> tag of an EC2 instance, use the Amazon EC2
C<DescribeInstances> operation. For information, see DescribeInstances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInstances.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 API Reference> or describe-instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services CLI Command Reference>.


=head2 PingStatus => Str

Connection status of SSM Agent.

The status C<Inactive> has been deprecated and is no longer in use.


=head2 PlatformName => Str

The name of the operating system platform running on your managed node.


=head2 PlatformType => Str

The operating system platform type.


=head2 PlatformVersion => Str

The version of the OS platform running on your managed node.


=head2 RegistrationDate => Str

The date the server or VM was registered with Amazon Web Services as a
managed node.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of instance. Instances are either EC2 instances or managed
instances.


=head2 SourceId => Str

The ID of the source resource. For IoT Greengrass devices, C<SourceId>
is the Thing name.


=head2 SourceType => Str

The type of the source resource. For IoT Greengrass devices,
C<SourceType> is C<AWS::IoT::Thing>.
