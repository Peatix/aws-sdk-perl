=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::Association

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::Association object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociationId => $value, ..., Targets => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::Association object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an association of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
document (SSM document) and a managed node.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociationId => Str

The ID created by the system when you create an association. An
association is a binding between a document and a set of targets with a
schedule.


=head2 AssociationName => Str

The association name.


=head2 AssociationVersion => Str

The association version.


=head2 DocumentVersion => Str

The version of the document used in the association. If you change a
document version for a State Manager association, Systems Manager
immediately runs the association unless you previously specifed the
C<apply-only-at-cron-interval> parameter.

State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new
version of a document if that document is shared from another account.
State Manager always runs the C<default> version of a document if
shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console
shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an
association using a new version of a document shared form another
account, you must set the document version to C<default>.


=head2 Duration => Int

The number of hours that an association can run on specified targets.
After the resulting cutoff time passes, associations that are currently
running are cancelled, and no pending executions are started on
remaining targets.


=head2 InstanceId => Str

The managed node ID.


=head2 LastExecutionDate => Str

The date on which the association was last run.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the SSM document.


=head2 Overview => L<Paws::SSM::AssociationOverview>

Information about the association.


=head2 ScheduleExpression => Str

A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the association runs.
The schedule runs in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).


=head2 ScheduleOffset => Int

Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association.


=head2 TargetMaps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetMap>]

A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.


=head2 Targets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Target>]

The managed nodes targeted by the request to create an association. You
can target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by
specifying the C<InstanceIds> key with a value of C<*>.
