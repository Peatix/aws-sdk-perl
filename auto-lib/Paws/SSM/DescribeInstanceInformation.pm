=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::DescribeInstanceInformation - Arguments for method DescribeInstanceInformation on L<Paws::SSM>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeInstanceInformation on the
L<Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM)|Paws::SSM> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeInstanceInformation.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeInstanceInformation.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $ssm = Paws->service('SSM');
    my $DescribeInstanceInformationResult = $ssm->DescribeInstanceInformation(
      Filters => [
        {
          Key    => 'MyInstanceInformationStringFilterKey',    # min: 1
          Values => [
            'MyInstanceInformationFilterValue', ...            # min: 1
          ],    # min: 1, max: 100

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      InstanceInformationFilterList => [
        {
          Key => 'InstanceIds'
          , # values: InstanceIds, AgentVersion, PingStatus, PlatformTypes, ActivationIds, IamRole, ResourceType, AssociationStatus
          ValueSet => [
            'MyInstanceInformationFilterValue', ...    # min: 1
          ],    # min: 1, max: 100

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      MaxResults => 1,                # OPTIONAL
      NextToken  => 'MyNextToken',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $InstanceInformationList =
      $DescribeInstanceInformationResult->InstanceInformationList;
    my $NextToken = $DescribeInstanceInformationResult->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::SSM::DescribeInstanceInformationResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::InstanceInformationStringFilter>]

One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of
managed nodes. You can filter based on tags applied to your managed
nodes. Tag filters can't be combined with other filter types. Use this
C<Filters> data type instead of C<InstanceInformationFilterList>, which
is deprecated.



=head2 InstanceInformationFilterList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::InstanceInformationFilter>]

This is a legacy method. We recommend that you don't use this method.
Instead, use the C<Filters> data type. C<Filters> enables you to return
node information by filtering based on tags applied to managed nodes.

Attempting to use C<InstanceInformationFilterList> and C<Filters> leads
to an exception error.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of items to return for this call. The call also
returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
next set of results. The default value is 10 items.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The token for the next set of items to return. (You received this token
from a previous call.)
