A resource policy helps you to define the IAM entity (for example, an
Amazon Web Services account) that can manage your Systems Manager
resources. Currently, C<OpsItemGroup> is the only resource that
supports Systems Manager resource policies. The resource policy for
C<OpsItemGroup> enables Amazon Web Services accounts to view and
interact with OpsCenter operational work items (OpsItems).
