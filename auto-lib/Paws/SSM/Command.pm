=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::Command

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::Command object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmConfiguration => $value, ..., TriggeredAlarms => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::Command object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a command request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlarmConfiguration => L<Paws::SSM::AlarmConfiguration>

The details for the CloudWatch alarm applied to your command.


=head2 CloudWatchOutputConfig => L<Paws::SSM::CloudWatchOutputConfig>

Amazon CloudWatch Logs information where you want Amazon Web Services
Systems Manager to send the command output.


=head2 CommandId => Str

A unique identifier for this command.


=head2 Comment => Str

User-specified information about the command, such as a brief
description of what the command should do.


=head2 CompletedCount => Int

The number of targets for which the command invocation reached a
terminal state. Terminal states include the following: Success, Failed,
Execution Timed Out, Delivery Timed Out, Cancelled, Terminated, or
Undeliverable.


=head2 DeliveryTimedOutCount => Int

The number of targets for which the status is Delivery Timed Out.


=head2 DocumentName => Str

The name of the document requested for execution.


=head2 DocumentVersion => Str

The Systems Manager document (SSM document) version.


=head2 ErrorCount => Int

The number of targets for which the status is Failed or Execution Timed
Out.


=head2 ExpiresAfter => Str

If a command expires, it changes status to C<DeliveryTimedOut> for all
invocations that have the status C<InProgress>, C<Pending>, or
C<Delayed>. C<ExpiresAfter> is calculated based on the total timeout
for the overall command. For more information, see Understanding
command timeout values
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console#monitor-about-status-timeouts)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 InstanceIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The managed node IDs against which this command was requested.


=head2 MaxConcurrency => Str

The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run the command
at the same time. You can specify a number of managed nodes, such as
10, or a percentage of nodes, such as 10%. The default value is 50. For
more information about how to use C<MaxConcurrency>, see Amazon Web
Services Systems Manager Run Command
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/run-command.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 MaxErrors => Str

The maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops sending
the command to additional targets. You can specify a number of errors,
such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such as 10%. The default value
is C<0>. For more information about how to use C<MaxErrors>, see Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager Run Command
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/run-command.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 NotificationConfig => L<Paws::SSM::NotificationConfig>

Configurations for sending notifications about command status changes.


=head2 OutputS3BucketName => Str

The S3 bucket where the responses to the command executions should be
stored. This was requested when issuing the command.


=head2 OutputS3KeyPrefix => Str

The S3 directory path inside the bucket where the responses to the
command executions should be stored. This was requested when issuing
the command.


=head2 OutputS3Region => Str

(Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The system
ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically determines the
Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::SSM::Parameters>

The parameter values to be inserted in the document when running the
command.


=head2 RequestedDateTime => Str

The date and time the command was requested.


=head2 ServiceRole => Str

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role that Run Command,
a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, uses to act on your
behalf when sending notifications about command status changes.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the command.


=head2 StatusDetails => Str

A detailed status of the command execution. C<StatusDetails> includes
more information than C<Status> because it includes states resulting
from error and concurrency control parameters. C<StatusDetails> can
show different results than Status. For more information about these
statuses, see Understanding command statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>. StatusDetails
can be one of the following values:

=over

=item *

Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

=item *

In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one managed node but
hasn't reached a final state on all managed nodes.

=item *

Success: The command successfully ran on all invocations. This is a
terminal state.

=item *

Delivery Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations
shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations
shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Failed: The value of MaxErrors or more command invocations shows a
status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed nodes and one or
more invocations doesn't have a value of Success but not enough
invocations failed for the status to be Failed. This is a terminal
state.

=item *

Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is
a terminal state.

=item *

Rate Exceeded: The number of managed nodes targeted by the command
exceeded the account limit for pending invocations. The system has
canceled the command before running it on any managed node. This is a
terminal state.

=item *

Delayed: The system attempted to send the command to the managed node
but wasn't successful. The system retries again.

=back



=head2 TargetCount => Int

The number of targets for the command.


=head2 Targets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Target>]

An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
Key,Value combination that you specify. Targets is required if you
don't provide one or more managed node IDs in the call.


=head2 TimeoutSeconds => Int

The C<TimeoutSeconds> value specified for a command.


=head2 TriggeredAlarms => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::AlarmStateInformation>]

The CloudWatch alarm that was invoked by the command.
