=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionPreview

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionPreview object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Regions => $value, ..., TotalAccounts => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionPreview object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Regions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the results of the execution preview.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Regions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Information about the Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by the
execution preview.


=head2 StepPreviews => L<Paws::SSM::StepPreviewMap>

Information about the type of impact a runbook step would have on a
resource.

=over

=item *

C<Mutating>: The runbook step would make changes to the targets through
actions that create, modify, or delete resources.

=item *

C<Non_Mutating>: The runbook step would retrieve data about resources
but not make changes to them. This category generally includes
C<Describe*>, C<List*>, C<Get*>, and similar read-only API actions.

=item *

C<Undetermined>: An undetermined step invokes executions performed by
another orchestration service like Lambda, Step Functions, or Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager Run Command. An undetermined step might
also call a third-party API. Systems Manager Automation doesn't know
the outcome of the orchestration processes or third-party API
executions, so the results of the steps are undetermined.

=back



=head2 TargetPreviews => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetPreview>]

Information that provides a preview of what the impact of running the
specified Automation runbook would be.


=head2 TotalAccounts => Int

Information about the Amazon Web Services accounts that were included
in the execution preview.
