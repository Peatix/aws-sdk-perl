=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::OpsItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::OpsItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActualEndTime => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::OpsItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActualEndTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services
Systems Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate
operational work items (OpsItems) impacting the performance and health
of their Amazon Web Services resources. OpsCenter is integrated with
Amazon EventBridge and Amazon CloudWatch. This means you can configure
these services to automatically create an OpsItem in OpsCenter when a
CloudWatch alarm enters the ALARM state or when EventBridge processes
an event from any Amazon Web Services service that publishes events.
Configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms and EventBridge events to
automatically create OpsItems allows you to quickly diagnose and
remediate issues with Amazon Web Services resources from a single
console.

To help you diagnose issues, each OpsItem includes contextually
relevant information such as the name and ID of the Amazon Web Services
resource that generated the OpsItem, alarm or event details, alarm
history, and an alarm timeline graph. For the Amazon Web Services
resource, OpsCenter aggregates information from Config, CloudTrail
logs, and EventBridge, so you don't have to navigate across multiple
console pages during your investigation. For more information, see
Amazon Web Services Systems Manager OpsCenter
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ActualEndTime => Str

The time a runbook workflow ended. Currently reported only for the
OpsItem type C</aws/changerequest>.


=head2 ActualStartTime => Str

The time a runbook workflow started. Currently reported only for the
OpsItem type C</aws/changerequest>.


=head2 Category => Str

An OpsItem category. Category options include: Availability, Cost,
Performance, Recovery, Security.


=head2 CreatedBy => Str

The ARN of the Amazon Web Services account that created the OpsItem.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The date and time the OpsItem was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The OpsItem description.


=head2 LastModifiedBy => Str

The ARN of the Amazon Web Services account that last updated the
OpsItem.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The date and time the OpsItem was last updated.


=head2 Notifications => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::OpsItemNotification>]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Amazon Simple Notification Service
(Amazon SNS) topic where notifications are sent when this OpsItem is
edited or changed.


=head2 OperationalData => L<Paws::SSM::OpsItemOperationalData>

Operational data is custom data that provides useful reference details
about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, error
strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or other relevant data.
You enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a maximum
length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20 KB.

Operational data keys I<can't> begin with the following: C<amazon>,
C<aws>, C<amzn>, C<ssm>, C</amazon>, C</aws>, C</amzn>, C</ssm>.

You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the
account or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that
all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as provided by the
DescribeOpsItems API operation) can view and search on the specified
data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only viewable by users
who have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the GetOpsItem API
operation).

Use the C</aws/resources> key in OperationalData to specify a related
resource in the request. Use the C</aws/automations> key in
OperationalData to associate an Automation runbook with the OpsItem. To
view Amazon Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys, see
Creating OpsItems manually
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/OpsCenter-manually-create-OpsItems.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 OpsItemArn => Str

The OpsItem Amazon Resource Name (ARN).


=head2 OpsItemId => Str

=head2 OpsItemType => Str

The type of OpsItem. Systems Manager supports the following types of
OpsItems:

=over

=item *

C</aws/issue>

This type of OpsItem is used for default OpsItems created by OpsCenter.

=item *
