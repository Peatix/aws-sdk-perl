=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowTask

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowTask object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmConfiguration => $value, ..., WindowTaskId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowTask object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a task defined for a maintenance window.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlarmConfiguration => L<Paws::SSM::AlarmConfiguration>

The details for the CloudWatch alarm applied to your maintenance window
task.


=head2 CutoffBehavior => Str

The specification for whether tasks should continue to run after the
cutoff time specified in the maintenance windows is reached.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the task.


=head2 LoggingInfo => L<Paws::SSM::LoggingInfo>

Information about an S3 bucket to write task-level logs to.

C<LoggingInfo> has been deprecated. To specify an Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use the
C<OutputS3BucketName> and C<OutputS3KeyPrefix> options in the
C<TaskInvocationParameters> structure. For information about how Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager handles these options for the supported
maintenance window task types, see
MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.


=head2 MaxConcurrency => Str

The maximum number of targets this task can be run for, in parallel.

Although this element is listed as "Required: No", a value can be
omitted only when you are registering or updating a targetless task
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)
You must provide a value in all other cases.

For maintenance window tasks without a target specified, you can't
supply a value for this option. Instead, the system inserts a
placeholder value of C<1>. This value doesn't affect the running of
your task.


=head2 MaxErrors => Str

The maximum number of errors allowed before this task stops being
scheduled.

Although this element is listed as "Required: No", a value can be
omitted only when you are registering or updating a targetless task
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)
You must provide a value in all other cases.

For maintenance window tasks without a target specified, you can't
supply a value for this option. Instead, the system inserts a
placeholder value of C<1>. This value doesn't affect the running of
your task.


=head2 Name => Str

The task name.


=head2 Priority => Int

The priority of the task in the maintenance window. The lower the
number, the higher the priority. Tasks that have the same priority are
scheduled in parallel.


=head2 ServiceRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role for Amazon Web
Services Systems Manager to assume when running a maintenance window
task. If you do not specify a service role ARN, Systems Manager uses a
service-linked role in your account. If no appropriate service-linked
role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created when you
run C<RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow>.

However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recommend
creating a custom policy and custom service role for running your
maintenance window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only the
permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks. For
more information, see Setting up Maintenance Windows
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-maintenance-permissions.html)
in the in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 Targets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Target>]

The targets (either managed nodes or tags). Managed nodes are specified
using
C<Key=instanceids,Values=E<lt>instanceid1E<gt>,E<lt>instanceid2E<gt>>.
Tags are specified using C<Key=E<lt>tag nameE<gt>,Values=E<lt>tag
valueE<gt>>.


=head2 TaskArn => Str

The resource that the task uses during execution. For C<RUN_COMMAND>
and C<AUTOMATION> task types, C<TaskArn> is the Amazon Web Services
Systems Manager (SSM document) name or ARN. For C<LAMBDA> tasks, it's
the function name or ARN. For C<STEP_FUNCTIONS> tasks, it's the state
machine ARN.


=head2 TaskParameters => L<Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowTaskParameters>

The parameters that should be passed to the task when it is run.

C<TaskParameters> has been deprecated. To specify parameters to pass to
a task when it runs, instead use the C<Parameters> option in the
C<TaskInvocationParameters> structure. For information about how
Systems Manager handles these options for the supported maintenance
window task types, see MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of task.


=head2 WindowId => Str

The ID of the maintenance window where the task is registered.


=head2 WindowTaskId => Str

The task ID.
