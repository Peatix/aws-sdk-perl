=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionInputs

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionInputs object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Parameters => $value, ..., Targets => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::AutomationExecutionInputs object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Parameters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the optional inputs that can be specified for an
automation execution preview.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::SSM::AutomationParameterMap>

Information about parameters that can be specified for the preview
operation.


=head2 TargetLocations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetLocation>]

Information about the Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
Services accounts targeted by the Automation execution preview
operation.


=head2 TargetLocationsURL => Str

A publicly accessible URL for a file that contains the
C<TargetLocations> body. Currently, only files in presigned Amazon S3
buckets are supported.


=head2 TargetMaps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetMap>]

A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.


=head2 TargetParameterName => Str

The name of the parameter used as the target resource for the
rate-controlled execution. Required if you specify targets.


=head2 Targets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Target>]

Information about the resources that would be included in the actual
runbook execution, if it were to be run. Both Targets and TargetMaps
can't be specified together.
