=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::BaselineOverride

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::BaselineOverride object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApprovalRules => $value, ..., Sources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::BaselineOverride object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApprovalRules

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the basic information about a patch baseline override.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApprovalRules => L<Paws::SSM::PatchRuleGroup>




=head2 ApprovedPatches => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.

For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches
and rejected patches, see Package name formats for approved and
rejected patch lists
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 ApprovedPatchesComplianceLevel => Str

Defines the compliance level for approved patches. When an approved
patch is reported as missing, this value describes the severity of the
compliance violation.


=head2 ApprovedPatchesEnableNonSecurity => Bool

Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security
updates that should be applied to the managed nodes. The default value
is C<false>. Applies to Linux managed nodes only.


=head2 AvailableSecurityUpdatesComplianceStatus => Str

Indicates whether managed nodes for which there are available
security-related patches that have not been approved by the baseline
are being defined as C<COMPLIANT> or C<NON_COMPLIANT>. This option is
specified when the C<CreatePatchBaseline> or C<UpdatePatchBaseline>
commands are run.

Applies to Windows Server managed nodes only.


=head2 GlobalFilters => L<Paws::SSM::PatchFilterGroup>




=head2 OperatingSystem => Str

The operating system rule used by the patch baseline override.


=head2 RejectedPatches => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of explicitly rejected patches for the baseline.

For information about accepted formats for lists of approved patches
and rejected patches, see Package name formats for approved and
rejected patch lists
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-approved-rejected-package-name-formats.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 RejectedPatchesAction => Str

The action for Patch Manager to take on patches included in the
C<RejectedPackages> list. A patch can be allowed only if it is a
dependency of another package, or blocked entirely along with packages
that include it as a dependency.


=head2 Sources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::PatchSource>]

Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes,
including target operating systems and source repositories. Applies to
Linux managed nodes only.
