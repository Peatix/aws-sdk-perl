=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::CreateAssociationBatchRequestEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::CreateAssociationBatchRequestEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmConfiguration => $value, ..., Targets => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::CreateAssociationBatchRequestEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the association of a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
document (SSM document) and a managed node.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlarmConfiguration => L<Paws::SSM::AlarmConfiguration>




=head2 ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval => Bool

By default, when you create a new association, the system runs it
immediately after it is created and then according to the schedule you
specified and when target changes are detected. Specify C<true> for
C<ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval> if you want the association to run only
according to the schedule you specified.

For more information, see Understanding when associations are applied
to resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#state-manager-about-scheduling)
and E<gt>About target updates with Automation runbooks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/state-manager-about.html#runbook-target-updates)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.

This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.


=head2 AssociationName => Str

Specify a descriptive name for the association.


=head2 AutomationTargetParameterName => Str

Specify the target for the association. This target is required for
associations that use an Automation runbook and target resources by
using rate controls. Automation is a tool in Amazon Web Services
Systems Manager.


=head2 CalendarNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type
documents your associations are gated under. The associations only run
when that Change Calendar is open. For more information, see Amazon Web
Services Systems Manager Change Calendar
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-change-calendar)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 ComplianceSeverity => Str

The severity level to assign to the association.


=head2 DocumentVersion => Str

The document version.


=head2 Duration => Int

The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled.
Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any
pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken
offline for the association to run, it is made available again
immediately, without a reboot.

The C<Duration> parameter applies only when both these conditions are
true:

=over

=item *

The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable
according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation
runbook associated with this execution.

=item *

The command specifies the C< ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAssociationBatchRequestEntry.html#systemsmanager-Type-CreateAssociationBatchRequestEntry-ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval)
> parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately
after it is created, but only according to the specified schedule.

=back



=head2 InstanceId => Str

The managed node ID.

C<InstanceId> has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an
association, use the C<Targets> parameter. Requests that include the
parameter C<InstanceID> with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents)
that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use
the parameter C<InstanceId>, you can't use the parameters
C<AssociationName>, C<DocumentVersion>, C<MaxErrors>,
C<MaxConcurrency>, C<OutputLocation>, or C<ScheduleExpression>. To use
these parameters, you must use the C<Targets> parameter.


=head2 MaxConcurrency => Str

The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the
same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of
the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means
all targets run the association at the same time.

If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while
Systems Manager is running C<MaxConcurrency> associations, the
association is allowed to run. During the next association interval,
the new managed node will process its association within the limit
specified for C<MaxConcurrency>.


=head2 MaxErrors => Str

The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending
requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify
either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of
the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the
system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you
specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error
is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set
C<MaxError> to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the
sixth error is received.

Executions that are already running an association when C<MaxErrors> is
reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail
as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors
failed executions, set C<MaxConcurrency> to 1 so that executions
proceed one at a time.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the SSM document that contains the configuration
information for the managed node. You can specify Command or Automation
runbooks.

You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you
created, or a document that is shared with you from another account.

For SSM documents that are shared with you from other Amazon Web
Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in
the following format:

C<arn:aws:ssm:I<region>:I<account-id>:document/I<document-name>>

For example:

C<arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document>

For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
For example, C<AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline> or C<My-Document>.


=head2 OutputLocation => L<Paws::SSM::InstanceAssociationOutputLocation>

An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::SSM::Parameters>

A description of the parameters for a document.


=head2 ScheduleExpression => Str

A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the association runs.


=head2 ScheduleOffset => Int

Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association.


=head2 SyncCompliance => Str

The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify C<AUTO>
or C<MANUAL>. In C<AUTO> mode, the system uses the status of the
association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
association execution runs successfully, then the association is
C<COMPLIANT>. If the association execution doesn't run successfully,
the association is C<NON-COMPLIANT>.

In C<MANUAL> mode, you must specify the C<AssociationId> as a parameter
for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data
isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems
Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems
API operation.

By default, all associations use C<AUTO> mode.


=head2 TargetLocations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetLocation>]

Use this action to create an association in multiple Regions and
multiple accounts.


=head2 TargetMaps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::TargetMap>]

A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.


=head2 Targets => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SSM::Target>]

The managed nodes targeted by the request.
