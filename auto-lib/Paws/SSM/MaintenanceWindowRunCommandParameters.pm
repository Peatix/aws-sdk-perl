=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowRunCommandParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowRunCommandParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CloudWatchOutputConfig => $value, ..., TimeoutSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::MaintenanceWindowRunCommandParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CloudWatchOutputConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters for a C<RUN_COMMAND> task type.

For information about specifying and updating task parameters, see
RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow and UpdateMaintenanceWindowTask.

C<LoggingInfo> has been deprecated. To specify an Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) bucket to contain logs, instead use the
C<OutputS3BucketName> and C<OutputS3KeyPrefix> options in the
C<TaskInvocationParameters> structure. For information about how Amazon
Web Services Systems Manager handles these options for the supported
maintenance window task types, see
MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.

C<TaskParameters> has been deprecated. To specify parameters to pass to
a task when it runs, instead use the C<Parameters> option in the
C<TaskInvocationParameters> structure. For information about how
Systems Manager handles these options for the supported maintenance
window task types, see MaintenanceWindowTaskInvocationParameters.

For C<RUN_COMMAND> tasks, Systems Manager uses specified values for
C<TaskParameters> and C<LoggingInfo> only if no values are specified
for C<TaskInvocationParameters>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CloudWatchOutputConfig => L<Paws::SSM::CloudWatchOutputConfig>




=head2 Comment => Str

Information about the commands to run.


=head2 DocumentHash => Str

The SHA-256 or SHA-1 hash created by the system when the document was
created. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.


=head2 DocumentHashType => Str

SHA-256 or SHA-1. SHA-1 hashes have been deprecated.


=head2 DocumentVersion => Str

The Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM document) version
to use in the request. You can specify C<$DEFAULT>, C<$LATEST>, or a
specific version number. If you run commands by using the Amazon Web
Services CLI, then you must escape the first two options by using a
backslash. If you specify a version number, then you don't need to use
the backslash. For example:

C<--document-version "\$DEFAULT">

C<--document-version "\$LATEST">

C<--document-version "3">


=head2 NotificationConfig => L<Paws::SSM::NotificationConfig>

Configurations for sending notifications about command status changes
on a per-managed node basis.


=head2 OutputS3BucketName => Str

The name of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.


=head2 OutputS3KeyPrefix => Str

The S3 bucket subfolder.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::SSM::Parameters>

The parameters for the C<RUN_COMMAND> task execution.


=head2 ServiceRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role for Amazon Web
Services Systems Manager to assume when running a maintenance window
task. If you do not specify a service role ARN, Systems Manager uses a
service-linked role in your account. If no appropriate service-linked
role for Systems Manager exists in your account, it is created when you
run C<RegisterTaskWithMaintenanceWindow>.

However, for an improved security posture, we strongly recommend
creating a custom policy and custom service role for running your
maintenance window tasks. The policy can be crafted to provide only the
permissions needed for your particular maintenance window tasks. For
more information, see Setting up Maintenance Windows
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-maintenance-permissions.html)
in the in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.


=head2 TimeoutSeconds => Int

If this time is reached and the command hasn't already started running,
it doesn't run.
