=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::Target

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::Target object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::Target object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
key-value pair that you specify.

One or more targets must be specified for maintenance window Run
Command-type tasks. Depending on the task, targets are optional for
other maintenance window task types (Automation, Lambda, and Step
Functions). For more information about running tasks that don't specify
targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks without targets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/maintenance-windows-targetless-tasks.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.

Supported formats include the following.

B<For all Systems Manager tools:>

=over

C<Key=tag-key,Values=tag-value-1,tag-value-2>

=item *

C<Key=ResourceGroup,Values=resource-group-name>

C<Key=ParameterValues,Values=value-1,value-2,value-3>

=item *

To target all instances in the Amazon Web Services Region:

B<For Run Command and Maintenance Windows:>

For more information about how to send commands that target managed
nodes using C<Key,Value> parameters, see Targeting multiple managed
nodes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/send-commands-multiple.html#send-commands-targeting)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Key => Str

User-defined criteria for sending commands that target managed nodes
that meet the criteria.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

User-defined criteria that maps to C<Key>. For example, if you
specified C<tag:ServerRole>, you could specify C<value:WebServer> to
run a command on instances that include EC2 tags of
C<ServerRole,WebServer>.

Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values for a key
might be lower than the global maximum of 50.
