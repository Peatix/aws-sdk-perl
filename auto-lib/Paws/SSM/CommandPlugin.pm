=head1 NAME

Paws::SSM::CommandPlugin

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SSM::CommandPlugin object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., StatusDetails => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SSM::CommandPlugin object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes plugin details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the plugin. Must be one of the following:
C<aws:updateAgent>, C<aws:domainjoin>, C<aws:applications>,
C<aws:runPowerShellScript>, C<aws:psmodule>, C<aws:cloudWatch>,
C<aws:runShellScript>, or C<aws:updateSSMAgent>.


=head2 Output => Str

Output of the plugin execution.


=head2 OutputS3BucketName => Str

The S3 bucket where the responses to the command executions should be
stored. This was requested when issuing the command. For example, in
the following response:

C<amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-prefix/i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE/awsrunShellScript>

C<amzn-s3-demo-bucket> is the name of the S3 bucket;

C<my-prefix> is the name of the S3 prefix;

C<i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE> is the managed node ID;

C<awsrunShellScript> is the name of the plugin.


=head2 OutputS3KeyPrefix => Str

The S3 directory path inside the bucket where the responses to the
command executions should be stored. This was requested when issuing
the command. For example, in the following response:

C<amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-prefix/i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE/awsrunShellScript>

C<amzn-s3-demo-bucket> is the name of the S3 bucket;

C<my-prefix> is the name of the S3 prefix;

C<i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE> is the managed node ID;

C<awsrunShellScript> is the name of the plugin.


=head2 OutputS3Region => Str

(Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter. The system
ignores it. Instead, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager automatically
determines the S3 bucket region.


=head2 ResponseCode => Int

A numeric response code generated after running the plugin.


=head2 ResponseFinishDateTime => Str

The time the plugin stopped running. Could stop prematurely if, for
example, a cancel command was sent.


=head2 ResponseStartDateTime => Str

The time the plugin started running.


=head2 StandardErrorUrl => Str

The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to stderr. If
execution isn't yet complete, then this string is empty.


=head2 StandardOutputUrl => Str

The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to stdout in Amazon
S3. If the S3 bucket for the command wasn't specified, then this string
is empty.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of this plugin. You can run a document with multiple
plugins.


=head2 StatusDetails => Str

A detailed status of the plugin execution. C<StatusDetails> includes
more information than Status because it includes states resulting from
error and concurrency control parameters. StatusDetails can show
different results than Status. For more information about these
statuses, see Understanding command statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/monitor-commands.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide>. StatusDetails
can be one of the following values:

=over

=item *

Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.

=item *

In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed node but hasn't
reached a terminal state.

=item *

Success: The execution of the command or plugin was successfully
completed. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Delivery Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to the managed node
before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery timeouts don't count
against the parent command's C<MaxErrors> limit, but they do contribute
to whether the parent command status is Success or Incomplete. This is
a terminal state.

=item *

Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the managed node, but
the execution wasn't complete before the execution timeout expired.
Execution timeouts count against the C<MaxErrors> limit of the parent
command. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed node. For a
plugin, this indicates that the result code wasn't zero. For a command
invocation, this indicates that the result code for one or more plugins
wasn't zero. Invocation failures count against the MaxErrors limit of
the parent command. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed. This is
a terminal state.

=item *

Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the managed node. The
managed node might not exist, or it might not be responding.
Undeliverable invocations don't count against the parent command's
MaxErrors limit, and they don't contribute to whether the parent
command status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

=item *

Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit and
subsequent command invocations were canceled by the system. This is a
terminal state.
