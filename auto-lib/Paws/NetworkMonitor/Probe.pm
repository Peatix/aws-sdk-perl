=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkMonitor::Probe

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkMonitor::Probe object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddressFamily => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkMonitor::Probe object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddressFamily

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes information about a network monitor probe.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddressFamily => Str

The IPv4 or IPv6 address for the probe.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time and date the probe was created.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destination => Str

The destination for the probe. This should be either an C<IPV4> or
C<IPV6>.


=head2 DestinationPort => Int

The destination port for the probe. This is required only if the
C<protocol> is C<TCP> and must be a number between C<1> and C<65536>.


=head2 ModifiedAt => Str

The time and date that the probe was last modified.


=head2 PacketSize => Int

The size of the packets traveling between the C<source> and
C<destination>. This must be a number between C<56> and


=head2 ProbeArn => Str

The ARN of the probe.


=head2 ProbeId => Str

The ID of the probe.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protocol => Str

The network protocol for the destination. This can be either C<TCP> or
C<ICMP>. If the protocol is C<TCP>, then C<port> is also required.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceArn => Str

The ARN of the probe source subnet.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the probe.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::NetworkMonitor::TagMap>

The list of key-value pairs created and assigned to the probe.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The ID of the source VPC subnet.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::NetworkMonitor>
