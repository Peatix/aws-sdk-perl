=head1 NAME

Paws::EMRContainers::VirtualCluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EMRContainers::VirtualCluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EMRContainers::VirtualCluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This entity describes a virtual cluster. A virtual cluster is a
Kubernetes namespace that Amazon EMR is registered with. Amazon EMR
uses virtual clusters to run jobs and host endpoints. Multiple virtual
clusters can be backed by the same physical cluster. However, each
virtual cluster maps to one namespace on an Amazon EKS cluster. Virtual
clusters do not create any active resources that contribute to your
bill or that require lifecycle management outside the service.
