=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::HdfsNameNode

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::HdfsNameNode object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Hostname => $value, ..., Port => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::HdfsNameNode object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Hostname

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The NameNode of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The NameNode
manages the file system's namespace. The NameNode performs operations
such as opening, closing, and renaming files and directories. The
NameNode contains the information to map blocks of data to the
DataNodes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Hostname => Str

The hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS cluster. This value is the IP
address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the NameNode. An agent
that's installed on-premises uses this hostname to communicate with the
NameNode in the network.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Port => Int

The port that the NameNode uses to listen to client requests.
