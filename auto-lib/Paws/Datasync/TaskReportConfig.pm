=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::TaskReportConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::TaskReportConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., ReportLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::TaskReportConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies how you want to configure a task report, which provides
detailed information about for your DataSync transfer.

For more information, see Task reports
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-reports.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => L<Paws::Datasync::ReportDestination>

Specifies the Amazon S3 bucket where DataSync uploads your task report.
For more information, see Task reports
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-reports.html#task-report-access).


=head2 ObjectVersionIds => Str

Specifies whether your task report includes the new version of each
object transferred into an S3 bucket. This only applies if you enable
versioning on your bucket
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-versioning-examples.html).
Keep in mind that setting this to C<INCLUDE> can increase the duration
of your task execution.


=head2 OutputType => Str

Specifies the type of task report that you want:

=over

=item *

C<SUMMARY_ONLY>: Provides necessary details about your task, including
the number of files, objects, and directories transferred and transfer
duration.

=item *

C<STANDARD>: Provides complete details about your task, including a
full list of files, objects, and directories that were transferred,
skipped, verified, and more.

=back



=head2 Overrides => L<Paws::Datasync::ReportOverrides>

Customizes the reporting level for aspects of your task report. For
example, your report might generally only include errors, but you could
specify that you want a list of successes and errors just for the files
that DataSync attempted to delete in your destination location.


=head2 ReportLevel => Str

Specifies whether you want your task report to include only what went
wrong with your transfer or a list of what succeeded and didn't.

=over

=item *

C<ERRORS_ONLY>: A report shows what DataSync was unable to transfer,
skip, verify, and delete.

=item *

C<SUCCESSES_AND_ERRORS>: A report shows what DataSync was able and
unable to transfer, skip, verify, and delete.
