=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::TaskSchedule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::TaskSchedule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ScheduleExpression => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::TaskSchedule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ScheduleExpression

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configures your DataSync task to run on a schedule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-scheduling.html)
(at a minimum interval of 1 hour).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduleExpression => Str

Specifies your task schedule by using a cron or rate expression.

Use cron expressions for task schedules that run on a specific time and
day. For example, the following cron expression creates a task schedule
that runs at 8 AM on the first Wednesday of every month:

C<cron(0 8 * * 3#1)>

Use rate expressions for task schedules that run on a regular interval.
For example, the following rate expression creates a task schedule that
runs every 12 hours:

C<rate(12 hours)>

For information about cron and rate expression syntax, see the I<Amazon
EventBridge User Guide>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-scheduled-rule-pattern.html).


=head2 Status => Str

Specifies whether to enable or disable your task schedule. Your
schedule is enabled by default, but there can be situations where you
need to disable it. For example, you might need to pause a recurring
transfer to fix an issue with your task or perform maintenance on your
storage system.

DataSync might disable your schedule automatically if your task fails
repeatedly with the same error. For more information, see
TaskScheduleDetails
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_TaskScheduleDetails.html).
