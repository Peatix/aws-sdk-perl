=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::FsxProtocolSmb

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::FsxProtocolSmb object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Domain => $value, ..., User => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::FsxProtocolSmb object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Domain

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol configuration that
DataSync uses to access your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system's
storage virtual machine (SVM). For more information, see Providing
DataSync access to FSx for ONTAP file systems
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-access).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Domain => Str

Specifies the name of the Windows domain that your storage virtual
machine (SVM) belongs to.

If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring this
setting makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SVM.

If you have multiple Active Directory domains in your environment,
configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the
right SVM.


=head2 MountOptions => L<Paws::Datasync::SmbMountOptions>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Password => Str

Specifies the password of a user who has permission to access your SVM.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> User => Str

Specifies a user that can mount and access the files, folders, and
metadata in your SVM.

For information about choosing a user with the right level of access
for your transfer, see Using the SMB protocol
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb).
