=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::P95Metrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::P95Metrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IOPS => $value, ..., Throughput => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::P95Metrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IOPS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The types of performance data that DataSync Discovery collects about an
on-premises storage system resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IOPS => L<Paws::Datasync::IOPS>

The IOPS peaks for an on-premises storage system resource. Each data
point represents the 95th percentile peak value during a 1-hour
interval.


=head2 Latency => L<Paws::Datasync::Latency>

The latency peaks for an on-premises storage system resource. Each data
point represents the 95th percentile peak value during a 1-hour
interval.


=head2 Throughput => L<Paws::Datasync::Throughput>

The throughput peaks for an on-premises storage system resource. Each
data point represents the 95th percentile peak value during a 1-hour
interval.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Datasync>
