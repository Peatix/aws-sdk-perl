=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::PrivateLinkConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::PrivateLinkConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PrivateLinkEndpoint => $value, ..., VpcEndpointId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::PrivateLinkConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PrivateLinkEndpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies how your DataSync agent connects to Amazon Web Services using
a virtual private cloud (VPC) service endpoint
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choose-service-endpoint.html#choose-service-endpoint-vpc).
An agent that uses a VPC endpoint isn't accessible over the public
internet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PrivateLinkEndpoint => Str

Specifies the VPC endpoint provided by Amazon Web Services PrivateLink
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-share-your-services.html)
that your agent connects to.


=head2 SecurityGroupArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the security group that
provides DataSync access to your VPC endpoint. You can only specify one
ARN.


=head2 SubnetArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the ARN of the subnet where your VPC endpoint is located. You
can only specify one ARN.


=head2 VpcEndpointId => Str

Specifies the ID of the VPC endpoint that your agent connects to.
