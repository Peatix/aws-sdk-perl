=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::TaskFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::TaskFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::TaskFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You can use API filters to narrow down the list of resources returned
by C<ListTasks>. For example, to retrieve all tasks on a source
location, you can use C<ListTasks> with filter name C<LocationId> and
C<Operator Equals> with the ARN for the location.

For more information, see filtering DataSync resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/query-resources.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the filter being used. Each API call supports a list of
filters that are available for it. For example, C<LocationId> for
C<ListTasks>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Operator => Str

The operator that is used to compare filter values (for example,
C<Equals> or C<Contains>).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The values that you want to filter for. For example, you might want to
display only tasks for a specific destination location.
