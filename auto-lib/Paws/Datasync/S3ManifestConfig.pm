=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::S3ManifestConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::S3ManifestConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BucketAccessRoleArn => $value, ..., S3BucketArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::S3ManifestConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BucketAccessRoleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BucketAccessRoleArn => Str

Specifies the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows
DataSync to access your manifest. For more information, see Providing

=head2 B<REQUIRED> ManifestObjectPath => Str

Specifies the Amazon S3 object key of your manifest. This can include a
prefix (for example, C<prefix/my-manifest.csv>).


=head2 ManifestObjectVersionId => Str

Specifies the object version ID of the manifest that you want DataSync
to use. If you don't set this, DataSync uses the latest version of the
object.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3BucketArn => Str

Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the S3 bucket where you're
hosting your manifest.
