=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::Options

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::Options object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Atime => $value, ..., VerifyMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::Options object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Atime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Indicates how your transfer task is configured. These options include
how DataSync handles files, objects, and their associated metadata
during your transfer. You also can specify how to verify data
integrity, set bandwidth limits for your task, among other options.

Each option has a default value. Unless you need to, you don't have to
configure any option before calling StartTaskExecution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_StartTaskExecution.html).

You also can override your task options for each task execution. For
example, you might want to adjust the C<LogLevel> for an individual
execution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Atime => Str

Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time a file
was read or written to.

The behavior of C<Atime> isn't fully standard across platforms, so
DataSync can only do this on a best-effort basis.

=over

=item *

C<BEST_EFFORT> (default) - DataSync attempts to preserve the original
C<Atime> attribute on all source files (that is, the version before the
C<PREPARING> steps of the task execution). This option is recommended.

=item *

C<NONE> - Ignores C<Atime>.

=back

If C<Atime> is set to C<BEST_EFFORT>, C<Mtime> must be set to
C<PRESERVE>.

If C<Atime> is set to C<NONE>, C<Mtime> must also be C<NONE>.


=head2 BytesPerSecond => Int

Limits the bandwidth used by a DataSync task. For example, if you want
DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to C<1048576>
(C<=1024*1024>).

Not applicable to Enhanced mode tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html).


=head2 Gid => Str

Specifies the POSIX group ID (GID) of the file's owners.

=over

=item *

C<INT_VALUE> (default) - Preserves the integer value of user ID (UID)
and GID, which is recommended.

=item *

C<NONE> - Ignores UID and GID.

=back

For more information, see Understanding how DataSync handles file and
object metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html).


=head2 LogLevel => Str

Specifies the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a Amazon
CloudWatch Logs log group. To specify the log group, see
CloudWatchLogGroupArn
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateTask.html#DataSync-CreateTask-request-CloudWatchLogGroupArn).

=over

=item *

C<BASIC> - Publishes logs with only basic information (such as transfer
errors).

=item *

C<TRANSFER> - Publishes logs for all files or objects that your
DataSync task transfers and performs data-integrity checks on.

=item *

C<OFF> - No logs are published.

=back



=head2 Mtime => Str

Specifies whether to preserve metadata indicating the last time that a
file was written to before the C<PREPARING> step of your task
execution. This option is required when you need to run the a task more
than once.

=over

=item *

C<PRESERVE> (default) - Preserves original C<Mtime>, which is
recommended.

=item *

C<NONE> - Ignores C<Mtime>.

=back

If C<Mtime> is set to C<PRESERVE>, C<Atime> must be set to
C<BEST_EFFORT>.

If C<Mtime> is set to C<NONE>, C<Atime> must also be set to C<NONE>.


=head2 ObjectTags => Str

Specifies whether you want DataSync to C<PRESERVE> object tags (default
behavior) when transferring between object storage systems. If you want
your DataSync task to ignore object tags, specify the C<NONE> value.


=head2 OverwriteMode => Str

Specifies whether DataSync should modify or preserve data at the
destination location.

=over

=item *

C<ALWAYS> (default) - DataSync modifies data in the destination
location when source data (including metadata) has changed.

If DataSync overwrites objects, you might incur additional charges for
certain Amazon S3 storage classes (for example, for retrieval or early
deletion). For more information, see Storage class considerations with
Amazon S3 transfers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes).

=item *

C<NEVER> - DataSync doesn't overwrite data in the destination location
even if the source data has changed. You can use this option to protect
against overwriting changes made to files or objects in the
destination.

=back



=head2 PosixPermissions => Str

Specifies which users or groups can access a file for a specific
purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file.

For more information, see Understanding how DataSync handles file and
object metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html).

=over

=item *

C<PRESERVE> (default) - Preserves POSIX-style permissions, which is
recommended.

=item *

C<NONE> - Ignores POSIX-style permissions.

=back

DataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.


=head2 PreserveDeletedFiles => Str

Specifies whether files in the destination location that don't exist in
the source should be preserved. This option can affect your Amazon S3
storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum
storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed
information, see Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage
classes in DataSync
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes).

=over

=item *

C<PRESERVE> (default) - Ignores such destination files, which is
recommended.

=item *

C<REMOVE> - Deletes destination files that arenE<rsquo>t present in the
source.

=back

If you set this parameter to C<REMOVE>, you can't set C<TransferMode>
to C<ALL>. When you transfer all data, DataSync doesn't scan your
destination location and doesn't know what to delete.


=head2 PreserveDevices => Str

Specifies whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and
character devices in the source location and recreate the files with
that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync copies only
the name and metadata of such devices.

DataSync can't copy the actual contents of these devices because
they're nonterminal and don't return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.

=over

=item *

C<NONE> (default) - Ignores special devices (recommended).

=item *

C<PRESERVE> - Preserves character and block device metadata. This
option currently isn't supported for Amazon EFS.

=back



=head2 SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags => Str

Specifies which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied
from source to destination objects.

This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for
Windows File Server locations or between two FSx for Windows File
Server locations. For more information, see Understanding how DataSync
handles file and object metadata
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/metadata-copied.html).

=over

=item *

C<OWNER_DACL> (default) - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
following metadata:

=over

=item *

The object owner.

=item *

NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine
whether to grant access to an object.

DataSync won't copy NTFS system access control lists (SACLs) with this
option.

=back

=item *

C<OWNER_DACL_SACL> - For each copied object, DataSync copies the
following metadata:

=over

=item *

The object owner.

=item *

NTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine
whether to grant access to an object.

=item *

SACLs, which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a
secured object.

Copying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows
user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information
about choosing a user with the right permissions, see required
permissions for SMB
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-smb-location.html#configuring-smb-permissions),
FSx for Windows File Server
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-fsx-location.html#create-fsx-windows-location-permissions),
or FSx for ONTAP
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-ontap-location.html#create-ontap-location-smb)
(depending on the type of location in your transfer).

=back

=item *

C<NONE> - None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied.
Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for
accessing the destination location. DACLs and SACLs are set based on
the destination serverE<rsquo>s configuration.

=back



=head2 TaskQueueing => Str

Specifies whether your transfer tasks should be put into a queue during
certain scenarios when running multiple tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#running-multiple-tasks).
This is C<ENABLED> by default.


=head2 TransferMode => Str

Specifies whether DataSync transfers only the data (including metadata)
that differs between locations following an initial copy or transfers
all data every time you run the task. If you're planning on recurring
transfers, you might only want to transfer what's changed since your
previous task execution.

=over

=item *

C<CHANGED> (default) - After your initial full transfer, DataSync
copies only the data and metadata that differs between the source and
destination location.

=item *

C<ALL> - DataSync copies everything in the source to the destination
without comparing differences between the locations.

=back



=head2 Uid => Str

Specifies the POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner.

=over

=item *

C<INT_VALUE> (default) - Preserves the integer value of UID and group
ID (GID), which is recommended.

=item *

C<NONE> - Ignores UID and GID.

=back

For more information, see Metadata copied by DataSync
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/special-files.html#metadata-copied).


=head2 VerifyMode => Str

Specifies if and how DataSync checks the integrity of your data at the
end of your transfer.

=over

=item *

C<ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED> (recommended) - DataSync calculates the
checksum of transferred data (including metadata) at the source
location. At the end of the transfer, DataSync then compares this
checksum to the checksum calculated on that data at the destination.

This is the default option for Enhanced mode tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html).

We recommend this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible
Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more
information, see Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes).

=item *

C<POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT> - At the end of the transfer, DataSync
checks the entire source and destination to verify that both locations
are fully synchronized.

The is the default option for Basic mode tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/choosing-task-mode.html)
and isn't currently supported with Enhanced mode tasks.

If you use a manifest
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/transferring-with-manifest.html),
DataSync only scans and verifies what's listed in the manifest.

You can't use this option when transferring to S3 Glacier Flexible
Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes. For more
information, see Storage class considerations with Amazon S3 locations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-s3-location.html#using-storage-classes).

=item *

C<NONE> - DataSync performs data integrity checks only during your
transfer. Unlike other options, there's no additional verification at
the end of your transfer.
