=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::TaskScheduleDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DisabledBy => $value, ..., StatusUpdateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::TaskScheduleDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DisabledBy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides information about your DataSync task schedule
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-scheduling.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DisabledBy => Str

Indicates how your task schedule was disabled.

=over

=item *

C<USER> - Your schedule was manually disabled by using the UpdateTask
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_UpdateTask.html)
operation or DataSync console.

=item *

C<SERVICE> - Your schedule was automatically disabled by DataSync
because the task failed repeatedly with the same error.

=back



=head2 DisabledReason => Str

Provides a reason if the task schedule is disabled.

If your schedule is disabled by C<USER>, you see a C<Manually disabled
by user.> message.

If your schedule is disabled by C<SERVICE>, you see an error message to
help you understand why the task keeps failing. For information on
resolving DataSync errors, see Troubleshooting issues with DataSync
transfers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-datasync-locations-tasks.html).


=head2 StatusUpdateTime => Str

Indicates the last time the status of your task schedule changed. For
example, if DataSync automatically disables your schedule because of a
repeated error, you can see when the schedule was disabled.
