=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPCluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPCluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CifsShareCount => $value, ..., ResourceId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPCluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CifsShareCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The information that DataSync Discovery collects about an on-premises
storage system cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CifsShareCount => Int

The number of CIFS shares in the cluster.


=head2 ClusterBlockStorageLogicalUsed => Int

The storage space that's being used in the cluster without accounting
for compression or deduplication.


=head2 ClusterBlockStorageSize => Int

The total storage space that's available in the cluster.


=head2 ClusterBlockStorageUsed => Int

The storage space that's being used in a cluster.


=head2 ClusterCloudStorageUsed => Int

The amount of space in the cluster that's in cloud storage (for
example, if you're using data tiering).


=head2 ClusterName => Str

The name of the cluster.


=head2 LunCount => Int

The number of LUNs (logical unit numbers) in the cluster.


=head2 MaxP95Performance => L<Paws::Datasync::MaxP95Performance>

The performance data that DataSync Discovery collects about the
cluster.


=head2 NfsExportedVolumes => Int

The number of NFS volumes in the cluster.


=head2 Recommendations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Datasync::Recommendation>]

The Amazon Web Services storage services that DataSync Discovery
recommends for the cluster. For more information, see Recommendations
provided by DataSync Discovery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/discovery-understand-recommendations.html).


=head2 RecommendationStatus => Str

Indicates whether DataSync Discovery recommendations for the cluster
are ready to view, incomplete, or can't be determined.

For more information, see Recommendation statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/discovery-job-statuses.html#recommendation-statuses-table).


=head2 ResourceId => Str

The universally unique identifier (UUID) of the cluster.
