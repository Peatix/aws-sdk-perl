=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::SmbMountOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::SmbMountOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Version => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::SmbMountOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol that
DataSync uses to access an SMB file server.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Version => Str

By default, DataSync automatically chooses an SMB protocol version
based on negotiation with your SMB file server. You also can configure
DataSync to use a specific SMB version, but we recommend doing this
only if DataSync has trouble negotiating with the SMB file server
automatically.

These are the following options for configuring the SMB version:

=over

=item *

C<AUTOMATIC> (default): DataSync and the SMB file server negotiate the
highest version of SMB that they mutually support between 2.1 and
3.1.1.

This is the recommended option. If you instead choose a specific
version that your file server doesn't support, you may get an
C<Operation Not Supported> error.

=item *

C<SMB3>: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 3.0.2.

=item *

C<SMB2>: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.1.

=item *

C<SMB2_0>: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 2.0.

=item *

C<SMB1>: Restricts the protocol negotiation to only SMB version 1.0.

The C<SMB1> option isn't available when creating an Amazon FSx for
NetApp ONTAP location
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/API_CreateLocationFsxOntap.html).
