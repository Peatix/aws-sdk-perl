=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::Capacity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::Capacity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClusterCloudStorageUsed => $value, ..., Used => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::Capacity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClusterCloudStorageUsed

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The storage capacity of an on-premises storage system resource (for
example, a volume).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClusterCloudStorageUsed => Int

The amount of space in the cluster that's in cloud storage (for
example, if you're using data tiering).


=head2 LogicalUsed => Int

The amount of space that's being used in a storage system resource
without accounting for compression or deduplication.


=head2 Provisioned => Int

The total amount of space available in a storage system resource.


=head2 Used => Int

The amount of space that's being used in a storage system resource.
