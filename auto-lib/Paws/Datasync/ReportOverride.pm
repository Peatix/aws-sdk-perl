=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::ReportOverride

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::ReportOverride object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReportLevel => $value, ..., ReportLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::ReportOverride object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReportLevel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the level of detail for a particular aspect of your DataSync
task report
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/task-reports.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReportLevel => Str

Specifies whether your task report includes errors only or successes
and errors.

For example, your report might mostly include only what didn't go well
in your transfer (C<ERRORS_ONLY>). At the same time, you want to verify
that your task filter
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/filtering.html)
is working correctly. In this situation, you can get a list of what
files DataSync successfully skipped and if something transferred that
you didn't to transfer (C<SUCCESSES_AND_ERRORS>).
