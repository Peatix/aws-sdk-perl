=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPVolume

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPVolume object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CapacityProvisioned => $value, ..., VolumeName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::NetAppONTAPVolume object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CapacityProvisioned

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The information that DataSync Discovery collects about a volume in your
on-premises storage system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CapacityProvisioned => Int

The total storage space that's available in the volume.


=head2 CapacityUsed => Int

The storage space that's being used in the volume.


=head2 CifsShareCount => Int

The number of CIFS shares in the volume.


=head2 LogicalCapacityUsed => Int

The storage space that's being used in the volume without accounting
for compression or deduplication.


=head2 LunCount => Int

The number of LUNs (logical unit numbers) in the volume.


=head2 MaxP95Performance => L<Paws::Datasync::MaxP95Performance>

The performance data that DataSync Discovery collects about the volume.


=head2 NfsExported => Bool

The number of NFS volumes in the volume.


=head2 Recommendations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Datasync::Recommendation>]

The Amazon Web Services storage services that DataSync Discovery
recommends for the volume. For more information, see Recommendations
provided by DataSync Discovery
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/discovery-understand-recommendations.html).


=head2 RecommendationStatus => Str

Indicates whether DataSync Discovery recommendations for the volume are
ready to view, incomplete, or can't be determined.

For more information, see Recommendation statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/discovery-job-statuses.html#recommendation-statuses-table).


=head2 ResourceId => Str

The universally unique identifier (UUID) of the volume.


=head2 SecurityStyle => Str

The volume's security style (such as Unix or NTFS).


=head2 SnapshotCapacityUsed => Int

The amount of storage in the volume that's being used for snapshots.


=head2 SvmName => Str

The name of the SVM associated with the volume.


=head2 SvmUuid => Str

The UUID of the storage virtual machine (SVM) associated with the
volume.


=head2 VolumeName => Str
