=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::Ec2Config

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::Ec2Config object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { SecurityGroupArns => $value, ..., SubnetArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::Ec2Config object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->SecurityGroupArns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The subnet and security groups that DataSync uses to connect to one of
your Amazon EFS file system's mount targets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/accessing-fs.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SecurityGroupArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specifies the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups
associated with an Amazon EFS file system's mount target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubnetArn => Str

Specifies the ARN of a subnet where DataSync creates the network
interfaces
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/datasync-network.html#required-network-interfaces)
for managing traffic during your transfer.

The subnet must be located:

=over

=item *

In the same virtual private cloud (VPC) as the Amazon EFS file system.

=item *

In the same Availability Zone as at least one mount target for the
Amazon EFS file system.

=back

You don't need to specify a subnet that includes a file system mount
target.
