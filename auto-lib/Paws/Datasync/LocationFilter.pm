=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::LocationFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::LocationFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::LocationFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Narrow down the list of resources returned by C<ListLocations>. For
example, to see all your Amazon S3 locations, create a filter using
C<"Name": "LocationType">, C<"Operator": "Equals">, and C<"Values":
"S3">.

For more information, see filtering resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/query-resources.html).

C<Equals> or C<Contains>).
