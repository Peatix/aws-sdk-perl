=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::Latency

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::Latency object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Other => $value, ..., Write => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::Latency object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Other

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The latency peaks for an on-premises storage system resource. Each data
point represents the 95th percentile peak value during a 1-hour
interval.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Other => Num

Peak latency for operations unrelated to read and write operations.


=head2 Read => Num

Peak latency for read operations.


=head2 Write => Num

Peak latency for write operations.
