=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::TaskExecutionResultDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::TaskExecutionResultDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorCode => $value, ..., VerifyStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::TaskExecutionResultDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides detailed information about the result of your DataSync task
execution.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorCode => Str

An error that DataSync encountered during your task execution. You can
use this information to help troubleshoot issues
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-datasync-locations-tasks.html).


=head2 ErrorDetail => Str

The detailed description of an error that DataSync encountered during
your task execution. You can use this information to help troubleshoot
issues
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-datasync-locations-tasks.html).


=head2 PrepareDuration => Int

The time in milliseconds that your task execution was in the
C<PREPARING> step. For more information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).

For Enhanced mode tasks, the value is always C<0>. For more
information, see How DataSync prepares your data transfer
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/how-datasync-transfer-works.html#how-datasync-prepares).


=head2 PrepareStatus => Str

The status of the C<PREPARING> step for your task execution. For more
information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).


=head2 TotalDuration => Int

The time in milliseconds that your task execution ran.


=head2 TransferDuration => Int

The time in milliseconds that your task execution was in the
C<TRANSFERRING> step. For more information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).

For Enhanced mode tasks, the value is always C<0>. For more
information, see How DataSync transfers your data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/how-datasync-transfer-works.html#how-datasync-transfers).


=head2 TransferStatus => Str

The status of the C<TRANSFERRING> step for your task execution. For
more information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).


=head2 VerifyDuration => Int

The time in milliseconds that your task execution was in the
C<VERIFYING> step. For more information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).

For Enhanced mode tasks, the value is always C<0>. For more
information, see How DataSync verifies your data's integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/how-datasync-transfer-works.html#how-verifying-works).


=head2 VerifyStatus => Str

The status of the C<VERIFYING> step for your task execution. For more
information, see Task execution statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/run-task.html#understand-task-execution-statuses).
