=head1 NAME

Paws::Datasync::NfsMountOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Datasync::NfsMountOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Version => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Datasync::NfsMountOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Version

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies how DataSync can access a location using the NFS protocol.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Version => Str

Specifies the NFS version that you want DataSync to use when mounting
your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version specified, the
task fails.

You can specify the following options:

=over

=item *

C<AUTOMATIC> (default): DataSync chooses NFS version 4.1.

=item *

C<NFS3>: Stateless protocol version that allows for asynchronous writes
on the server.

=item *

C<NFSv4_0>: Stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that supports
delegations and pseudo file systems.

=item *

C<NFSv4_1>: Stateful protocol version that supports sessions, directory
delegations, and parallel data processing. NFS version 4.1 also
includes all features available in version 4.0.

=back

DataSync currently only supports NFS version 3 with Amazon FSx for
NetApp ONTAP locations.
