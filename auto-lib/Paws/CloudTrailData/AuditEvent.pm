=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrailData::AuditEvent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EventData => $value, ..., Id => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrailData::AuditEvent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EventData

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An event from a source outside of Amazon Web Services that you want
CloudTrail to log.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventData => Str

The content of an audit event that comes from the event, such as
C<userIdentity>, C<userAgent>, and C<eventSource>.


=head2 EventDataChecksum => Str

A checksum is a base64-SHA256 algorithm that helps you verify that
CloudTrail receives the event that matches with the checksum. Calculate
the checksum by running a command like the following:

C<printf %s I<$eventdata> | openssl dgst -binary -sha256 | base64>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

The original event ID from the source event.
