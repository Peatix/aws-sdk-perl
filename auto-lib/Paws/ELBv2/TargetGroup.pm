=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::TargetGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ELBv2::TargetGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HealthCheckEnabled => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ELBv2::TargetGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HealthCheckEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a target group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HealthCheckEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether health checks are enabled.


=head2 HealthCheckIntervalSeconds => Int

The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an
individual target.


=head2 HealthCheckPath => Str

The destination for health checks on the targets.


=head2 HealthCheckPort => Str

The port to use to connect with the target.


=head2 HealthCheckProtocol => Str

The protocol to use to connect with the target. The GENEVE, TLS, UDP,
and TCP_UDP protocols are not supported for health checks.


=head2 HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds => Int

The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed
health check.


=head2 HealthyThresholdCount => Int

The number of consecutive health checks successes required before
considering an unhealthy target healthy.


=head2 IpAddressType => Str

The IP address type. The default value is C<ipv4>.


=head2 LoadBalancerArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer that routes traffic
to this target group. You can use each target group with only one load
balancer.


=head2 Matcher => L<Paws::ELBv2::Matcher>

The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking for a successful response
from a target.


=head2 Port => Int

The port on which the targets are listening. This parameter is not used
if the target is a Lambda function.


=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocol to use for routing traffic to the targets.


=head2 ProtocolVersion => Str

[HTTP/HTTPS protocol] The protocol version. The possible values are
C<GRPC>, C<HTTP1>, and C<HTTP2>.


=head2 TargetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.


=head2 TargetGroupName => Str

The name of the target group.


=head2 TargetType => Str

The type of target that you must specify when registering targets with
this target group. The possible values are C<instance> (register
targets by instance ID), C<ip> (register targets by IP address),
C<lambda> (register a single Lambda function as a target), or C<alb>
(register a single Application Load Balancer as a target).


=head2 UnhealthyThresholdCount => Int

The number of consecutive health check failures required before
considering the target unhealthy.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The ID of the VPC for the targets.
