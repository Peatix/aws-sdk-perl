=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::AvailabilityZone

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ELBv2::AvailabilityZone object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LoadBalancerAddresses => $value, ..., ZoneName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ELBv2::AvailabilityZone object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LoadBalancerAddresses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about an Availability Zone.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LoadBalancerAddresses => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ELBv2::LoadBalancerAddress>]

[Network Load Balancers] If you need static IP addresses for your load
balancer, you can specify one Elastic IP address per Availability Zone
when you create an internal-facing load balancer. For internal load
balancers, you can specify a private IP address from the IPv4 range of
the subnet.


=head2 OutpostId => Str

[Application Load Balancers on Outposts] The ID of the Outpost.


=head2 SourceNatIpv6Prefixes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

[Network Load Balancers with UDP listeners] The IPv6 prefixes to use
for source NAT. For each subnet, specify an IPv6 prefix (/80 netmask)
from the subnet CIDR block or C<auto_assigned> to use an IPv6 prefix
selected at random from the subnet CIDR block.


=head2 SubnetId => Str

The ID of the subnet. You can specify one subnet per Availability Zone.


=head2 ZoneName => Str

The name of the Availability Zone.
