=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::Matcher

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ELBv2::Matcher object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GrpcCode => $value, ..., HttpCode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ELBv2::Matcher object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GrpcCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The codes to use when checking for a successful response from a target.
If the protocol version is gRPC, these are gRPC codes. Otherwise, these
are HTTP codes.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GrpcCode => Str

You can specify values between 0 and 99. You can specify multiple
values (for example, "0,1") or a range of values (for example, "0-5").
The default value is 12.


=head2 HttpCode => Str

For Application Load Balancers, you can specify values between 200 and
499, with the default value being 200. You can specify multiple values
(for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299").

For Network Load Balancers, you can specify values between 200 and 599,
with the default value being 200-399. You can specify multiple values
(for example, "200,202") or a range of values (for example, "200-299").

For Gateway Load Balancers, this must be "200E<ndash>399".

Note that when using shorthand syntax, some values such as commas need
to be escaped.
