=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::ModifyTargetGroup - Arguments for method ModifyTargetGroup on L<Paws::ELBv2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ModifyTargetGroup on the
L<Elastic Load Balancing|Paws::ELBv2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ModifyTargetGroup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ModifyTargetGroup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $elasticloadbalancing = Paws->service('ELBv2');
  # To modify the health check configuration for a target group
  # This example changes the configuration of the health checks used to evaluate
  # the health of the targets for the specified target group.
    my $ModifyTargetGroupOutput = $elasticloadbalancing->ModifyTargetGroup(
      'HealthCheckPort'     => 443,
      'HealthCheckProtocol' => 'HTTPS',
      'TargetGroupArn'      =>
'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-https-targets/2453ed029918f21f'
    );

    # Results:
    my $TargetGroups = $ModifyTargetGroupOutput->TargetGroups;

    # Returns a L<Paws::ELBv2::ModifyTargetGroupOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/elasticloadbalancing/ModifyTargetGroup>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HealthCheckEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether health checks are enabled.



=head2 HealthCheckIntervalSeconds => Int

The approximate amount of time, in seconds, between health checks of an
individual target.



=head2 HealthCheckPath => Str

[HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The destination for health checks on the
targets.

[HTTP1 or HTTP2 protocol version] The ping path. The default is /.

[GRPC protocol version] The path of a custom health check method with
the format /package.service/method. The default is /Amazon Web
Services.ALB/healthcheck.



=head2 HealthCheckPort => Str

The port the load balancer uses when performing health checks on
targets.



=head2 HealthCheckProtocol => Str

The protocol the load balancer uses when performing health checks on
targets. For Application Load Balancers, the default is HTTP. For
Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, the default is TCP.
The TCP protocol is not supported for health checks if the protocol of
the target group is HTTP or HTTPS. It is supported for health checks
only if the protocol of the target group is TCP, TLS, UDP, or TCP_UDP.
The GENEVE, TLS, UDP, and TCP_UDP protocols are not supported for
health checks.

Valid values are: C<"HTTP">, C<"HTTPS">, C<"TCP">, C<"TLS">, C<"UDP">, C<"TCP_UDP">, C<"GENEVE">

=head2 HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds => Int

[HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The amount of time, in seconds, during which
no response means a failed health check.



=head2 HealthyThresholdCount => Int

The number of consecutive health checks successes required before
considering an unhealthy target healthy.



=head2 Matcher => L<Paws::ELBv2::Matcher>

[HTTP/HTTPS health checks] The HTTP or gRPC codes to use when checking
for a successful response from a target. For target groups with a
protocol of TCP, TCP_UDP, UDP or TLS the range is 200-599. For target
groups with a protocol of HTTP or HTTPS, the range is 200-499. For
target groups with a protocol of GENEVE, the range is 200-399.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target group.



=head2 UnhealthyThresholdCount => Int

The number of consecutive health check failures required before
considering the target unhealthy.
