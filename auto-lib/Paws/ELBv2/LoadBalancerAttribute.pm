=head1 NAME

Paws::ELBv2::LoadBalancerAttribute

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ELBv2::LoadBalancerAttribute object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ELBv2::LoadBalancerAttribute object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a load balancer attribute.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Key => Str

The name of the attribute.

The following attributes are supported by all load balancers:

=over

=item *

C<deletion_protection.enabled> - Indicates whether deletion protection
is enabled. The value is C<true> or C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled> - Indicates whether cross-zone
load balancing is enabled. The possible values are C<true> and
C<false>. The default for Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load
Balancers is C<false>. The default for Application Load Balancers is
C<true>, and can't be changed.

=back

The following attributes are supported by both Application Load
Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

=over

=item *

C<access_logs.s3.enabled> - Indicates whether access logs are enabled.
The value is C<true> or C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<access_logs.s3.bucket> - The name of the S3 bucket for the access
logs. This attribute is required if access logs are enabled. The bucket
must exist in the same region as the load balancer and have a bucket
policy that grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions to write to the
bucket.

=item *

C<access_logs.s3.prefix> - The prefix for the location in the S3 bucket
for the access logs.

=item *

C<ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic> - Blocks internet gateway (IGW) access to
the load balancer. It is set to C<false> for internet-facing load
balancers and C<true> for internal load balancers, preventing
unintended access to your internal load balancer through an internet
gateway.

=item *

C<zonal_shift.config.enabled> - Indicates whether zonal shift is
enabled. The possible values are C<true> and C<false>. The default is
C<false>.

=back

The following attributes are supported by only Application Load
Balancers:

=over

=item *

C<idle_timeout.timeout_seconds> - The idle timeout value, in seconds.
The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default is 60 seconds.

=item *

C<client_keep_alive.seconds> - The client keep alive value, in seconds.
The valid range is 60-604800 seconds. The default is 3600 seconds.

=item *

C<connection_logs.s3.enabled> - Indicates whether connection logs are
enabled. The value is C<true> or C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<connection_logs.s3.bucket> - The name of the S3 bucket for the
connection logs. This attribute is required if connection logs are
enabled. The bucket must exist in the same region as the load balancer
and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions
to write to the bucket.

=item *

C<connection_logs.s3.prefix> - The prefix for the location in the S3
bucket for the connection logs.

=item *

C<routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode> - Determines how the load
balancer handles requests that might pose a security risk to your
application. The possible values are C<monitor>, C<defensive>, and
C<strictest>. The default is C<defensive>.

=item *

C<routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled> - Indicates whether
HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed by the load
balancer (C<true>) or routed to targets (C<false>). The default is
C<false>.

=item *

C<routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled> - Indicates whether the
Application Load Balancer should preserve the C<Host> header in the
HTTP request and send it to the target without any change. The possible
values are C<true> and C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled> - Indicates
whether the two headers (C<x-amzn-tls-version> and
C<x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite>), which contain information about the
negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are added to the client
request before sending it to the target. The C<x-amzn-tls-version>
header has information about the TLS protocol version negotiated with
the client, and the C<x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite> header has information
about the cipher suite negotiated with the client. Both headers are in
OpenSSL format. The possible values for the attribute are C<true> and
C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled> - Indicates whether the
C<X-Forwarded-For> header should preserve the source port that the
client used to connect to the load balancer. The possible values are
C<true> and C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=item *

C<routing.http.xff_header_processing.mode> - Enables you to modify,
preserve, or remove the C<X-Forwarded-For> header in the HTTP request
before the Application Load Balancer sends the request to the target.
The possible values are C<append>, C<preserve>, and C<remove>. The
default is C<append>.

=over

=item *

If the value is C<append>, the Application Load Balancer adds the
client IP address (of the last hop) to the C<X-Forwarded-For> header in
the HTTP request before it sends it to targets.

=item *

If the value is C<preserve> the Application Load Balancer preserves the
C<X-Forwarded-For> header in the HTTP request, and sends it to targets
without any change.

=item *

If the value is C<remove>, the Application Load Balancer removes the
C<X-Forwarded-For> header in the HTTP request before it sends it to
targets.

=back

=item *

C<routing.http2.enabled> - Indicates whether HTTP/2 is enabled. The
possible values are C<true> and C<false>. The default is C<true>.
Elastic Load Balancing requires that message header names contain only
alphanumeric characters and hyphens.

=item *

C<waf.fail_open.enabled> - Indicates whether to allow a WAF-enabled
load balancer to route requests to targets if it is unable to forward
the request to Amazon Web Services WAF. The possible values are C<true>
and C<false>. The default is C<false>.

=back

The following attributes are supported by only Network Load Balancers:

=over

=item *

C<dns_record.client_routing_policy> - Indicates how traffic is
distributed among the load balancer Availability Zones. The possible
values are C<availability_zone_affinity> with 100 percent zonal
affinity, C<partial_availability_zone_affinity> with 85 percent zonal
affinity, and C<any_availability_zone> with 0 percent zonal affinity.

=back



=head2 Value => Str
