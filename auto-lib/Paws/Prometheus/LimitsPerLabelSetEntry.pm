=head1 NAME

Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSetEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSetEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxSeries => $value, ..., MaxSeries => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSetEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxSeries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the information about the limits that apply to
time series that match one label set.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxSeries => Int

The maximum number of active series that can be ingested that match
this label set.

Setting this to 0 causes no label set limit to be enforced, but it does
cause Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus to vend label set metrics
to CloudWatch
