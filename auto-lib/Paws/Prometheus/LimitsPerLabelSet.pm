=head1 NAME

Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LabelSet => $value, ..., Limits => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LabelSet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure defines one label set used to enforce ingestion limits
for the workspace, and defines the limit for that label set.

A label set is a unique combination of label-value pairs. Use them to
control time series ingestion limits and to monitor usage by specific
label groups. Example label sets might be C<team:finance> or
C<env:prod>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LabelSet => L<Paws::Prometheus::LabelSet>

This defines one label set that will have an enforced ingestion limit.

Label values accept ASCII characters and must contain at least one
character that isn't whitespace. ASCII control characters are not
accepted. If the label name is metric name label C<__I<name>__>, then
the I<metric> part of the name must conform to the following pattern:
C<[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Limits => L<Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSetEntry>

This structure contains the information about the limits that apply to
time series that match this label set.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Prometheus>
