=head1 NAME

Paws::Prometheus::WorkspaceConfigurationDescription

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Prometheus::WorkspaceConfigurationDescription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LimitsPerLabelSet => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Prometheus::WorkspaceConfigurationDescription object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LimitsPerLabelSet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the description of the workspace configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LimitsPerLabelSet => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Prometheus::LimitsPerLabelSet>]

=head2 RetentionPeriodInDays => Int

This field displays how many days that metrics are retained in the
workspace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => L<Paws::Prometheus::WorkspaceConfigurationStatus>

This structure displays the current status of the workspace
