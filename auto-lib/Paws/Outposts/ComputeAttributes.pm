=head1 NAME

Paws::Outposts::ComputeAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Outposts::ComputeAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HostId => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Outposts::ComputeAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HostId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about compute hardware assets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HostId => Str

The host ID of the Dedicated Host on the asset.


=head2 InstanceFamilies => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the names of instance families that are currently associated
with a given asset.


=head2 InstanceTypeCapacities => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Outposts::AssetInstanceTypeCapacity>]

The instance type capacities configured for this asset. This can be
changed through a capacity task.


=head2 MaxVcpus => Int

The maximum number of vCPUs possible for the specified asset.


=head2 State => Str

The state.

=over

=item *

ACTIVE - The asset is available and can provide capacity for new
compute resources.

=item *

ISOLATED - The asset is undergoing maintenance and can't provide
capacity for new compute resources. Existing compute resources on the
asset are not affected.

=item *

RETIRING - The underlying hardware for the asset is degraded. Capacity
for new compute resources is reduced. Amazon Web Services sends
notifications for resources that must be stopped before the asset can
be replaced.
