=head1 NAME

Paws::Outposts::RackPhysicalProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Outposts::RackPhysicalProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FiberOpticCableType => $value, ..., UplinkGbps => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Outposts::RackPhysicalProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FiberOpticCableType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the physical and logistical details for racks at
sites. For more information about hardware requirements for racks, see
Network readiness checklist
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-requirements.html#checklist)
in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FiberOpticCableType => Str

The type of fiber used to attach the Outpost to the network.


=head2 MaximumSupportedWeightLbs => Str

The maximum rack weight that this site can support. C<NO_LIMIT> is over
2000 lbs (907 kg).


=head2 OpticalStandard => Str

The type of optical standard used to attach the Outpost to the network.
This field is dependent on uplink speed, fiber type, and distance to
the upstream device. For more information about networking requirements
for racks, see Network
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-requirements.html#facility-networking)
in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide.


=head2 PowerConnector => Str

The power connector for the hardware.


=head2 PowerDrawKva => Str

The power draw available at the hardware placement position for the
rack.


=head2 PowerFeedDrop => Str

The position of the power feed.


=head2 PowerPhase => Str

The power option that you can provide for hardware.


=head2 UplinkCount => Str

The number of uplinks each Outpost network device.


=head2 UplinkGbps => Str

The uplink speed the rack supports for the connection to the Region.
