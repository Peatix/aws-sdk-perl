=head1 NAME

Paws::FIS::CreateExperimentTemplateTargetInput

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::FIS::CreateExperimentTemplateTargetInput object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Filters => $value, ..., SelectionMode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::FIS::CreateExperimentTemplateTargetInput object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Filters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a target for an experiment. You must specify at least one
Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or at least one resource tag. You cannot
specify both ARNs and tags.

For more information, see Targets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fis/latest/userguide/targets.html) in the
I<Fault Injection Service User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Filters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::FIS::ExperimentTemplateTargetInputFilter>]

The filters to apply to identify target resources using specific
attributes.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::FIS::ExperimentTemplateTargetParameterMap>

The resource type parameters.


=head2 ResourceArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the resources.


=head2 ResourceTags => L<Paws::FIS::TagMap>

The tags for the target resources.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceType => Str

The resource type. The resource type must be supported for the
specified action.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SelectionMode => Str

Scopes the identified resources to a specific count of the resources at
random, or a percentage of the resources. All identified resources are
included in the target.

=over

=item *

ALL - Run the action on all identified targets. This is the default.

=item *

COUNT(n) - Run the action on the specified number of targets, chosen
from the identified targets at random. For example, COUNT(1) selects
one of the targets.

=item *

PERCENT(n) - Run the action on the specified percentage of targets,
chosen from the identified targets at random. For example, PERCENT(25)
selects 25% of the targets.
