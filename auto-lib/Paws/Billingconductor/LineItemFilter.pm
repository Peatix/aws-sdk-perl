A representation of the line item filter for your custom line item. You
can use line item filters to include or exclude specific resource
values from the billing group's total cost. For example, if you create

Plan discounts, you can update C<LineItemFilter> to exclude it.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]
