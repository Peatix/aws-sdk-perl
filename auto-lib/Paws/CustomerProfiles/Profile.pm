=head1 NAME

Paws::CustomerProfiles::Profile

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CustomerProfiles::Profile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountNumber => $value, ..., ShippingAddress => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CustomerProfiles::Profile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountNumber

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 FoundByItems => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::FoundByKeyValue>]

A list of items used to find a profile returned in a SearchProfiles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_SearchProfiles.html)
response. An item is a key-value(s) pair that matches an attribute in
the profile.

If the optional C<AdditionalSearchKeys> parameter was included in the
SearchProfiles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_SearchProfiles.html)
request, the C<FoundByItems> list should be interpreted based on the
C<LogicalOperator> used in the request:

=over

=item *

C<AND> - The profile included in the response matched all of the search
keys specified in the request. The C<FoundByItems> will include all of
the key-value(s) pairs that were specified in the request (as this is a
requirement of C<AND> search logic).

=item *

C<OR> - The profile included in the response matched at least one of
the search keys specified in the request. The C<FoundByItems> will
include each of the key-value(s) pairs that the profile was found by.

=back

The C<OR> relationship is the default behavior if the
C<LogicalOperator> parameter is not included in the SearchProfiles
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/customerprofiles/latest/APIReference/API_SearchProfiles.html)
request.
