=head1 NAME

Paws::CustomerProfiles::ObjectTypeKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CustomerProfiles::ObjectTypeKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldNames => $value, ..., StandardIdentifiers => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CustomerProfiles::ObjectTypeKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that defines the Key element of a ProfileObject. A Key is a
special element that can be used to search for a customer profile.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FieldNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The reference for the key name of the fields map.


=head2 StandardIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The types of keys that a ProfileObject can have. Each ProfileObject can
have only 1 UNIQUE key but multiple PROFILE keys. PROFILE, ASSET, CASE,
or ORDER means that this key can be used to tie an object to a PROFILE,
ASSET, CASE, or ORDER respectively. UNIQUE means that it can be used to
uniquely identify an object. If a key a is marked as SECONDARY, it will
be used to search for profiles after all other PROFILE keys have been
searched. A LOOKUP_ONLY key is only used to match a profile but is not
persisted to be used for searching of the profile. A NEW_ONLY key is
only used if the profile does not already exist before the object is
ingested, otherwise it is only used for matching objects to profiles.
