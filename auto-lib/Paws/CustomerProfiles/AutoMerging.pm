=head1 NAME

Paws::CustomerProfiles::AutoMerging

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CustomerProfiles::AutoMerging object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConflictResolution => $value, ..., MinAllowedConfidenceScoreForMerging => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CustomerProfiles::AutoMerging object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConflictResolution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configuration settings for how to perform the auto-merging of profiles.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConflictResolution => L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::ConflictResolution>

How the auto-merging process should resolve conflicts between different
profiles. For example, if Profile A and Profile B have the same
C<FirstName> and C<LastName> (and that is the matching criteria), which
C<EmailAddress> should be used?


=head2 Consolidation => L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::Consolidation>

A list of matching attributes that represent matching criteria. If two
profiles meet at least one of the requirements in the matching
attributes list, they will be merged.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

The flag that enables the auto-merging of duplicate profiles.


=head2 MinAllowedConfidenceScoreForMerging => Num

A number between 0 and 1 that represents the minimum confidence score
required for profiles within a matching group to be merged during the
auto-merge process. A higher score means higher similarity required to
merge profiles.



=head1 SEE ALSO
