=head1 NAME

Paws::CustomerProfiles::MatchItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CustomerProfiles::MatchItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConfidenceScore => $value, ..., ProfileIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CustomerProfiles::MatchItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConfidenceScore

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Match group object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConfidenceScore => Num

A number between 0 and 1, where a higher score means higher similarity.
Examining match confidence scores lets you distinguish between groups
of similar records in which the system is highly confident (which you
may decide to merge), groups of similar records about which the system
is uncertain (which you may decide to have reviewed by a human), and
groups of similar records that the system deems to be unlikely (which
you may decide to reject). Given confidence scores vary as per the data
input, it should not be used an absolute measure of matching quality.


=head2 MatchId => Str

The unique identifiers for this group of profiles that match.


=head2 ProfileIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of identifiers for profiles that match.
