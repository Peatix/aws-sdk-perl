=head1 NAME

Paws::CustomerProfiles::RuleBasedMatchingRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CustomerProfiles::RuleBasedMatchingRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeTypesSelector => $value, ..., MaxAllowedRuleLevelForMerging => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CustomerProfiles::RuleBasedMatchingRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeTypesSelector

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The request to enable the rule-based matching.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttributeTypesSelector => L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::AttributeTypesSelector>

Configures information about the C<AttributeTypesSelector> where the
rule-based identity resolution uses to match profiles.


=head2 ConflictResolution => L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::ConflictResolution>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

The flag that enables the rule-based matching process of duplicate
profiles.


=head2 ExportingConfig => L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::ExportingConfig>




=head2 MatchingRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CustomerProfiles::MatchingRule>]

Configures how the rule-based matching process should match profiles.
You can have up to 15 C<MatchingRule> in the C<MatchingRules>.


=head2 MaxAllowedRuleLevelForMatching => Int

Indicates the maximum allowed rule level.


=head2 MaxAllowedRuleLevelForMerging => Int
