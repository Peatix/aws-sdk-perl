=head1 NAME

Paws::ACM::CertificateSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ACM::CertificateSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateArn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ACM::CertificateSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure is returned in the response object of ListCertificates
action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateArn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate. This is of the form:

C<arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012>

For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time at which the certificate was requested.


=head2 DomainName => Str

Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com or
example.com, for the certificate.


=head2 Exported => Bool

Indicates whether the certificate has been exported. This value exists
only when the certificate type is C<PRIVATE>.


=head2 ExtendedKeyUsages => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains a list of Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension objects. Each
object specifies a purpose for which the certificate public key can be
used and consists of a name and an object identifier (OID).


=head2 HasAdditionalSubjectAlternativeNames => Bool

When called by ListCertificates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latestAPIReference/API_ListCertificates.html),
indicates whether the full list of subject alternative names has been
included in the response. If false, the response includes all of the
subject alternative names included in the certificate. If true, the
response only includes the first 100 subject alternative names included
in the certificate. To display the full list of subject alternative
names, use DescribeCertificate
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latestAPIReference/API_DescribeCertificate.html).


=head2 ImportedAt => Str

The date and time when the certificate was imported. This value exists
only when the certificate type is C<IMPORTED>.


=head2 InUse => Bool

Indicates whether the certificate is currently in use by any Amazon Web
Services resources.


=head2 IssuedAt => Str

The time at which the certificate was issued. This value exists only
when the certificate type is C<AMAZON_ISSUED>.


=head2 KeyAlgorithm => Str

The algorithm that was used to generate the public-private key pair.


=head2 KeyUsages => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Key Usage X.509 v3 extension objects. Each object is a string
value that identifies the purpose of the public key contained in the
certificate. Possible extension values include DIGITAL_SIGNATURE,
KEY_ENCHIPHERMENT, NON_REPUDIATION, and more.


=head2 ManagedBy => Str

Identifies the Amazon Web Services service that manages the certificate
issued by ACM.


=head2 NotAfter => Str

The time after which the certificate is not valid.


=head2 NotBefore => Str

The time before which the certificate is not valid.


=head2 RenewalEligibility => Str

Specifies whether the certificate is eligible for renewal. At this
time, only exported private certificates can be renewed with the
RenewCertificate command.


=head2 RevokedAt => Str

The time at which the certificate was revoked. This value exists only
when the certificate status is C<REVOKED>.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the certificate.

A certificate enters status PENDING_VALIDATION upon being requested,
unless it fails for any of the reasons given in the troubleshooting
topic Certificate request fails
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/troubleshooting-failed.html).
ACM makes repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and
then times out. If a certificate shows status FAILED or
VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT, delete the request, correct the issue with DNS
validation
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html)
or Email validation
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/email-validation.html),
and try again. If validation succeeds, the certificate enters status
ISSUED.


=head2 SubjectAlternativeNameSummaries => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more domain names (subject alternative names) included in the
certificate. This list contains the domain names that are bound to the
public key that is contained in the certificate. The subject
alternative names include the canonical domain name (CN) of the
certificate and additional domain names that can be used to connect to
the website.

When called by ListCertificates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latestAPIReference/API_ListCertificates.html),
this parameter will only return the first 100 subject alternative names
included in the certificate. To display the full list of subject
alternative names, use DescribeCertificate
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latestAPIReference/API_DescribeCertificate.html).


=head2 Type => Str

The source of the certificate. For certificates provided by ACM, this
value is C<AMAZON_ISSUED>. For certificates that you imported with
ImportCertificate, this value is C<IMPORTED>. ACM does not provide
managed renewal
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html) for
imported certificates. For more information about the differences
between certificates that you import and those that ACM provides, see
Importing Certificates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
in the I<Certificate Manager User Guide>.
