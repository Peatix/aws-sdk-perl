=head1 NAME

Paws::BackupSearch::LongCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BackupSearch::LongCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Operator => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BackupSearch::LongCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Operator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The long condition contains a C<Value> and can optionally contain an
C<Operator>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Operator => Str

A string that defines what values will be returned.

If this is included, avoid combinations of operators that will return
all possible values. For example, including both C<EQUALS_TO> and
C<NOT_EQUALS_TO> with a value of C<4> will return all values.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Int

The value of an item included in one of the search item filters.
