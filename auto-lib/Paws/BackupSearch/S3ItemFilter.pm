=head1 NAME

Paws::BackupSearch::S3ItemFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BackupSearch::S3ItemFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTimes => $value, ..., VersionIds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BackupSearch::S3ItemFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTimes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains arrays of objects, which may include ObjectKeys, Sizes,
CreationTimes, VersionIds, and/or Etags.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTimes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::TimeCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one value is included, the results will return only items that match
the value.

If more than one value is included, the results will return all items
that match any of the values.


=head2 ETags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::StringCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one value is included, the results will return only items that match
the value.

If more than one value is included, the results will return all items
that match any of the values.


=head2 ObjectKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::StringCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one value is included, the results will return only items that match
the value.

If more than one value is included, the results will return all items
that match any of the values.


=head2 Sizes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::LongCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one value is included, the results will return only items that match
the value.

If more than one value is included, the results will return all items
that match any of the values.


=head2 VersionIds => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::StringCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one value is included, the results will return only items that match
the value.

If more than one value is included, the results will return all items
that match any of the values.
