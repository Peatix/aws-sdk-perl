=head1 NAME

Paws::BackupSearch::EBSItemFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::BackupSearch::EBSItemFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTimes => $value, ..., Sizes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::BackupSearch::EBSItemFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTimes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This contains arrays of objects, which may include CreationTimes time
condition objects, FilePaths string objects, LastModificationTimes time
condition objects,

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTimes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::TimeCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one is included, the results will return only items that match.

If more than one is included, the results will return all items that
match any of the included values.


=head2 FilePaths => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::StringCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one file path is included, the results will return only items that
match the file path.

If more than one file path is included, the results will return all
items that match any of the file paths.


=head2 LastModificationTimes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::TimeCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one is included, the results will return only items that match.

If more than one is included, the results will return all items that
match any of the included values.


=head2 Sizes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::BackupSearch::LongCondition>]

You can include 1 to 10 values.

If one is included, the results will return only items that match.

If more than one is included, the results will return all items that
match any of the included values.
