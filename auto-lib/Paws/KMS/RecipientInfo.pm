=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS::RecipientInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KMS::RecipientInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttestationDocument => $value, ..., KeyEncryptionAlgorithm => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KMS::RecipientInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttestationDocument

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about the party that receives the response from
the API operation.

This data type is designed to support Amazon Web Services Nitro
Enclaves, which lets you create an isolated compute environment in
Amazon EC2. For information about the interaction between KMS and
Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves, see How Amazon Web Services Nitro
Enclaves uses KMS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/services-nitro-enclaves.html)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttestationDocument => Str

The attestation document for an Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclave. This
document includes the enclave's public key.


=head2 KeyEncryptionAlgorithm => Str

The encryption algorithm that KMS should use with the public key for an
Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclave to encrypt plaintext values for the
response. The only valid value is C<RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256>.
