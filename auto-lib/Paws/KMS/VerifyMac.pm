=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS::VerifyMac - Arguments for method VerifyMac on L<Paws::KMS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method VerifyMac on the
L<AWS Key Management Service|Paws::KMS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method VerifyMac.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to VerifyMac.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $kms = Paws->service('KMS');
# To verify an HMAC
# This example verifies an HMAC for a particular message, HMAC KMS keys, and MAC
# algorithm. A value of 'true' in the MacValid value in the response indicates
# that the HMAC is valid.
    my $VerifyMacResponse = $kms->VerifyMac(
      'KeyId'        => '1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab',
      'Mac'          => '<HMAC_TAG>',
      'MacAlgorithm' => 'HMAC_SHA_384',
      'Message'      => 'Hello World'
    );

    # Results:
    my $KeyId        = $VerifyMacResponse->KeyId;
    my $MacAlgorithm = $VerifyMacResponse->MacAlgorithm;
    my $MacValid     = $VerifyMacResponse->MacValid;

    # Returns a L<Paws::KMS::VerifyMacResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/kms/VerifyMac>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DryRun => Bool

Checks if your request will succeed. C<DryRun> is an optional
parameter.

To learn more about how to use this parameter, see Testing your KMS API
calls
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/programming-dryrun.html)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.



=head2 GrantTokens => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of grant tokens.

Use a grant token when your permission to call this operation comes
from a new grant that has not yet achieved I<eventual consistency>. For
more information, see Grant token
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grants.html#grant_token)
and Using a grant token
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/grant-manage.html#using-grant-token)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyId => Str

The KMS key that will be used in the verification.

Enter a key ID of the KMS key that was used to generate the HMAC. If
you identify a different KMS key, the C<VerifyMac> operation fails.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Mac => Str

The HMAC to verify. Enter the HMAC that was generated by the
GenerateMac operation when you specified the same message, HMAC KMS
key, and MAC algorithm as the values specified in this request.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MacAlgorithm => Str

The MAC algorithm that will be used in the verification. Enter the same
MAC algorithm that was used to compute the HMAC. This algorithm must be
supported by the HMAC KMS key identified by the C<KeyId> parameter.

Valid values are: C<"HMAC_SHA_224">, C<"HMAC_SHA_256">, C<"HMAC_SHA_384">, C<"HMAC_SHA_512">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Message => Str

The message that will be used in the verification. Enter the same
message that was used to generate the HMAC.

GenerateMac and C<VerifyMac> do not provide special handling for
message digests. If you generated an HMAC for a hash digest of a
message, you must verify the HMAC for the same hash digest.
