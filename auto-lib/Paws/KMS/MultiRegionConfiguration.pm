=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS::MultiRegionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KMS::MultiRegionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MultiRegionKeyType => $value, ..., ReplicaKeys => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KMS::MultiRegionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MultiRegionKeyType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the configuration of this multi-Region key. This field
appears only when the KMS key is a primary or replica of a multi-Region
key.

For more information about any listed KMS key, use the DescribeKey
operation.

=head2 MultiRegionKeyType => Str

Indicates whether the KMS key is a C<PRIMARY> or C<REPLICA> key.


=head2 PrimaryKey => L<Paws::KMS::MultiRegionKey>

Displays the key ARN and Region of the primary key. This field includes
the current KMS key if it is the primary key.


=head2 ReplicaKeys => ArrayRef[L<Paws::KMS::MultiRegionKey>]

displays the key ARNs and Regions of all replica keys. This field
includes the current KMS key if it is a replica key.
