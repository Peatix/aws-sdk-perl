=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS::XksProxyConfigurationType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KMS::XksProxyConfigurationType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessKeyId => $value, ..., VpcEndpointServiceName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KMS::XksProxyConfigurationType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Detailed information about the external key store proxy (XKS proxy).
Your external key store proxy translates KMS requests into a format
that your external key manager can understand. These fields appear in a
DescribeCustomKeyStores response only when the C<CustomKeyStoreType> is
C<EXTERNAL_KEY_STORE>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessKeyId => Str

The part of the external key store proxy authentication credential
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_CreateCustomKeyStore.html#KMS-CreateCustomKeyStore-request-XksProxyAuthenticationCredential)
that uniquely identifies the secret access key.


=head2 Connectivity => Str

Indicates whether the external key store proxy uses a public endpoint
or an Amazon VPC endpoint service to communicate with KMS.


=head2 UriEndpoint => Str

The URI endpoint for the external key store proxy.

If the external key store proxy has a public endpoint, it is displayed
here.

If the external key store proxy uses an Amazon VPC endpoint service
name, this field displays the private DNS name associated with the VPC
endpoint service.


=head2 UriPath => Str

The path to the external key store proxy APIs.


=head2 VpcEndpointServiceName => Str

The Amazon VPC endpoint service used to communicate with the external
key store proxy. This field appears only when the external key store
proxy uses an Amazon VPC endpoint service to communicate with KMS.
