  $result->Att1->Id

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the external key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-external-key)that
is associated with a KMS key in an external key store.

This element appears in a CreateKey or DescribeKey response only for a
KMS key in an external key store.

The I<external key> is a symmetric encryption key that is hosted by an
external key manager outside of Amazon Web Services. When you use the
KMS key in an external key store in a cryptographic operation, the
cryptographic operation is performed in the external key manager using
the specified external key. For more information, see External key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/keystore-external.html#concept-external-key)
in the I<Key Management Service Developer Guide>.
