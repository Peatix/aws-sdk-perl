=head1 NAME

Paws::KMS::GrantListEntry

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::KMS::GrantListEntry object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Constraints => $value, ..., RetiringPrincipal => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::KMS::GrantListEntry object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Constraints

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a grant.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Constraints => L<Paws::KMS::GrantConstraints>

A list of key-value pairs that must be present in the encryption
context of certain subsequent operations that the grant allows.


=head2 CreationDate => Str

The date and time when the grant was created.


=head2 GranteePrincipal => Str

The identity that gets the permissions in the grant.

The C<GranteePrincipal> field in the C<ListGrants> response usually
contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in the
grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an Amazon
Web Services service, the C<GranteePrincipal> field contains the
service principal
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#principal-services),
which might represent several different grantee principals.


=head2 GrantId => Str

The unique identifier for the grant.


=head2 IssuingAccount => Str

The Amazon Web Services account under which the grant was issued.


=head2 KeyId => Str

The unique identifier for the KMS key to which the grant applies.


=head2 Name => Str

The friendly name that identifies the grant. If a name was provided in
the CreateGrant request, that name is returned. Otherwise this value is
null.


=head2 Operations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of operations permitted by the grant.


=head2 RetiringPrincipal => Str

The principal that can retire the grant.
