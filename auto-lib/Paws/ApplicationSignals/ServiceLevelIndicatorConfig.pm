=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComparisonOperator => $value, ..., SliMetricConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComparisonOperator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure specifies the information about the service and the
performance metric that a period-based SLO is to monitor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComparisonOperator => Str

The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified metric to
the threshold.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricThreshold => Num

This parameter is used only when a request-based SLO tracks the
C<Latency> metric. Specify the threshold value that the observed
C<Latency> metric values are to be compared to.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SliMetricConfig => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig>

Use this structure to specify the metric to be used for the SLO.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ApplicationSignals>
