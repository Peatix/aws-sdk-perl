=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependency

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependency object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependencyKeyAttributes => $value, ..., OperationName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependency object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependencyKeyAttributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about one dependency of this
service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DependencyKeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DependencyOperationName => Str

The name of the called operation in the dependency.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricReference>]

An array of structures that each contain information about one metric
associated with this service dependency that was discovered by
Application Signals.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OperationName => Str

The name of the operation in this service that calls the dependency.
