=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricStat

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricStat object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Metric => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricStat object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Metric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure defines the metric to be used as the service level
indicator, along with the statistics, period, and unit.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metric => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Metric>

The metric to use as the service level indicator, including the metric
name, namespace, and dimensions.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Period => Int

The granularity, in seconds, to be used for the metric. For metrics
with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60
seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that
are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be
1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are
those metrics stored by a C<PutMetricData> call that includes a
C<StorageResolution> of 1 second.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Stat => Str

The statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. It can be any
CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For more information about
statistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html).


=head2 Unit => Str

If you omit C<Unit> then all data that was collected with any unit is
returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when
the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the
operation returns only data that was collected with that unit
specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data
collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not
perform unit conversions.
