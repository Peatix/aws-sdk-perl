=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MetricReferences => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MetricReferences

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about an operation discovered by
Application Signals. An operation is a specific function performed by a
service that was discovered by Application Signals, and is often an API
that is called by an upstream dependent.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricReference>]

An array of structures that each contain information about one metric
associated with this service operation that was discovered by
Application Signals.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the operation, discovered by Application Signals.
