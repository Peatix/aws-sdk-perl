=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependencyConfig => $value, ..., TotalRequestCountMetric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependencyConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this structure to specify the information for the metric that a
period-based SLO will monitor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DependencyConfig => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig>

Identifies the dependency using the C<DependencyKeyAttributes> and
C<DependencyOperationName>.


=head2 KeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

If this SLO is related to a metric collected by Application Signals,
you must use this field to specify which service the SLO metric is
related to. To do so, you must specify at least the C<Type>, C<Name>,
and C<Environment> attributes.

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 MetricType => Str

If the SLO is to monitor either the C<LATENCY> or C<AVAILABILITY>
metric that Application Signals collects, use this field to specify
which of those metrics is used.


=head2 MonitoredRequestCountMetric => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MonitoredRequestCountMetricDataQueries>

Use this structure to define the metric that you want to use as the
"good request" or "bad request" value for a request-based SLO. This
value observed for the metric defined in C<TotalRequestCountMetric>
will be divided by the number found for C<MonitoredRequestCountMetric>
to determine the percentage of successful requests that this SLO
tracks.


=head2 OperationName => Str

If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service, use this
field to specify the name of that operation.


=head2 TotalRequestCountMetric => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricDataQuery>]

Use this structure to define the metric that you want to use as the
"total requests" number for a request-based SLO. This result will be
divided by the "good request" or "bad request" value defined in
C<MonitoredRequestCountMetric>.
