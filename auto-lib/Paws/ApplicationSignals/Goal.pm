=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::Goal

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::Goal object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttainmentGoal => $value, ..., WarningThreshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::Goal object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttainmentGoal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the attributes that determine the goal of an
SLO. This includes the time period for evaluation and the attainment
threshold.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttainmentGoal => Num

The threshold that determines if the goal is being met.

If this is a period-based SLO, the attainment goal is the percentage of
good periods that meet the threshold requirements to the total periods
within the interval. For example, an attainment goal of 99.9% means
that within your interval, you are targeting 99.9% of the periods to be
in healthy state.

If this is a request-based SLO, the attainment goal is the percentage
of requests that must be successful to meet the attainment goal.

If you omit this parameter, 99 is used to represent 99% as the
attainment goal.


=head2 Interval => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Interval>

The time period used to evaluate the SLO. It can be either a calendar
interval or rolling interval.

If you omit this parameter, a rolling interval of 7 days is used.


=head2 WarningThreshold => Num

The percentage of remaining budget over total budget that you want to
get warnings for. If you omit this parameter, the default of 50.0 is
used.
