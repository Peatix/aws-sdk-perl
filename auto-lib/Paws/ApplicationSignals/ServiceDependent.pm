=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependentKeyAttributes => $value, ..., OperationName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceDependent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependentKeyAttributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about a service dependent that was
discovered by Application Signals. A dependent is an entity that
invoked the specified service during the provided time range.
Dependents include other services, CloudWatch Synthetics canaries, and
clients that are instrumented with CloudWatch RUM app monitors.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DependentKeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=head2 DependentOperationName => Str

If the dependent invoker was a service that invoked it from an
operation, the name of that dependent operation is displayed here.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricReference>]

An array of structures that each contain information about one metric
associated with this service dependent that was discovered by
Application Signals.


=head2 OperationName => Str

If the invoked entity is an operation on an entity, the name of that
dependent operation is displayed here.



=head1 SEE ALSO
