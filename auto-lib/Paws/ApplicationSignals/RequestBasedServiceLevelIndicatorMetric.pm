=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependencyConfig => $value, ..., TotalRequestCountMetric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicatorMetric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependencyConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains the information about the metric that is used
for a request-based SLO.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DependencyConfig => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig>

Identifies the dependency using the C<DependencyKeyAttributes> and
C<DependencyOperationName>.


=head2 KeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map that contains information about the type
of object that this SLO is related to. It can include the following
fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object that this SLO is related to.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 MetricType => Str

If the SLO monitors either the C<LATENCY> or C<AVAILABILITY> metric
that Application Signals collects, this field displays which of those
metrics is used.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MonitoredRequestCountMetric => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MonitoredRequestCountMetricDataQueries>

This structure defines the metric that is used as the "good request" or
"bad request" value for a request-based SLO. This value observed for
the metric defined in C<TotalRequestCountMetric> is divided by the
number found for C<MonitoredRequestCountMetric> to determine the
percentage of successful requests that this SLO tracks.


=head2 OperationName => Str

If the SLO monitors a specific operation of the service, this field
displays that operation name.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TotalRequestCountMetric => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricDataQuery>]

This structure defines the metric that is used as the "total requests"
number for a request-based SLO. The number observed for this metric is
divided by the number of "good requests" or "bad requests" that is
observed for the metric defined in C<MonitoredRequestCountMetric>.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::ApplicationSignals>
