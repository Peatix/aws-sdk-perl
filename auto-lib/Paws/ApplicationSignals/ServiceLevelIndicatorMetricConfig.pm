=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependencyConfig => $value, ..., Statistic => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicatorMetricConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependencyConfig

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this structure to specify the information for the metric that a
period-based SLO will monitor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DependencyConfig => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig>

Identifies the dependency using the C<DependencyKeyAttributes> and
C<DependencyOperationName>.


=head2 KeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

If this SLO is related to a metric collected by Application Signals,
you must use this field to specify which service the SLO metric is
related to. To do so, you must specify at least the C<Type>, C<Name>,
and C<Environment> attributes.

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=head2 MetricDataQueries => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricDataQuery>]

If this SLO monitors a CloudWatch metric or the result of a CloudWatch
metric math expression, use this structure to specify that metric or
expression.


=head2 MetricType => Str

If the SLO is to monitor either the C<LATENCY> or C<AVAILABILITY>
metric that Application Signals collects, use this field to specify
which of those metrics is used.


=head2 OperationName => Str

If the SLO is to monitor a specific operation of the service, use this
field to specify the name of that operation.


=head2 PeriodSeconds => Int

The number of seconds to use as the period for SLO evaluation. Your
application's performance is compared to the SLI during each period.
For each period, the application is determined to have either achieved
or not achieved the necessary performance.


=head2 Statistic => Str

The statistic to use for comparison to the threshold. It can be any
CloudWatch statistic or extended statistic. For more information about
statistics, see CloudWatch statistics definitions
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html).
