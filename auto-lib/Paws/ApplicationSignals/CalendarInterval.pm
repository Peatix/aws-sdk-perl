=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::CalendarInterval

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::CalendarInterval object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Duration => $value, ..., StartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::CalendarInterval object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Duration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If the interval for this service level objective is a calendar
interval, this structure contains the interval specifications.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Duration => Int

Specifies the duration of each calendar interval. For example, if
C<Duration> is C<1> and C<DurationUnit> is C<MONTH>, each interval is
one month, aligned with the calendar.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DurationUnit => Str

Specifies the calendar interval unit.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartTime => Str

The date and time when you want the first interval to start. Be sure to
choose a time that configures the intervals the way that you want. For
example, if you want weekly intervals starting on Mondays at 6 a.m., be
sure to specify a start time that is a Monday at 6 a.m.

When used in a raw HTTP Query API, it is formatted as be epoch time in
seconds. For example: C<1698778057>

As soon as one calendar interval ends, another automatically begins.
