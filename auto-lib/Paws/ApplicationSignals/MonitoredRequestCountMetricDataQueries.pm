=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::MonitoredRequestCountMetricDataQueries

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::MonitoredRequestCountMetricDataQueries object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BadCountMetric => $value, ..., GoodCountMetric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::MonitoredRequestCountMetricDataQueries object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BadCountMetric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure defines the metric that is used as the "good request" or
"bad request" value for a request-based SLO. This value observed for
the metric defined in C<TotalRequestCountMetric> is divided by the
number found for C<MonitoredRequestCountMetric> to determine the
percentage of successful requests that this SLO tracks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BadCountMetric => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricDataQuery>]

If you want to count "bad requests" to determine the percentage of
successful requests for this request-based SLO, specify the metric to
use as "bad requests" in this structure.


=head2 GoodCountMetric => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricDataQuery>]

If you want to count "good requests" to determine the percentage of
successful requests for this request-based SLO, specify the metric to
use as "good requests" in this structure.



=head1 SEE ALSO
