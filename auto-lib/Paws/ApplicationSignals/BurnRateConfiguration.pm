=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::BurnRateConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::BurnRateConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LookBackWindowMinutes => $value, ..., LookBackWindowMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::BurnRateConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LookBackWindowMinutes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object defines the length of the look-back window used to
calculate one burn rate metric for this SLO. The burn rate measures how
fast the service is consuming the error budget, relative to the
attainment goal of the SLO. A burn rate of exactly 1 indicates that the
SLO goal will be met exactly.

For example, if you specify 60 as the number of minutes in the
look-back window, the burn rate is calculated as the following:

I<burn rate = error rate over the look-back window / (100% - attainment
goal percentage)>

For more information about burn rates, see Calculate burn rates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives.html#CloudWatch-ServiceLevelObjectives-burn).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LookBackWindowMinutes => Int
