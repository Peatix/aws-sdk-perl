=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::Service

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::Service object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeMaps => $value, ..., MetricReferences => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::Service object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeMaps

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure contains information about one of your services that was
discovered by Application Signals.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttributeMaps => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::AttributeMap>]

This structure contains one or more string-to-string maps that help
identify this service. It can include I<platform attributes>,
I<application attributes>, and I<telemetry attributes>.

Platform attributes contain information the service's platform.

=over

=item *

C<PlatformType> defines the hosted-in platform.

=item *

C<EKS.Cluster> is the name of the Amazon EKS cluster.

=item *

C<K8s.Cluster> is the name of the self-hosted Kubernetes cluster.

=item *

C<K8s.Namespace> is the name of the Kubernetes namespace in either
Amazon EKS or Kubernetes clusters.

=item *

C<K8s.Workload> is the name of the Kubernetes workload in either Amazon
EKS or Kubernetes clusters.

=item *

C<K8s.Node> is the name of the Kubernetes node in either Amazon EKS or
Kubernetes clusters.

=item *

C<K8s.Pod> is the name of the Kubernetes pod in either Amazon EKS or
Kubernetes clusters.

=item *

C<EC2.AutoScalingGroup> is the name of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
group.

=item *

C<EC2.InstanceId> is the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance.

=item *

C<Host> is the name of the host, for all platform types.

=back

Application attributes contain information about the application.

=over

=item *

C<AWS.Application> is the application's name in Amazon Web Services
Service Catalog AppRegistry.

=item *

C<AWS.Application.ARN> is the application's ARN in Amazon Web Services
Service Catalog AppRegistry.

=back

Telemetry attributes contain telemetry information.

=over

=item *

C<Telemetry.SDK> is the fingerprint of the OpenTelemetry SDK version
for instrumented services.

=item *

C<Telemetry.Agent> is the fingerprint of the agent used to collect and
send telemetry data.

=item *

C<Telemetry.Source> Specifies the point of application where the
telemetry was collected or specifies what was used for the source of
telemetry data.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 LogGroupReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>]

An array of string-to-string maps that each contain information about
one log group associated with this service. Each string-to-string map
includes the following fields:

=over

=item *

C<"Type": "AWS::Resource">

=item *

C<"ResourceType": "AWS::Logs::LogGroup">

=item *

C<"Identifier": "I<name-of-log-group>">

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricReferences => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::MetricReference>]

An array of structures that each contain information about one metric
associated with this service.
