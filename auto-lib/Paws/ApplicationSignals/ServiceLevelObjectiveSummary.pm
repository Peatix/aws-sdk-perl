=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjectiveSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjectiveSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., OperationName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjectiveSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains information about one service level objective
(SLO) created in Application Signals.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The ARN of this service level objective.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The date and time that this service level objective was created. It is
expressed as the number of milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.


=head2 DependencyConfig => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig>

Identifies the dependency using the C<DependencyKeyAttributes> and
C<DependencyOperationName>.


=head2 EvaluationType => Str

Displays whether this is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO.


=head2 KeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this service level objective is
for.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 MetricSourceType => Str

Displays the SLI metric source type for this SLO. Supported types are:

=over

=item *

Service operation

=item *

Service dependency

=item *

CloudWatch metric

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the service level objective.


=head2 OperationName => Str

If this service level objective is specific to a single operation, this
field displays the name of that operation.
