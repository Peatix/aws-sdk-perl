=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjective

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjective object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., Sli => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelObjective object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure containing information about one service level objective
(SLO) that has been created in Application Signals. Creating SLOs can
help you ensure your services are performing to the level that you
expect. SLOs help you set and track a specific target level for the
reliability and availability of your applications and services. Each
SLO uses a service level indicator (SLI), which is a key performance
metric, to calculate how much underperformance can be tolerated before
the goal that you set for the SLO is not achieved.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The ARN of this SLO.


=head2 BurnRateConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::BurnRateConfiguration>]

Each object in this array defines the length of the look-back window
used to calculate one burn rate metric for this SLO. The burn rate
measures how fast the service is consuming the error budget, relative
to the attainment goal of the SLO.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedTime => Str

The date and time that this SLO was created. When used in a raw HTTP
Query API, it is formatted as C<yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss>. For example,
C<2019-07-01T23:59:59>.


=head2 Description => Str

The description that you created for this SLO.


=head2 EvaluationType => Str

Displays whether this is a period-based SLO or a request-based SLO.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Goal => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Goal>




=head2 B<REQUIRED> LastUpdatedTime => Str

The time that this SLO was most recently updated. When used in a raw
HTTP Query API, it is formatted as C<yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss>. For
example, C<2019-07-01T23:59:59>.


=head2 MetricSourceType => Str

Displays the SLI metric source type for this SLO. Supported types are:

=over

=item *

Service operation

=item *

Service dependency

=item *

CloudWatch metric

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of this SLO.


=head2 RequestBasedSli => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::RequestBasedServiceLevelIndicator>

A structure containing information about the performance metric that
this SLO monitors, if this is a request-based SLO.


=head2 Sli => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::ServiceLevelIndicator>

A structure containing information about the performance metric that
this SLO monitors, if this is a period-based SLO.
