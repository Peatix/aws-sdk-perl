=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DependencyKeyAttributes => $value, ..., DependencyOperationName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ApplicationSignals::DependencyConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DependencyKeyAttributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Identifies the dependency using the C<DependencyKeyAttributes> and
C<DependencyOperationName>.

When creating a service dependency SLO, you must specify the
C<KeyAttributes> of the service, and the C<DependencyConfig> for the
dependency. You can specify the C<OperationName> of the service, from
which it calls the dependency. Alternatively, you can exclude
C<OperationName> and the SLO will monitor all of the service's
operations that call the dependency.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DependencyKeyAttributes => L<Paws::ApplicationSignals::Attributes>

This is a string-to-string map. It can include the following fields.

=over

=item *

C<Type> designates the type of object this is.

=item *

C<ResourceType> specifies the type of the resource. This field is used
only when the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Name> specifies the name of the object. This is used only if the
value of the C<Type> field is C<Service>, C<RemoteService>, or
C<AWS::Service>.

=item *

C<Identifier> identifies the resource objects of this resource. This is
used only if the value of the C<Type> field is C<Resource> or
C<AWS::Resource>.

=item *

C<Environment> specifies the location where this object is hosted, or
what it belongs to.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DependencyOperationName => Str

The name of the called operation in the dependency.
