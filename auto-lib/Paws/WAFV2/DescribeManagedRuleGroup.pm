Paws::WAFV2::DescribeManagedRuleGroup - Arguments for method DescribeManagedRuleGroup on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeManagedRuleGroup on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeManagedRuleGroup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeManagedRuleGroup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse = $wafv2->DescribeManagedRuleGroup(
      Name        => 'MyEntityName',
      Scope       => 'CLOUDFRONT',
      VendorName  => 'MyVendorName',
      VersionName => 'MyVersionKeyString',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $AvailableLabels = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->AvailableLabels;
    my $Capacity        = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->Capacity;
    my $ConsumedLabels  = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->ConsumedLabels;
    my $LabelNamespace  = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->LabelNamespace;
    my $Rules           = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->Rules;
    my $SnsTopicArn     = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->SnsTopicArn;
    my $VersionName     = $DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse->VersionName;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFV2::DescribeManagedRuleGroupResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

C<--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1>.
