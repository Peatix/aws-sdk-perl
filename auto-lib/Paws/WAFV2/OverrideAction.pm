=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::OverrideAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::OverrideAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Count => $value, ..., None => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::OverrideAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Count

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule
group evaluation. Set the override action to none to leave the result
of the rule group alone. Set it to count to override the result to
count only.

You can only use this for rule statements that reference a rule group,
like C<RuleGroupReferenceStatement> and C<ManagedRuleGroupStatement>.

This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in
the rule group are evaluated. If you want the rules in the rule group
to only count matches, do not use this and instead use the rule action
override option, with C<Count> action, in your rule group reference
statement settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Count => L<Paws::WAFV2::CountAction>

Override the rule group evaluation result to count only.

This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in
the rule group are evaluated. If you want the rules in the rule group
to only count matches, do not use this and instead use the rule action
override option, with C<Count> action, in your rule group reference
statement settings.


=head2 None => L<Paws::WAFV2::NoneAction>

Don't override the rule group evaluation result. This is the most
common setting.
