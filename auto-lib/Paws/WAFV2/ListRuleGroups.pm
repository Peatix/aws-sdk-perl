=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ListRuleGroups - Arguments for method ListRuleGroups on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListRuleGroups on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListRuleGroups.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListRuleGroups.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $ListRuleGroupsResponse = $wafv2->ListRuleGroups(
      Scope      => 'CLOUDFRONT',
      Limit      => 1,                 # OPTIONAL
      NextMarker => 'MyNextMarker',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextMarker = $ListRuleGroupsResponse->NextMarker;
    my $RuleGroups = $ListRuleGroupsResponse->RuleGroups;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFV2::ListRuleGroupsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/wafv2/ListRuleGroups>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Limit => Int

The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return for this
request. If more objects are available, in the response, WAF provides a
C<NextMarker> value that you can use in a subsequent call to get the
next batch of objects.



=head2 NextMarker => Str

When you request a list of objects with a C<Limit> setting, if the
number of objects that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
limit, WAF returns a C<NextMarker> value in the response. To retrieve
the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
your next request.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Scope => Str

Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon
CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use C<CLOUDFRONT>.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:

=over

=item *

CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope:
C<--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1>.

=item *

API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

=back


Valid values are: C<"CLOUDFRONT">, C<"REGIONAL">
