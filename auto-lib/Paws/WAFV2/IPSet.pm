=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::IPSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::IPSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Addresses => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::IPSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Addresses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains zero or more IP addresses or blocks of IP addresses specified
in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all
IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges except for /0. For information about CIDR
notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

WAF assigns an ARN to each C<IPSet> that you create. To use an IP set
in a rule, you provide the ARN to the Rule statement
IPSetReferenceStatement.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Addresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses
or blocks of IP addresses that you want WAF to inspect for in incoming
requests. All addresses must be specified using Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges
except for C</0>.

Example address strings:

=over

=item *

For requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
C<192.0.2.44/32>.

=item *

For requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to
192.0.2.255, specify C<192.0.2.0/24>.

=item *

For requests that originated from the IP address
1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128>.

=item *

For requests that originated from IP addresses
1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64>.

Example JSON C<Addresses> specifications:

=over

=item *

Empty array: C<"Addresses": []>

=item *

Array with one address: C<"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]>

=item *

Array with three addresses: C<"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32",
"192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]>

=item *

INVALID specification: C<"Addresses": [""]> INVALID

=head2 B<REQUIRED> ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the IP set that helps with identification.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses
to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update
and delete.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IPAddressVersion => Str

The version of the IP addresses, either C<IPV4> or C<IPV6>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an C<IPSet> after
you create it.
