=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitForwardedIP

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitForwardedIP object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => {  => $value, ...,  => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitForwardedIP object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the first IP address in an HTTP header as an aggregate key
for a rate-based rule. Each distinct forwarded IP address contributes
to the aggregation instance.

This setting is used only in the C<RateBasedStatementCustomKey>
specification of a rate-based rule statement. When you specify an IP or
forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least
one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the forwarded IP
address by specifying C<FORWARDED_IP> in your rate-based statement's
C<AggregateKeyType>.

This data type supports using the forwarded IP address in the web
request aggregation for a rate-based rule, in
C<RateBasedStatementCustomKey>. The JSON specification for using the
forwarded IP address doesn't explicitly use this data type.

JSON specification: C<"ForwardedIP": {}>

When you use this specification, you must also configure the forwarded
IP address in the rate-based statement's C<ForwardedIPConfig>.
