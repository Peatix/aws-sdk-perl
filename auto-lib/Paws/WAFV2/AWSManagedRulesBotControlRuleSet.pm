=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableMachineLearning => $value, ..., InspectionLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableMachineLearning

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details for your use of the Bot Control managed rule group,
C<AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet>. This configuration is used in
C<ManagedRuleGroupConfig>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnableMachineLearning => Bool

Applies only to the targeted inspection level.

Determines whether to use machine learning (ML) to analyze your web
traffic for bot-related activity. Machine learning is required for the
Bot Control rules C<TGT_ML_CoordinatedActivityLow> and
C<TGT_ML_CoordinatedActivityMedium>, which inspect for anomalous
behavior that might indicate distributed, coordinated bot activity.

For more information about this choice, see the listing for these rules
in the table at Bot Control rules listing
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html#aws-managed-rule-groups-bot-rules)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

Default: C<TRUE>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InspectionLevel => Str

The inspection level to use for the Bot Control rule group. The common
level is the least expensive. The targeted level includes all common
level rules and adds rules with more advanced inspection criteria. For
details, see WAF Bot Control rule group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.
