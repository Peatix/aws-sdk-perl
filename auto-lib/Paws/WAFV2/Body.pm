=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::Body

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::Body object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OversizeHandling => $value, ..., OversizeHandling => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::Body object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OversizeHandling

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inspect the body of the web request. The body immediately follows the
request headers.

This is used to indicate the web request component to inspect, in the
FieldToMatch specification.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 OversizeHandling => Str

What WAF should do if the body is larger than WAF can inspect.

WAF does not support inspecting the entire contents of the web request
body if the body exceeds the limit for the resource type. When a web
request body is larger than the limit, the underlying host service only
forwards the contents that are within the limit to WAF for inspection.

=over

=item *

For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB
(8,192 bytes).

=item *

For CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner, and Verified
Access, the default limit is 16 KB (16,384 bytes), and you can increase
the limit for each resource type in the web ACL C<AssociationConfig>,
for additional processing fees.

=item *

For Amplify, use the CloudFront limit.

=back

The options for oversize handling are the following:

=over

=item *

C<CONTINUE> - Inspect the available body contents normally, according
to the rule inspection criteria.

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF
applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.

=back

You can combine the C<MATCH> or C<NO_MATCH> settings for oversize
handling with your rule and web ACL action settings, so that you block
any request whose body is over the limit.

Default: C<CONTINUE>
