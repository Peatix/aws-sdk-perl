=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::VisibilityConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::VisibilityConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CloudWatchMetricsEnabled => $value, ..., SampledRequestsEnabled => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::VisibilityConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CloudWatchMetricsEnabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample
collection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CloudWatchMetricsEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether the associated resource sends metrics to Amazon
CloudWatch. For the list of available metrics, see WAF Metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html#waf-metrics)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

For web ACLs, the metrics are for web requests that have the web ACL
default action applied. WAF applies the default action to web requests
that pass the inspection of all rules in the web ACL without being
either allowed or blocked. For more information, see The web ACL
default action
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-default-action.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricName => Str

A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric dimension. The name can contain
only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _ (underscore). The
name can be from one to 128 characters long. It can't contain
whitespace or metric names that are reserved for WAF, for example
C<All> and C<Default_Action>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SampledRequestsEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether WAF should store a sampling of the web requests that
match the rules. You can view the sampled requests through the WAF
console.

If you configure data protection for the web ACL, the protection
applies to the web ACL's sampled web request data.

Request sampling doesn't provide a field redaction option, and any
field redaction that you specify in your logging configuration doesn't
affect sampling. You can only exclude fields from request sampling by
disabling sampling in the web ACL visibility configuration or by
configuring data protection for the web ACL.
