=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RuleActionOverride

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RuleActionOverride object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActionToUse => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RuleActionOverride object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActionToUse

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Action setting to use in the place of a rule action that is configured
inside the rule group. You specify one override for each rule whose
action you want to change.

Take care to verify the rule names in your overrides. If you provide a
rule name that doesn't match the name of any rule in the rule group,
WAF doesn't return an error and doesn't apply the override setting.

You can use overrides for testing, for example you can override all of
rule actions to C<Count> and then monitor the resulting count metrics
to understand how the rule group would handle your web traffic. You can
also permanently override some or all actions, to modify how the rule
group manages your web traffic.
