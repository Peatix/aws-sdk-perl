=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionBodyContains object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailureStrings => $value, ..., SuccessStrings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionBodyContains object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailureStrings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configures inspection of the response body. WAF can inspect the first
65,536 bytes (64 KB) of the response body. This is part of the
C<ResponseInspection> configuration for C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet>
and C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>.

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon
CloudFront distributions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FailureStrings => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Strings in the body of the response that indicate a failed login or
account creation attempt. To be counted as a failure, the string can be
anywhere in the body and must be an exact match, including case. Each
string must be unique among the success and failure strings.

JSON example: C<"FailureStrings": [ "Request failed" ]>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SuccessStrings => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Strings in the body of the response that indicate a successful login or
account creation attempt. To be counted as a success, the string can be
anywhere in the body and must be an exact match, including case. Each
string must be unique among the success and failure strings.

JSON examples: C<"SuccessStrings": [ "Login successful" ]> and
C<"SuccessStrings": [ "Account creation successful", "Welcome to our
site!" ]>
