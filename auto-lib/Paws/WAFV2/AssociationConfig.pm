=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::AssociationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RequestBody => $value, ..., RequestBody => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::AssociationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RequestBody

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies custom configurations for the associations between the web
ACL and protected resources.

Use this to customize the maximum size of the request body that your
protected resources forward to WAF for inspection. You can customize
this setting for CloudFront, API Gateway, Amazon Cognito, App Runner,
or Verified Access resources. The default setting is 16 KB (16,384
bytes).

You are charged additional fees when your protected resources forward
body sizes that are larger than the default. For more information, see
WAF Pricing (http://aws.amazon.com/waf/pricing/).

For Application Load Balancer and AppSync, the limit is fixed at 8 KB
(8,192 bytes).
