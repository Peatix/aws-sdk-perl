=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RateBasedStatementManagedKeysIPSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RateBasedStatementManagedKeysIPSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Addresses => $value, ..., IPAddressVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RateBasedStatementManagedKeysIPSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Addresses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The set of IP addresses that are currently blocked for a
RateBasedStatement. This is only available for rate-based rules that
aggregate on just the IP address, with the C<AggregateKeyType> set to
C<IP> or C<FORWARDED_IP>.

A rate-based rule applies its rule action to requests from IP addresses
that are in the rule's managed keys list and that match the rule's
scope-down statement. When a rule has no scope-down statement, it
applies the action to all requests from the IP addresses that are in
the list. The rule applies its rule action to rate limit the matching
requests. The action is usually Block but it can be any valid rule
action except for Allow.

The maximum number of IP addresses that can be rate limited by a single
rate-based rule instance is 10,000. If more than 10,000 addresses
exceed the rate limit, WAF limits those with the highest rates.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Addresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The IP addresses that are currently blocked.


=head2 IPAddressVersion => Str

The version of the IP addresses, either C<IPV4> or C<IPV6>.
