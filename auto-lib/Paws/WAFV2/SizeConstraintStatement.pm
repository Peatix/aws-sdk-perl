=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::SizeConstraintStatement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::SizeConstraintStatement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComparisonOperator => $value, ..., TextTransformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::SizeConstraintStatement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComparisonOperator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule statement that compares a number of bytes against the size of a
request component, using a comparison operator, such as greater than
(E<gt>) or less than (E<lt>). For example, you can use a size
constraint statement to look for query strings that are longer than 100
bytes.

If you configure WAF to inspect the request body, WAF inspects only the
number of bytes in the body up to the limit for the web ACL and
protected resource type. If you know that the request body for your web
requests should never exceed the inspection limit, you can use a size
constraint statement to block requests that have a larger request body
size. For more information about the inspection limits, see C<Body> and
C<JsonBody> settings for the C<FieldToMatch> data type.

If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request to filter on,
the slash (/) in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI
C</logo.jpg> is nine characters long.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComparisonOperator => Str

The operator to use to compare the request part to the size setting.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FieldToMatch => L<Paws::WAFV2::FieldToMatch>

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Size => Int

The size, in byte, to compare to the request part, after any
transformations.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TextTransformations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::TextTransformation>]

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that
attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text
transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the
C<FieldToMatch> request component before inspecting it, and they're
used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components
before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or
more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the
specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then
uses the transformed component contents.
