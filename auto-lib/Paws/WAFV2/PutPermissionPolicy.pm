=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::PutPermissionPolicy - Arguments for method PutPermissionPolicy on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutPermissionPolicy on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutPermissionPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutPermissionPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $PutPermissionPolicyResponse = $wafv2->PutPermissionPolicy(
      Policy      => 'MyPolicyString',
      ResourceArn => 'MyResourceArn',

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
