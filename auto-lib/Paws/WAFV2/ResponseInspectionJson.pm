=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionJson

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionJson object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailureValues => $value, ..., SuccessValues => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionJson object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailureValues

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configures inspection of the response JSON. WAF can inspect the first
65,536 bytes (64 KB) of the response JSON. This is part of the
C<ResponseInspection> configuration for C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet>
and C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>.

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon
CloudFront distributions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FailureValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Values for the specified identifier in the response JSON that indicate
a failed login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a failure,
the value must be an exact match, including case. Each value must be
unique among the success and failure values.

JSON example: C<"FailureValues": [ "False", "Failed" ]>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Identifier => Str

The identifier for the value to match against in the JSON. The
identifier must be an exact match, including case.

JSON examples: C<"Identifier": [ "/login/success" ]> and
C<"Identifier": [ "/sign-up/success" ]>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SuccessValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Values for the specified identifier in the response JSON that indicate
a successful login or account creation attempt. To be counted as a
success, the value must be an exact match, including case. Each value
must be unique among the success and failure values.

JSON example: C<"SuccessValues": [ "True", "Succeeded" ]>
