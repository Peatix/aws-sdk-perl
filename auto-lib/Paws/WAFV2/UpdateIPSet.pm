=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::UpdateIPSet - Arguments for method UpdateIPSet on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateIPSet on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateIPSet.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateIPSet.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $UpdateIPSetResponse = $wafv2->UpdateIPSet(
      Addresses => [
        'MyIPAddress', ...    # min: 1, max: 50
      ],
      Id          => 'MyEntityId',
      LockToken   => 'MyLockToken',
      Name        => 'MyEntityName',
      Scope       => 'CLOUDFRONT',
      Description => 'MyEntityDescription',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $NextLockToken = $UpdateIPSetResponse->NextLockToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFV2::UpdateIPSetResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/wafv2/UpdateIPSet>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Addresses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP addresses
or blocks of IP addresses that you want WAF to inspect for in incoming
requests. All addresses must be specified using Classless Inter-Domain
Routing (CIDR) notation. WAF supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR ranges
except for C</0>.

Example address strings:

=over

=item *

For requests that originated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify
C<192.0.2.44/32>.

=item *

For requests that originated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to
192.0.2.255, specify C<192.0.2.0/24>.

=item *

For requests that originated from the IP address
1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128>.

=item *

For requests that originated from IP addresses
1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 to
1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, specify
C<1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64>.

=back

For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry
Classless Inter-Domain Routing
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing).

Example JSON C<Addresses> specifications:

=over

=item *

Empty array: C<"Addresses": []>

=item *

Array with one address: C<"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]>

=item *

Array with three addresses: C<"Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32",
"192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]>

=item *

INVALID specification: C<"Addresses": [""]> INVALID

=head2 Description => Str

A description of the IP set that helps with identification.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Id => Str

A unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the responses
to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update
and delete.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your C<get>
and C<list> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like C<update> and C<delete>. WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another C<get>, and use the new token returned by that operation.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an C<IPSet> after
you create it.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Scope => Str

Specifies whether this is for a global resource type, such as a Amazon
CloudFront distribution. For an Amplify application, use C<CLOUDFRONT>.

To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N.
Virginia) as follows:

=over

=item *

CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope:
C<--scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1>.

=item *

API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

=back


Valid values are: C<"CLOUDFRONT">, C<"REGIONAL">
