=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::JA4Fingerprint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::JA4Fingerprint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FallbackBehavior => $value, ..., FallbackBehavior => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::JA4Fingerprint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FallbackBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Available for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions and Application
Load Balancers. Match against the request's JA4 fingerprint. The JA4
fingerprint is a 36-character hash derived from the TLS Client Hello of
an incoming request. This fingerprint serves as a unique identifier for
the client's TLS configuration. WAF calculates and logs this
fingerprint for each request that has enough TLS Client Hello
information for the calculation. Almost all web requests include this
information.

You can use this choice only with a string match C<ByteMatchStatement>
with the C<PositionalConstraint> set to C<EXACTLY>.

You can obtain the JA4 fingerprint for client requests from the web ACL
logs. If WAF is able to calculate the fingerprint, it includes it in
the logs. For information about the logging fields, see Log fields
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

Provide the JA4 fingerprint string from the logs in your string match
statement specification, to match with any future requests that have
the same TLS configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FallbackBehavior => Str

The match status to assign to the web request if the request doesn't
have a JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

=over

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF
applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
