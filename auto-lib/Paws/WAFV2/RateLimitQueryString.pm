=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitQueryString

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitQueryString object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TextTransformations => $value, ..., TextTransformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitQueryString object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TextTransformations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the request's query string as an aggregate key for a
rate-based rule. Each distinct string contributes to the aggregation
instance. If you use just the query string as your custom key, then
each string fully defines an aggregation instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TextTransformations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::TextTransformation>]

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that
attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text
transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the
C<FieldToMatch> request component before inspecting it, and they're
used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components
before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or
more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the
specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then
uses the transformed component contents.
