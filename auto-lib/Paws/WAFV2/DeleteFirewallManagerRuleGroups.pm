=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups - Arguments for method DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroupsResponse =
      $wafv2->DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroups(
      WebACLArn       => 'MyResourceArn',
      WebACLLockToken => 'MyLockToken',

      );

    # Results:
    my $NextWebACLLockToken =
      $DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroupsResponse->NextWebACLLockToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFV2::DeleteFirewallManagerRuleGroupsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> WebACLArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> WebACLLockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your C<get>
and C<list> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like C<update> and C<delete>. WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another C<get>, and use the new token returned by that operation.
