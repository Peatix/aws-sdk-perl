Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationPath => $value, ..., ResponseInspection => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationPath

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details for your use of the account creation fraud prevention managed
rule group, C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>. This configuration is used
in C<ManagedRuleGroupConfig>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationPath => Str

The path of the account creation endpoint for your application. This is
the page on your website that accepts the completed registration form
for a new user. This page must accept C<POST> requests.

For example, for the URL C<https://example.com/web/newaccount>, you
would provide the path C</web/newaccount>. Account creation page paths
that start with the path that you provide are considered a match. For
example C</web/newaccount> matches the account creation paths
C</web/newaccount>, C</web/newaccount/>, C</web/newaccountPage>, and
C</web/newaccount/thisPage>, but doesn't match the path
C</home/web/newaccount> or C</website/newaccount>.


=head2 EnableRegexInPath => Bool

Allow the use of regular expressions in the registration page path and
the account creation path.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RegistrationPagePath => Str

The path of the account registration endpoint for your application.
This is the page on your website that presents the registration form to
new users.

This page must accept C<GET> text/html requests.

For example, for the URL C<https://example.com/web/registration>, you
would provide the path C</web/registration>. Registration page paths
that start with the path that you provide are considered a match. For
example C</web/registration> matches the registration paths
C</web/registration>, C</web/registration/>, C</web/registrationPage>,
and C</web/registration/thisPage>, but doesn't match the path
C</home/web/registration> or C</website/registration>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RequestInspection => L<Paws::WAFV2::RequestInspectionACFP>

The criteria for inspecting account creation requests, used by the ACFP
rule group to validate and track account creation attempts.


=head2 ResponseInspection => L<Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspection>

The criteria for inspecting responses to account creation requests,
used by the ACFP rule group to track account creation success rates.

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon
CloudFront distributions.

The ACFP rule group evaluates the responses that your protected
resources send back to client account creation attempts, keeping count
of successful and failed attempts from each IP address and client
session. Using this information, the rule group labels and mitigates
requests from client sessions and IP addresses that have had too many
successful account creation attempts in a short amount of time.
