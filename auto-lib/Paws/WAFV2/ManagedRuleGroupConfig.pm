=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleGroupConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleGroupConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet => $value, ..., UsernameField => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleGroupConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additional information that's used by a managed rule group. Many
managed rule groups don't require this.

The rule groups used for intelligent threat mitigation require
additional configuration:

=over

=item *

Use the C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet> configuration object to configure
the account creation fraud prevention managed rule group. The
configuration includes the registration and sign-up pages of your
application and the locations in the account creation request payload
of data, such as the user email and phone number fields.

=item *

Use the C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet> configuration object to configure
the account takeover prevention managed rule group. The configuration
includes the sign-in page of your application and the locations in the
login request payload of data such as the username and password.

=item *

Use the C<AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet> configuration object to
configure the protection level that you want the Bot Control rule group
to use.

=back

For example specifications, see the examples section of CreateWebACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet => L<Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>

Additional configuration for using the account creation fraud
prevention (ACFP) managed rule group, C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>.
Use this to provide account creation request information to the rule
group. For web ACLs that protect CloudFront distributions, use this to
also provide the information about how your distribution responds to
account creation requests.

For information about using the ACFP managed rule group, see WAF Fraud
Control account creation fraud prevention (ACFP) rule group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-acfp.html)
and WAF Fraud Control account creation fraud prevention (ACFP)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-acfp.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.


=head2 AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet => L<Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet>

Additional configuration for using the account takeover prevention
(ATP) managed rule group, C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet>. Use this to
provide login request information to the rule group. For web ACLs that
protect CloudFront distributions, use this to also provide the
information about how your distribution responds to login requests.

This configuration replaces the individual configuration fields in
C<ManagedRuleGroupConfig> and provides additional feature
configuration.

For information about using the ATP managed rule group, see WAF Fraud
Control account takeover prevention (ATP) rule group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-atp.html)

=head2 AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet => L<Paws::WAFV2::AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet>

Additional configuration for using the Bot Control managed rule group.
Use this to specify the inspection level that you want to use. For
information about using the Bot Control managed rule group, see WAF Bot
Control rule group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-bot.html)

inspection configuration for C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet> or
C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>.

Instead of this setting, provide your configuration under the request
inspection configuration for C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet> or
C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet>.
