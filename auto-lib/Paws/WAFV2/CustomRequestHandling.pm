=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::CustomRequestHandling

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::CustomRequestHandling object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InsertHeaders => $value, ..., InsertHeaders => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::CustomRequestHandling object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InsertHeaders

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Custom request handling behavior that inserts custom headers into a web
request. You can add custom request handling for WAF to use when the
rule action doesn't block the request. For example, C<CaptchaAction>
for requests with valid t okens, and C<AllowAction>.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see
Customizing web requests and responses in WAF
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-custom-request-response.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InsertHeaders => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::CustomHTTPHeader>]

not allowed.

For information about the limits on count and size for custom request
and response settings, see WAF quotas

the I<WAF Developer Guide>.
