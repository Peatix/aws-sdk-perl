=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitJA4Fingerprint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitJA4Fingerprint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FallbackBehavior => $value, ..., FallbackBehavior => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RateLimitJA4Fingerprint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FallbackBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use the request's JA4 fingerprint derived from the TLS Client Hello of
an incoming request as an aggregate key. If you use a single JA4
fingerprint as your custom key, then each value fully defines an
aggregation instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FallbackBehavior => Str

The match status to assign to the web request if there is insufficient
TSL Client Hello information to compute the JA4 fingerprint.

You can specify the following fallback behaviors:

=over

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF
applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
