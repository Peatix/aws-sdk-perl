=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the IP address in the web request as an aggregate key for a
rate-based rule. Each distinct IP address contributes to the
aggregation instance.

This setting is used only in the C<RateBasedStatementCustomKey>
specification of a rate-based rule statement. To use this in the custom
key settings, you must specify at least one other key to use, along
with the IP address. To aggregate on only the IP address, in your
rate-based statement's C<AggregateKeyType>, specify C<IP>.

JSON specification: C<"RateLimitIP": {}>
