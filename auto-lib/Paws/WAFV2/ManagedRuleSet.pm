  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., RecommendedVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSet object:

  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of rules that is managed by Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web
Services Marketplace sellers to provide versioned managed rule groups
for customers of WAF.

This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors
are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your
customers. The APIs are C<ListManagedRuleSets>, C<GetManagedRuleSet>,
C<PutManagedRuleSetVersions>, and
C<UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate>.

A description of the set that helps with identification.

The label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are offered

=item *

The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is
the following:

C<awswaf:managed:E<lt>vendorE<gt>:E<lt>rule group nameE<gt>>:

=item *

When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully
qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of
the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is
defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

C<E<lt>label namespaceE<gt>:E<lt>label from ruleE<gt>>
