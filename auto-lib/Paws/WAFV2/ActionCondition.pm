  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Action => $value  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single action condition for a Condition in a logging filter.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => Str

The action setting that a log record must contain in order to meet the
condition. This is the action that WAF applied to the web request.

For rule groups, this is either the configured rule action setting, or
if you've applied a rule action override to the rule, it's the override
action. The value C<EXCLUDED_AS_COUNT> matches on excluded rules and
also on rules that have a rule action override of Count.
