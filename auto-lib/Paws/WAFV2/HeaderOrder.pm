=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::HeaderOrder

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::HeaderOrder object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { OversizeHandling => $value, ..., OversizeHandling => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::HeaderOrder object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->OversizeHandling

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inspect a string containing the list of the request's header names,
ordered as they appear in the web request that WAF receives for
inspection. WAF generates the string and then uses that as the field to
match component in its inspection. WAF separates the header names in
the string using colons and no added spaces, for example
C<host:user-agent:accept:authorization:referer>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OversizeHandling => Str

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or
larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire
contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200
total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200
headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

=over

=item *

C<CONTINUE> - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the
rule inspection criteria.

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF
applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
