=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::SampledHTTPRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::SampledHTTPRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Weight => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::SampledHTTPRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a single sampled web request. The response from
GetSampledRequests includes a C<SampledHTTPRequests> complex type that
appears as C<SampledRequests> in the response syntax.
C<SampledHTTPRequests> contains an array of C<SampledHTTPRequest>
objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Action => Str

The action that WAF applied to the request.


=head2 CaptchaResponse => L<Paws::WAFV2::CaptchaResponse>

The C<CAPTCHA> response for the request.


=head2 ChallengeResponse => L<Paws::WAFV2::ChallengeResponse>

The C<Challenge> response for the request.


=head2 Labels => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::Label>]

Labels applied to the web request by matching rules. WAF applies fully
qualified labels to matching web requests. A fully qualified label is
the concatenation of a label namespace and a rule label. The rule's
rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

For example,
C<awswaf:111122223333:myRuleGroup:testRules:testNS1:testNS2:labelNameA>
or C<awswaf:managed:aws:managed-rule-set:header:encoding:utf8>.


=head2 OverriddenAction => Str

Used only for rule group rules that have a rule action override in
place in the web ACL. This is the action that the rule group rule is
configured for, and not the action that was applied to the request. The
action that WAF applied is the C<Action> value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Request => L<Paws::WAFV2::HTTPRequest>

A complex type that contains detailed information about the request.


=head2 RequestHeadersInserted => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::HTTPHeader>]

Custom request headers inserted by WAF into the request, according to
the custom request configuration for the matching rule action.


=head2 ResponseCodeSent => Int

The response code that was sent for the request.


=head2 RuleNameWithinRuleGroup => Str

The name of the C<Rule> that the request matched. For managed rule
groups, the format for this name is C<E<lt>vendor
nameE<gt>#E<lt>managed rule group nameE<gt>#E<lt>rule nameE<gt>>. For
your own rule groups, the format for this name is C<E<lt>rule group
nameE<gt>#E<lt>rule nameE<gt>>. If the rule is not in a rule group,
this field is absent.


=head2 Timestamp => Str

The time at which WAF received the request from your Amazon Web
Services resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Weight => Int

A value that indicates how one result in the response relates
proportionally to other results in the response. For example, a result
that has a weight of C<2> represents roughly twice as many web requests
as a result that has a weight of C<1>.
