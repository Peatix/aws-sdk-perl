=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

High-level information for a managed rule set.

This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors
are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your
customers. The APIs are C<ListManagedRuleSets>, C<GetManagedRuleSet>,
C<PutManagedRuleSetVersions>, and
C<UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the set that helps with identification.


=head2 Id => Str

A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned in the
responses to commands like C<list>. You provide it to operations like
C<get> and C<update>.


=head2 LabelNamespace => Str

The label namespace prefix for the managed rule groups that are offered
to customers from this managed rule set. All labels that are added by
rules in the managed rule group have this prefix.

=over

=item *

The syntax for the label namespace prefix for a managed rule group is
the following:

C<awswaf:managed:E<lt>vendorE<gt>:E<lt>rule group nameE<gt>>:

=item *

When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully
qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up of
the label namespace from the rule group or web ACL where the rule is
defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:

C<E<lt>label namespaceE<gt>:E<lt>label from ruleE<gt>>

=back



=head2 LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your C<get>
and C<list> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like C<update> and C<delete>. WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another C<get>, and use the new token returned by that operation.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule set
ID, to identify the rule set.

This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
your customers can access and use.
