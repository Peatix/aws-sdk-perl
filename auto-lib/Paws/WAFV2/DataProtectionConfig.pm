  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataProtections => $value, ..., DataProtections => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies data protection to apply to the web request data for the web
ACL. This is a web ACL level data protection option.

The data protection that you configure for the web ACL alters the data
that's available for any other data collection activity, including your
WAF logging destinations, web ACL request sampling, and Amazon Security
Lake data collection and management. Your other option for data
protection is in the logging configuration, which only affects logging.

This is part of the data protection configuration for a web ACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES
