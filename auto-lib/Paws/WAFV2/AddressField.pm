=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::AddressField

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::AddressField object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifier => $value, ..., Identifier => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::AddressField object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=item *

For JSON payloads, specify the field identifiers in JSON pointer
syntax. For information about the JSON Pointer syntax, see the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) documentation JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) Pointer (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

For example, for the JSON payload C<{ "form": { "primaryaddressline1":
"THE_ADDRESS1", "primaryaddressline2": "THE_ADDRESS2",
"primaryaddressline3": "THE_ADDRESS3" } }>, the address field idenfiers
are C</form/primaryaddressline1>, C</form/primaryaddressline2>, and
C</form/primaryaddressline3>.

=item *

For form encoded payload types, use the HTML form names.

For example, for an HTML form with input elements named
C<primaryaddressline1>, C<primaryaddressline2>, and
C<primaryaddressline3>, the address fields identifiers are
C<primaryaddressline1>, C<primaryaddressline2>, and
C<primaryaddressline3>.
