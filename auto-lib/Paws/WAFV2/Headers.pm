=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::Headers

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::Headers object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MatchPattern => $value, ..., OversizeHandling => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::Headers object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MatchPattern

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inspect all headers in the web request. You can specify the parts of
the headers to inspect and you can narrow the set of headers to inspect
by including or excluding specific keys.

This is used to indicate the web request component to inspect, in the
FieldToMatch specification.

If you want to inspect just the value of a single header, use the
C<SingleHeader> C<FieldToMatch> setting instead.

Example JSON: C<"Headers": { "MatchPattern": { "All": {} },
"MatchScope": "KEY", "OversizeHandling": "MATCH" }>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MatchPattern => L<Paws::WAFV2::HeaderMatchPattern>

The filter to use to identify the subset of headers to inspect in a web
request.

You must specify exactly one setting: either C<All>,
C<IncludedHeaders>, or C<ExcludedHeaders>.

Example JSON: C<"MatchPattern": { "ExcludedHeaders": [ "KeyToExclude1",
"KeyToExclude2" ] }>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MatchScope => Str

The parts of the headers to match with the rule inspection criteria. If
you specify C<ALL>, WAF inspects both keys and values.

C<All> does not require a match to be found in the keys and a match to
be found in the values. It requires a match to be found in the keys or
the values or both. To require a match in the keys and in the values,
use a logical C<AND> statement to combine two match rules, one that
inspects the keys and another that inspects the values.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OversizeHandling => Str

What WAF should do if the headers of the request are more numerous or
larger than WAF can inspect. WAF does not support inspecting the entire
contents of request headers when they exceed 8 KB (8192 bytes) or 200
total headers. The underlying host service forwards a maximum of 200
headers and at most 8 KB of header contents to WAF.

The options for oversize handling are the following:

=over

=item *

C<CONTINUE> - Inspect the available headers normally, according to the
rule inspection criteria.

=item *

C<MATCH> - Treat the web request as matching the rule statement. WAF
applies the rule action to the request.

=item *

C<NO_MATCH> - Treat the web request as not matching the rule statement.
