=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::SqliMatchStatement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::SqliMatchStatement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldToMatch => $value, ..., TextTransformations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::SqliMatchStatement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldToMatch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule statement that inspects for malicious SQL code. Attackers insert
malicious SQL code into web requests to do things like modify your
database or extract data from it.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FieldToMatch => L<Paws::WAFV2::FieldToMatch>

The part of the web request that you want WAF to inspect.


=head2 SensitivityLevel => Str

The sensitivity that you want WAF to use to inspect for SQL injection
attacks.

C<HIGH> detects more attacks, but might generate more false positives,
especially if your web requests frequently contain unusual strings. For
information about identifying and mitigating false positives, see
Testing and tuning
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/web-acl-testing.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

C<LOW> is generally a better choice for resources that already have
other protections against SQL injection attacks or that have a low
tolerance for false positives.

Default: C<LOW>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TextTransformations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WAFV2::TextTransformation>]

Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that
attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. Text
transformations are used in rule match statements, to transform the
C<FieldToMatch> request component before inspecting it, and they're
used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components
before using them as custom aggregation keys. If you specify one or
more transformations to apply, WAF performs all transformations on the
specified content, starting from the lowest priority setting, and then
uses the transformed component contents.
