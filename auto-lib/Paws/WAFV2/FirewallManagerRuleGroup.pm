=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::FirewallManagerRuleGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::FirewallManagerRuleGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FirewallManagerStatement => $value, ..., VisibilityConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::FirewallManagerRuleGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FirewallManagerStatement

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A rule group that's defined for an Firewall Manager WAF policy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirewallManagerStatement => L<Paws::WAFV2::FirewallManagerStatement>

The processing guidance for an Firewall Manager rule. This is like a
regular rule Statement, but it can only contain a rule group reference.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule group
after you create it.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OverrideAction => L<Paws::WAFV2::OverrideAction>

The action to use in the place of the action that results from the rule
group evaluation. Set the override action to none to leave the result
of the rule group alone. Set it to count to override the result to
count only.

You can only use this for rule statements that reference a rule group,
like C<RuleGroupReferenceStatement> and C<ManagedRuleGroupStatement>.

This option is usually set to none. It does not affect how the rules in
the rule group are evaluated. If you want the rules in the rule group
to only count matches, do not use this and instead use the rule action
override option, with C<Count> action, in your rule group reference
statement settings.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Priority => Int

If you define more than one rule group in the first or last Firewall
Manager rule groups, WAF evaluates each request against the rule groups
in order, starting from the lowest priority setting. The priorities
don't need to be consecutive, but they must all be different.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VisibilityConfig => L<Paws::WAFV2::VisibilityConfig>

Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample
collection.
