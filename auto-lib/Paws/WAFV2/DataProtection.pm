=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::DataProtection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::DataProtection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., Field => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::DataProtection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the protection behavior for a field type. This is part of the
data protection configuration for a web ACL.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => Str

Specifies how to protect the field. WAF can apply a one-way hash to the
field or hard code a string substitution.

=over

=item *

One-way hash example:
C<ade099751dEXAMPLEHASH2ea9f3393f80dd5d3bEXAMPLEHASH966ae0d3cd5a1e>

=item *

Substitution example: C<REDACTED>

=back



=head2 ExcludeRateBasedDetails => Bool

Specifies whether to also exclude any rate-based rule details from the
data protection you have enabled for a given field. If you specify this
exception, RateBasedDetails will show the value of the field. For
additional information, see the log field C<rateBasedRuleList> at Log
fields for web ACL traffic
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

Default: C<FALSE>


=head2 ExcludeRuleMatchDetails => Bool

Specifies whether to also exclude any rule match details from the data
protection you have enabled for a given field. WAF logs these details
for non-terminating matching rules and for the terminating matching
rule. For additional information, see Log fields for web ACL traffic
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/logging-fields.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.

Default: C<FALSE>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Field => L<Paws::WAFV2::FieldToProtect>

Specifies the field type and optional keys to apply the protection
behavior to.
