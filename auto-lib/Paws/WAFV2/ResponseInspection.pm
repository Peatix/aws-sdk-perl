=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BodyContains => $value, ..., StatusCode => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BodyContains

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The criteria for inspecting responses to login requests and account
creation requests, used by the ATP and ACFP rule groups to track login
and account creation success and failure rates.

Response inspection is available only in web ACLs that protect Amazon
CloudFront distributions.

The rule groups evaluates the responses that your protected resources
send back to client login and account creation attempts, keeping count
of successful and failed attempts from each IP address and client
session. Using this information, the rule group labels and mitigates
requests from client sessions and IP addresses with too much suspicious
activity in a short amount of time.

This is part of the C<AWSManagedRulesATPRuleSet> and
C<AWSManagedRulesACFPRuleSet> configurations in
C<ManagedRuleGroupConfig>.

Enable response inspection by configuring exactly one component of the
response to inspect, for example, C<Header> or C<StatusCode>. You can't
configure more than one component for inspection. If you don't
configure any of the response inspection options, response inspection
is disabled.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BodyContains => L<Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionBodyContains>

Configures inspection of the response body for success and failure
indicators. WAF can inspect the first 65,536 bytes (64 KB) of the
response body.


=head2 Header => L<Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionHeader>

Configures inspection of the response header for success and failure
indicators.


=head2 Json => L<Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionJson>

Configures inspection of the response JSON for success and failure
indicators. WAF can inspect the first 65,536 bytes (64 KB) of the
response JSON.


=head2 StatusCode => L<Paws::WAFV2::ResponseInspectionStatusCode>

Configures inspection of the response status code for success and
failure indicators.
