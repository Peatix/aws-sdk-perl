=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::RuleGroupSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::RuleGroupSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ARN => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::RuleGroupSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

High-level information about a RuleGroup, returned by operations like
create and list. This provides information like the ID, that you can
use to retrieve and manage a C<RuleGroup>, and the ARN, that you
provide to the RuleGroupReferenceStatement to use the rule group in a
Rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the rule group that helps with identification.


=head2 Id => Str

A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the
responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations
like update and delete.


=head2 LockToken => Str

A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your C<get>
and C<list> requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of
the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token,
you provide the token to operations like C<update> and C<delete>. WAF
uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity
since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update
fails with a C<WAFOptimisticLockException>. If this happens, perform
another C<get>, and use the new token returned by that operation.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the data type instance. You cannot change the name after
you create the instance.
