=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::GetRuleGroup - Arguments for method GetRuleGroup on L<Paws::WAFV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetRuleGroup on the
L<AWS WAFV2|Paws::WAFV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetRuleGroup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetRuleGroup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $wafv2 = Paws->service('WAFV2');
    my $GetRuleGroupResponse = $wafv2->GetRuleGroup(
      ARN   => 'MyResourceArn',    # OPTIONAL
      Id    => 'MyEntityId',       # OPTIONAL
      Name  => 'MyEntityName',     # OPTIONAL
      Scope => 'CLOUDFRONT',       # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $LockToken = $GetRuleGroupResponse->LockToken;
    my $RuleGroup = $GetRuleGroupResponse->RuleGroup;

    # Returns a L<Paws::WAFV2::GetRuleGroupResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
