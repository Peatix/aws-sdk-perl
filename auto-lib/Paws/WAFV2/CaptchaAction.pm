=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::CaptchaAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::CaptchaAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomRequestHandling => $value, ..., CustomRequestHandling => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::CaptchaAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomRequestHandling

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies that WAF should run a C<CAPTCHA> check against the request:

=over

=item *

If the request includes a valid, unexpired C<CAPTCHA> token, WAF
applies any custom request handling and labels that you've configured
and then allows the web request inspection to proceed to the next rule,
similar to a C<CountAction>.

=item *

If the request doesn't include a valid, unexpired token, WAF
discontinues the web ACL evaluation of the request and blocks it from
going to its intended destination.

WAF generates a response that it sends back to the client, which
includes the following:

=over

=item *

The header C<x-amzn-waf-action> with a value of C<captcha>.

=item *

The HTTP status code C<405 Method Not Allowed>.

=item *

If the request contains an C<Accept> header with a value of
C<text/html>, the response includes a C<CAPTCHA> JavaScript page
interstitial.

=back

=back

You can configure the expiration time in the C<CaptchaConfig>
C<ImmunityTimeProperty> setting at the rule and web ACL level. The rule
setting overrides the web ACL setting.

This action option is available for rules. It isn't available for web
ACL default actions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomRequestHandling => L<Paws::WAFV2::CustomRequestHandling>

Defines custom handling for the web request, used when the C<CAPTCHA>
inspection determines that the request's token is valid and unexpired.

For information about customizing web requests and responses, see
Customizing web requests and responses in WAF
