=head1 NAME

Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetVersion

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetVersion object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociatedRuleGroupArn => $value, ..., PublishTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WAFV2::ManagedRuleSetVersion object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociatedRuleGroupArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information for a single version of a managed rule set.

This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Vendors
are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace sellers.

Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your
customers. The APIs are C<ListManagedRuleSets>, C<GetManagedRuleSet>,
C<PutManagedRuleSetVersions>, and
C<UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociatedRuleGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the vendor rule group that's used to
define the published version of your managed rule group.


=head2 Capacity => Int

The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are
used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates
capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost
of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than
more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity
is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage
when they use a rule group. For more information, see WAF web ACL
capacity units (WCU)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-waf-capacity-units.html)
in the I<WAF Developer Guide>.


=head2 ExpiryTimestamp => Str

The time that this version is set to expire.

Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format
includes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".


=head2 ForecastedLifetime => Int

The amount of time you expect this version of your managed rule group
to last, in days.


=head2 LastUpdateTimestamp => Str

The last time that you updated this version.

Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format
includes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".


=head2 PublishTimestamp => Str

The time that you first published this version.

Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format
includes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".
