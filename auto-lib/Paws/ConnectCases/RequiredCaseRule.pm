=head1 NAME

Paws::ConnectCases::RequiredCaseRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ConnectCases::RequiredCaseRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Conditions => $value, ..., DefaultValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ConnectCases::RequiredCaseRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Conditions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Required rule type, used to indicate whether a field is required. In
the Amazon Connect admin website, case rules are known as I<case field
conditions>. For more information about case field conditions, see Add
case field conditions to a case template
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-field-conditions.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Conditions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanCondition>]

List of conditions for the required rule; the first condition to
evaluate to true dictates the value of the rule.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultValue => Bool

The value of the rule (that is, whether the field is required) should
none of the conditions evaluate to true.
