=head1 NAME

Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanCondition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanCondition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EqualTo => $value, ..., NotEqualTo => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanCondition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EqualTo

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Boolean condition for a rule. In the Amazon Connect admin website, case
rules are known as I<case field conditions>. For more information about
case field conditions, see Add case field conditions to a case template
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-field-conditions.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EqualTo => L<Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanOperands>

Tests that operandOne is equal to operandTwo.


=head2 NotEqualTo => L<Paws::ConnectCases::BooleanOperands>

Tests that operandOne is not equal to operandTwo.
