=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::EnvironmentFile

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::EnvironmentFile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::EnvironmentFile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a
container. You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must
have a C<.env> file extension. Each line in an environment file should
contain an environment variable in C<VARIABLE=VALUE> format. Lines
beginning with C<#> are treated as comments and are ignored.

If there are environment variables specified using the C<environment>
parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the
variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment
files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed
from the top down. We recommend that you use unique variable names. For
more information, see Use a file to pass environment variables to a
container
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/use-environment-file.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

Environment variable files are objects in Amazon S3 and all Amazon S3
security considerations apply.

You must use the following platforms for the Fargate launch type:

=over

=item *

Linux platform version C<1.4.0> or later.

=item *

Windows platform version C<1.0.0> or later.

=back

Consider the following when using the Fargate launch type:

=over

=item *

The file is handled like a native Docker env-file.

=item *

There is no support for shell escape handling.

=item *

The container entry point interperts the C<VARIABLE> values.

=back
