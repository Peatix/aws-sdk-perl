=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::EFSAuthorizationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::EFSAuthorizationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessPointId => $value, ..., Iam => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::EFSAuthorizationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessPointId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The authorization configuration details for the Amazon EFS file system.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessPointId => Str

The Amazon EFS access point ID to use. If an access point is specified,
the root directory value specified in the C<EFSVolumeConfiguration>
must either be omitted or set to C</> which will enforce the path set
on the EFS access point. If an access point is used, transit encryption
must be on in the C<EFSVolumeConfiguration>. For more information, see
Working with Amazon EFS access points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/efs-access-points.html) in
the I<Amazon Elastic File System User Guide>.


=head2 Iam => Str

Determines whether to use the Amazon ECS task role defined in a task
definition when mounting the Amazon EFS file system. If it is turned
on, transit encryption must be turned on in the
C<EFSVolumeConfiguration>. If this parameter is omitted, the default
value of C<DISABLED> is used. For more information, see Using Amazon
EFS access points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/efs-volumes.html#efs-volume-accesspoints)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.
