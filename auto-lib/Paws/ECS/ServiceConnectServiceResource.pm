=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectServiceResource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectServiceResource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DiscoveryArn => $value, ..., DiscoveryName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectServiceResource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DiscoveryArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Service Connect resource. Each configuration maps a discovery name
to a Cloud Map service name. The data is stored in Cloud Map as part of
the Service Connect configuration for each discovery name of this
Amazon ECS service.

A task can resolve the C<dnsName> for each of the C<clientAliases> of a
service. However a task can't resolve the discovery names. If you want
to connect to a service, refer to the C<ServiceConnectConfiguration> of
that service for the list of C<clientAliases> that you can use.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DiscoveryArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the namespace in Cloud Map that
matches the discovery name for this Service Connect resource. You can
use this ARN in other integrations with Cloud Map. However, Service
Connect can't ensure connectivity outside of Amazon ECS.


=head2 DiscoveryName => Str

The discovery name of this Service Connect resource.

The C<discoveryName> is the name of the new Cloud Map service that
Amazon ECS creates for this Amazon ECS service. This must be unique
within the Cloud Map namespace. The name can contain up to 64
characters. The name can include lowercase letters, numbers,
underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The name can't start with a hyphen.

If the C<discoveryName> isn't specified, the port mapping name from the
task definition is used in C<portName.namespace>.
