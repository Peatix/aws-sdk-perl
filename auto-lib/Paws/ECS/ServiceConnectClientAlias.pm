=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectClientAlias

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectClientAlias object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DnsName => $value, ..., Port => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectClientAlias object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DnsName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each alias ("endpoint") is a fully-qualified name and port number that
other tasks ("clients") can use to connect to this service.

Each name and port mapping must be unique within the namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to
services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of
the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
Connect. For more information, see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DnsName => Str

The C<dnsName> is the name that you use in the applications of client
tasks to connect to this service. The name must be a valid DNS name but
doesn't need to be fully-qualified. The name can include up to 127
characters. The name can include lowercase letters, numbers,
underscores (_), hyphens (-), and periods (.). The name can't start
with a hyphen.

If this parameter isn't specified, the default value of
C<discoveryName.namespace> is used. If the C<discoveryName> isn't
specified, the port mapping name from the task definition is used in
C<portName.namespace>.

To avoid changing your applications in client Amazon ECS services, set
this to the same name that the client application uses by default. For
example, a few common names are C<database>, C<db>, or the lowercase
name of a database, such as C<mysql> or C<redis>. For more information,
see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Port => Int

The listening port number for the Service Connect proxy. This port is
available inside of all of the tasks within the same namespace.

To avoid changing your applications in client Amazon ECS services, set
this to the same port that the client application uses by default. For
more information, see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.
