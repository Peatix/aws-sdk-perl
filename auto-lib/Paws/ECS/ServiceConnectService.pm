=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectService

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectService object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientAliases => $value, ..., Tls => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectService object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientAliases

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Service Connect service object configuration. For more information,
see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientAliases => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectClientAlias>]

The list of client aliases for this Service Connect service. You use
these to assign names that can be used by client applications. The
maximum number of client aliases that you can have in this list is 1.

Each alias ("endpoint") is a fully-qualified name and port number that
other Amazon ECS tasks ("clients") can use to connect to this service.

Each name and port mapping must be unique within the namespace.

For each C<ServiceConnectService>, you must provide at least one
C<clientAlias> with one C<port>.


=head2 DiscoveryName => Str

The C<discoveryName> is the name of the new Cloud Map service that
Amazon ECS creates for this Amazon ECS service. This must be unique
within the Cloud Map namespace. The name can contain up to 64
characters. The name can include lowercase letters, numbers,
underscores (_), and hyphens (-). The name can't start with a hyphen.

If the C<discoveryName> isn't specified, the port mapping name from the
task definition is used in C<portName.namespace>.


=head2 IngressPortOverride => Int

The port number for the Service Connect proxy to listen on.

Use the value of this field to bypass the proxy for traffic on the port
number specified in the named C<portMapping> in the task definition of
this application, and then use it in your VPC security groups to allow
traffic into the proxy for this Amazon ECS service.

In C<awsvpc> mode and Fargate, the default value is the container port
number. The container port number is in the C<portMapping> in the task
definition. In bridge mode, the default value is the ephemeral port of
the Service Connect proxy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PortName => Str

The C<portName> must match the name of one of the C<portMappings> from
all the containers in the task definition of this Amazon ECS service.


=head2 Timeout => L<Paws::ECS::TimeoutConfiguration>

A reference to an object that represents the configured timeouts for
Service Connect.


=head2 Tls => L<Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectTlsConfiguration>

A reference to an object that represents a Transport Layer Security
(TLS) configuration.
