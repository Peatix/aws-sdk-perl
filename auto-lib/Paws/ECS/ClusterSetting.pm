=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ClusterSetting

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ClusterSetting object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ClusterSetting object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The settings to use when creating a cluster. This parameter is used to
turn on CloudWatch Container Insights with enhanced observability or
CloudWatch Container Insights for a cluster.

Container Insights with enhanced observability provides all the
Container Insights metrics, plus additional task and container metrics.
This version supports enhanced observability for Amazon ECS clusters
using the Amazon EC2 and Fargate launch types. After you configure
Container Insights with enhanced observability on Amazon ECS, Container
Insights auto-collects detailed infrastructure telemetry from the
cluster level down to the container level in your environment and
displays these critical performance data in curated dashboards removing
the heavy lifting in observability set-up.

For more information, see Monitor Amazon ECS containers using Container
Insights with enhanced observability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cloudwatch-container-insights.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the cluster setting. The value is C<containerInsights> .
