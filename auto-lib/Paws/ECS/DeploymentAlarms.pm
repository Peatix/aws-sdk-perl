=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::DeploymentAlarms

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::DeploymentAlarms object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmNames => $value, ..., Rollback => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::DeploymentAlarms object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the methods which provide a way for you to quickly identify when
a deployment has failed, and then to optionally roll back the failure
to the last working deployment.

When the alarms are generated, Amazon ECS sets the service deployment
to failed. Set the rollback parameter to have Amazon ECS to roll back
your service to the last completed deployment after a failure.

You can only use the C<DeploymentAlarms> method to detect failures when
the C<DeploymentController> is set to C<ECS> (rolling update).

For more information, see Rolling update
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html)
in the I< I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide> >.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AlarmNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more CloudWatch alarm names. Use a "," to separate the alarms.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enable => Bool

Determines whether to use the CloudWatch alarm option in the service
deployment process.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Rollback => Bool

Determines whether to configure Amazon ECS to roll back the service if
a service deployment fails. If rollback is used, when a service
deployment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment
that completed successfully.
