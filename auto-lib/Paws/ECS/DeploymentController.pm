=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::DeploymentController

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::DeploymentController object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::DeploymentController object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The deployment controller to use for the service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The deployment controller type to use.

There are three deployment controller types available:

=over

=item ECS

The rolling update (C<ECS>) deployment type involves replacing the
current running version of the container with the latest version. The
number of containers Amazon ECS adds or removes from the service during
a rolling update is controlled by adjusting the minimum and maximum
number of healthy tasks allowed during a service deployment, as
specified in the DeploymentConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeploymentConfiguration.html).

For more information about rolling deployments, see Deploy Amazon ECS
services by replacing tasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=item CODE_DEPLOY

The blue/green (C<CODE_DEPLOY>) deployment type uses the blue/green
deployment model powered by CodeDeploy, which allows you to verify a
new deployment of a service before sending production traffic to it.

For more information about blue/green deployments, see Validate the
state of an Amazon ECS service before deployment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=item EXTERNAL

The external (C<EXTERNAL>) deployment type enables you to use any
third-party deployment controller for full control over the deployment
process for an Amazon ECS service.

For more information about external deployments, see Deploy Amazon ECS
services using a third-party controller
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-external.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.
