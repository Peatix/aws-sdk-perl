=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceDeployment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceDeployment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Alarms => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceDeployment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Alarms

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the service deployment.

Service deployments provide a comprehensive view of your deployments.
For information about service deployments, see View service history
using Amazon ECS service deployments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-deployment.html)
in the I< I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide> >.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Alarms => L<Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentAlarms>

The CloudWatch alarms that determine when a service deployment fails.


=head2 ClusterArn => Str

The ARN of the cluster that hosts the service.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time the service deployment was created. The format is yyyy-MM-dd
HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.


=head2 DeploymentCircuitBreaker => L<Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentCircuitBreaker>

The circuit breaker configuration that determines a service deployment
failed.


=head2 DeploymentConfiguration => L<Paws::ECS::DeploymentConfiguration>




=head2 FinishedAt => Str

The time the service deployment finished. The format is yyyy-MM-dd
HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.


=head2 Rollback => L<Paws::ECS::Rollback>

The rollback options the service deployment uses when the deployment
fails.


=head2 ServiceArn => Str

The ARN of the service for this service deployment.


=head2 ServiceDeploymentArn => Str

The ARN of the service deployment.


=head2 SourceServiceRevisions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECS::ServiceRevisionSummary>]

The currently deployed workload configuration.


=head2 StartedAt => Str

The time the service deployment statred. The format is yyyy-MM-dd
HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.


=head2 Status => Str

The service deployment state.


=head2 StatusReason => Str

Information about why the service deployment is in the current status.
For example, the circuit breaker detected a failure.


=head2 StoppedAt => Str

The time the service deployment stopped. The format is yyyy-MM-dd
HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.

The service deployment stops when any of the following actions happen:

=over

=item *

A user manually stops the deployment

=item *

The rollback option is not in use for the failure detection mechanism
(the circuit breaker or alarm-based) and the service fails.

=back



=head2 TargetServiceRevision => L<Paws::ECS::ServiceRevisionSummary>

The workload configuration being deployed.


=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The time that the service deployment was last updated. The format is
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS.
