=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentCircuitBreaker

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentCircuitBreaker object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FailureCount => $value, ..., Threshold => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentCircuitBreaker object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FailureCount

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the circuit breaker used to determine when a service
deployment has failed.

The deployment circuit breaker is the rolling update mechanism that
determines if the tasks reach a steady state. The deployment circuit
breaker has an option that will automatically roll back a failed
deployment to the last cpompleted service revision. For more
information, see How the Amazon ECS deployment circuit breaker detects
failures
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-circuit-breaker.html)
in theI< Amazon ECS Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FailureCount => Int

The number of times the circuit breaker detected a service deploymeny
failure.


=head2 Status => Str

The circuit breaker status. Amazon ECS is not using the circuit breaker
for service deployment failures when the status is C<DISABLED>.


=head2 Threshold => Int

The threshhold which determines that the service deployment failed.

The deployment circuit breaker calculates the threshold value, and then
uses the value to determine when to move the deployment to a FAILED
state. The deployment circuit breaker has a minimum threshold of 3 and
a maximum threshold of 200. and uses the values in the following
formula to determine the deployment failure.

C<0.5 * desired task count>
