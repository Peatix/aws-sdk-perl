=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ClusterServiceConnectDefaultsRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ClusterServiceConnectDefaultsRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Namespace => $value, ..., Namespace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ClusterServiceConnectDefaultsRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Namespace

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this parameter to set a default Service Connect namespace. After
you set a default Service Connect namespace, any new services with
Service Connect turned on that are created in the cluster are added as
client services in the namespace. This setting only applies to new
services that set the C<enabled> parameter to C<true> in the
C<ServiceConnectConfiguration>. You can set the namespace of each
service individually in the C<ServiceConnectConfiguration> to override
this default parameter.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to
services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of
the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
Connect. For more information, see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Namespace => Str

The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Cloud Map
namespace that's used when you create a service and don't specify a
Service Connect configuration. The namespace name can include up to
1024 characters. The name is case-sensitive. The name can't include
greater than (E<gt>), less than (E<lt>), double quotation marks ("), or
slash (/).

If you enter an existing namespace name or ARN, then that namespace
will be used. Any namespace type is supported. The namespace must be in
this account and this Amazon Web Services Region.

If you enter a new name, a Cloud Map namespace will be created. Amazon
ECS creates a Cloud Map namespace with the "API calls" method of
instance discovery only. This instance discovery method is the "HTTP"
namespace type in the Command Line Interface. Other types of instance
discovery aren't used by Service Connect.

If you update the cluster with an empty string C<""> for the namespace
name, the cluster configuration for Service Connect is removed. Note
that the namespace will remain in Cloud Map and must be deleted
separately.

For more information about Cloud Map, see Working with Services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.html)
in the I<Cloud Map Developer Guide>.
