=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::TaskEphemeralStorage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::TaskEphemeralStorage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyId => $value, ..., SizeInGiB => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::TaskEphemeralStorage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The amount of ephemeral storage to allocate for the task.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

Specify an Key Management Service key ID to encrypt the ephemeral
storage for the task.


=head2 SizeInGiB => Int

The total amount, in GiB, of the ephemeral storage to set for the task.
The minimum supported value is C<20> GiB and the maximum supported
value is C<200> GiB.
