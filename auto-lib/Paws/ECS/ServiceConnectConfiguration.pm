=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., Services => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Service Connect configuration of your Amazon ECS service. The
configuration for this service to discover and connect to services, and
be discovered by, and connected from, other services within a
namespace.

Tasks that run in a namespace can use short names to connect to
services in the namespace. Tasks can connect to services across all of
the clusters in the namespace. Tasks connect through a managed proxy
container that collects logs and metrics for increased visibility. Only
the tasks that Amazon ECS services create are supported with Service
Connect. For more information, see Service Connect
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

Specifies whether to use Service Connect with this service.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::ECS::LogConfiguration>




=head2 Namespace => Str

The namespace name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Cloud Map
namespace for use with Service Connect. The namespace must be in the
same Amazon Web Services Region as the Amazon ECS service and cluster.
The type of namespace doesn't affect Service Connect. For more
information about Cloud Map, see Working with Services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/working-with-services.html)
in the I<Cloud Map Developer Guide>.


=head2 Services => ArrayRef[L<Paws::ECS::ServiceConnectService>]

The list of Service Connect service objects. These are names and
aliases (also known as endpoints) that are used by other Amazon ECS
services to connect to this service.

This field is not required for a "client" Amazon ECS service that's a
member of a namespace only to connect to other services within the
namespace. An example of this would be a frontend application that
accepts incoming requests from either a load balancer that's attached
to the service or by other means.

An object selects a port from the task definition, assigns a name for
the Cloud Map service, and a list of aliases (endpoints) and ports for
client applications to refer to this service.
