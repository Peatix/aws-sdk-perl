=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::DeploymentCircuitBreaker

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::DeploymentCircuitBreaker object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enable => $value, ..., Rollback => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::DeploymentCircuitBreaker object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The deployment circuit breaker can only be used for services using the
rolling update (C<ECS>) deployment type.

The B<deployment circuit breaker> determines whether a service
deployment will fail if the service can't reach a steady state. If it
is turned on, a service deployment will transition to a failed state
and stop launching new tasks. You can also configure Amazon ECS to roll
back your service to the last completed deployment after a failure. For
more information, see Rolling update
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

For more information about API failure reasons, see API failure reasons
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/api_failures_messages.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enable => Bool

Determines whether to use the deployment circuit breaker logic for the
service.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Rollback => Bool

Determines whether to configure Amazon ECS to roll back the service if
a service deployment fails. If rollback is on, when a service
deployment fails, the service is rolled back to the last deployment
that completed successfully.
