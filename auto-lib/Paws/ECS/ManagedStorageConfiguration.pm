=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ManagedStorageConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ManagedStorageConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId => $value, ..., KmsKeyId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ManagedStorageConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The managed storage configuration for the cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId => Str

Specify the Key Management Service key ID for Fargate ephemeral
storage.

When you specify a C<fargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId>, Amazon Web
Services Fargate uses the key to encrypt data at rest in ephemeral
storage. For more information about Fargate ephemeral storage
encryption, see Customer managed keys for Amazon Web Services Fargate
ephemeral storage for Amazon ECS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/fargate-storage-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

The key must be a single Region key.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

Specify a Key Management Service key ID to encrypt Amazon ECS managed
storage.

When you specify a C<kmsKeyId>, Amazon ECS uses the key to encrypt data
volumes managed by Amazon ECS that are attached to tasks in the
cluster. The following data volumes are managed by Amazon ECS: Amazon
EBS. For more information about encryption of Amazon EBS volumes
attached to Amazon ECS tasks, see Encrypt data stored in Amazon EBS
volumes for Amazon ECS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ebs-kms-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

The key must be a single Region key.
