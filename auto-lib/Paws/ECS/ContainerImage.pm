=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::ContainerImage

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ContainerImage object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerName => $value, ..., ImageDigest => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ContainerImage object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details about the container image a service revision uses.

To ensure that all tasks in a service use the same container image,
Amazon ECS resolves container image names and any image tags specified
in the task definition to container image digests.

After the container image digest has been established, Amazon ECS uses
the digest to start any other desired tasks, and for any future service
and service revision updates. This leads to all tasks in a service
always running identical container images, resulting in version
consistency for your software. For more information, see Container
image resolution
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-ecs.html#deployment-container-image-stability)
in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.
