=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::NetworkBinding

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::NetworkBinding object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BindIP => $value, ..., Protocol => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::NetworkBinding object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BindIP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Details on the network bindings between a container and its host
container instance. After a task reaches the C<RUNNING> status, manual
and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the
C<networkBindings> section of DescribeTasks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html)
API responses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BindIP => Str

The IP address that the container is bound to on the container
instance.


=head2 ContainerPort => Int

The port number on the container that's used with the network binding.


=head2 ContainerPortRange => Str

The port number range on the container that's bound to the dynamically
mapped host port range.

The following rules apply when you specify a C<containerPortRange>:

=over

=item *

You must use either the C<bridge> network mode or the C<awsvpc> network
mode.

=item *

This parameter is available for both the EC2 and Fargate launch types.

=item *

This parameter is available for both the Linux and Windows operating
systems.

=item *

The container instance must have at least version 1.67.0 of the
container agent and at least version 1.67.0-1 of the C<ecs-init>
package

=item *

You can specify a maximum of 100 port ranges per container.

=item *

You do not specify a C<hostPortRange>. The value of the
C<hostPortRange> is set as follows:

=over

=item *

For containers in a task with the C<awsvpc> network mode, the
C<hostPortRange> is set to the same value as the C<containerPortRange>.
This is a static mapping strategy.

=item *

For containers in a task with the C<bridge> network mode, the Amazon
ECS agent finds open host ports from the default ephemeral range and
passes it to docker to bind them to the container ports.

=back

=item *

The C<containerPortRange> valid values are between 1 and 65535.

=item *

A port can only be included in one port mapping per container.

=item *

You cannot specify overlapping port ranges.

=item *

The first port in the range must be less than last port in the range.

=item *

Docker recommends that you turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker
daemon config file when you have a large number of ports.

For more information, see Issue #11185
(https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/11185) on the Github website.

For information about how to turn off the docker-proxy in the Docker
daemon config file, see Docker daemon
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/bootstrap_container_instance.html#bootstrap_docker_daemon)
in the I<Amazon ECS Developer Guide>.

=back

You can call C<DescribeTasks>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTasks.html)
to view the C<hostPortRange> which are the host ports that are bound to
the container ports.


=head2 HostPort => Int

The port number on the host that's used with the network binding.


=head2 HostPortRange => Str

The port number range on the host that's used with the network binding.
This is assigned is assigned by Docker and delivered by the Amazon ECS
agent.


=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocol used for the network binding.
