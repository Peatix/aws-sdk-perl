=head1 NAME

Paws::ECS::TimeoutConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::TimeoutConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IdleTimeoutSeconds => $value, ..., PerRequestTimeoutSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::TimeoutConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IdleTimeoutSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that represents the timeout configurations for Service
Connect.

If C<idleTimeout> is set to a time that is less than
C<perRequestTimeout>, the connection will close when the C<idleTimeout>
is reached and not the C<perRequestTimeout>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IdleTimeoutSeconds => Int

The amount of time in seconds a connection will stay active while idle.
A value of C<0> can be set to disable C<idleTimeout>.

The C<idleTimeout> default for C<HTTP>/C<HTTP2>/C<GRPC> is 5 minutes.

The C<idleTimeout> default for C<TCP> is 1 hour.


=head2 PerRequestTimeoutSeconds => Int

The amount of time waiting for the upstream to respond with a complete
response per request. A value of C<0> can be set to disable
C<perRequestTimeout>. C<perRequestTimeout> can only be set if Service
Connect C<appProtocol> isn't C<TCP>. Only C<idleTimeout> is allowed for
C<TCP> C<appProtocol>.
