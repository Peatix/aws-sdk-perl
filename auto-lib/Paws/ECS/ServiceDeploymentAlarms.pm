=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentAlarms object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AlarmNames => $value, ..., TriggeredAlarmNames => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ECS::ServiceDeploymentAlarms object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AlarmNames

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CloudWatch alarms used to determine a service deployment failed.

Amazon ECS considers the service deployment as failed when any of the
alarms move to the C<ALARM> state. For more information, see How
CloudWatch alarms detect Amazon ECS deployment failures
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-alarm-failure.html)
in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AlarmNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The name of the CloudWatch alarms that determine when a service
deployment failed. A "," separates the alarms.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the alarms check. Amazon ECS is not using alarms for
service deployment failures when the status is C<DISABLED>.


=head2 TriggeredAlarmNames => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more CloudWatch alarm names that have been triggered during the
service deployment. A "," separates the alarm names.
