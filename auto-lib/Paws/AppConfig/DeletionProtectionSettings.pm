Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppConfig::DeletionProtectionSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., ProtectionPeriodInMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppConfig::DeletionProtectionSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A parameter to configure deletion protection. Deletion protection
prevents a user from deleting a configuration profile or an environment
if AppConfig has called either GetLatestConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/2019-10-09/APIReference/API_appconfigdata_GetLatestConfiguration.html)
or for the configuration profile or from the environment during the
specified interval.

The default interval specified by C<ProtectionPeriodInMinutes> is 60.
C<DeletionProtectionCheck> skips configuration profiles and
environments that were created in the past hour.
