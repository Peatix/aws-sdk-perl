=head1 NAME

Paws::AppConfig::UpdateDeploymentStrategy - Arguments for method UpdateDeploymentStrategy on L<Paws::AppConfig>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateDeploymentStrategy on the
L<Amazon AppConfig|Paws::AppConfig> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateDeploymentStrategy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateDeploymentStrategy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appconfig = Paws->service('AppConfig');
# To update a deployment strategy
# The following update-deployment-strategy example updates final bake time to 20
# minutes in the specified deployment strategy. ::

    my $DeploymentStrategy = $appconfig->UpdateDeploymentStrategy(
      'DeploymentStrategyId'   => '1225qzk',
      'FinalBakeTimeInMinutes' => 20
    );

    # Results:
    my $DeploymentDurationInMinutes =
      $DeploymentStrategy->DeploymentDurationInMinutes;
    my $FinalBakeTimeInMinutes = $DeploymentStrategy->FinalBakeTimeInMinutes;
    my $GrowthFactor           = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthFactor;
    my $GrowthType             = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthType;
    my $Id                     = $DeploymentStrategy->Id;
    my $Name                   = $DeploymentStrategy->Name;
    my $ReplicateTo            = $DeploymentStrategy->ReplicateTo;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppConfig::DeploymentStrategy> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeploymentDurationInMinutes => Int

Total amount of time for a deployment to last.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentStrategyId => Str

The deployment strategy ID.



=head2 Description => Str

A description of the deployment strategy.



=head2 FinalBakeTimeInMinutes => Int

The amount of time that AppConfig monitors for alarms before
considering the deployment to be complete and no longer eligible for
automatic rollback.



=head2 GrowthFactor => Num

The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
each interval.



=head2 GrowthType => Str

The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppConfig
supports the following growth types:

B<Linear>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by
increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the deployment
time. For example, a linear deployment that uses a growth factor of 20
initially makes the configuration available to 20 percent of the
targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time has passed, the system
updates the percentage to 40 percent. This continues until 100% of the
targets are set to receive the deployed configuration.

B<Exponential>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment
exponentially using the following formula: C<G*(2^N)>. In this formula,
C<G> is the growth factor specified by the user and C<N> is the number
of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For
example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out
the configuration as follows:

C<2*(2^0)>

C<2*(2^1)>

C<2*(2^2)>

Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the
targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the
configuration has been deployed to all targets.

Valid values are: C<"LINEAR">, C<"EXPONENTIAL">
