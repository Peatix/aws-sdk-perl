=head1 NAME

Paws::AppConfig::CreateDeploymentStrategy - Arguments for method CreateDeploymentStrategy on L<Paws::AppConfig>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDeploymentStrategy on the
L<Amazon AppConfig|Paws::AppConfig> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDeploymentStrategy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDeploymentStrategy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $appconfig = Paws->service('AppConfig');
# To create a deployment strategy
# The following create-deployment-strategy example creates a deployment strategy
# called Example-Deployment that takes 15 minutes and deploys the configuration
# to 25% of the application at a time. The strategy is also copied to an SSM
# Document.
    my $DeploymentStrategy = $appconfig->CreateDeploymentStrategy(
      'DeploymentDurationInMinutes' => 15,
      'GrowthFactor'                => 25,
      'Name'                        => 'Example-Deployment',
      'ReplicateTo'                 => 'SSM_DOCUMENT'
    );

    # Results:
    my $DeploymentDurationInMinutes =
      $DeploymentStrategy->DeploymentDurationInMinutes;
    my $FinalBakeTimeInMinutes = $DeploymentStrategy->FinalBakeTimeInMinutes;
    my $GrowthFactor           = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthFactor;
    my $GrowthType             = $DeploymentStrategy->GrowthType;
    my $Id                     = $DeploymentStrategy->Id;
    my $Name                   = $DeploymentStrategy->Name;
    my $ReplicateTo            = $DeploymentStrategy->ReplicateTo;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AppConfig::DeploymentStrategy> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeploymentDurationInMinutes => Int

Total amount of time for a deployment to last.



=head2 Description => Str

A description of the deployment strategy.



=head2 FinalBakeTimeInMinutes => Int

Specifies the amount of time AppConfig monitors for Amazon CloudWatch
alarms after the configuration has been deployed to 100% of its
targets, before considering the deployment to be complete. If an alarm
is triggered during this time, AppConfig rolls back the deployment. You
must configure permissions for AppConfig to roll back based on
CloudWatch alarms. For more information, see Configuring permissions
for rollback based on Amazon CloudWatch alarms
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-appconfig-cloudwatch-alarms-permissions.html)
in the I<AppConfig User Guide>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> GrowthFactor => Num

The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
each interval.



=head2 GrowthType => Str

The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppConfig
supports the following growth types:

B<Linear>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by
dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for C<Step
percentage>. For example, a linear deployment that uses a C<Step
percentage> of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the hosts.
After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the
configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the
targets have successfully received the configuration.

B<Exponential>: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment
exponentially using the following formula: C<G*(2^N)>. In this formula,
C<G> is the growth factor specified by the user and C<N> is the number
of steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For
example, if you specify a growth factor of 2, then the system rolls out
the configuration as follows:

C<2*(2^0)>

C<2*(2^1)>

C<2*(2^2)>

Expressed numerically, the deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of the
targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues until the
configuration has been deployed to all targets.

Valid values are: C<"LINEAR">, C<"EXPONENTIAL">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A name for the deployment strategy.



=head2 ReplicateTo => Str

Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.

Valid values are: C<"NONE">, C<"SSM_DOCUMENT">

=head2 Tags => L<Paws::AppConfig::TagMap>

Metadata to assign to the deployment strategy. Tags help organize and
categorize your AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value, both of which you define.
