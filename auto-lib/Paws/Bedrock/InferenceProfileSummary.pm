=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::InferenceProfileSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::InferenceProfileSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::InferenceProfileSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about an inference profile.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The time at which the inference profile was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the inference profile.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InferenceProfileArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the inference profile.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InferenceProfileId => Str

The unique identifier of the inference profile.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InferenceProfileName => Str

The name of the inference profile.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Models => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Bedrock::InferenceProfileModel>]

A list of information about each model in the inference profile.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

The status of the inference profile. C<ACTIVE> means that the inference
profile is ready to be used.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of the inference profile. The following types are possible:

=over

=item *

C<SYSTEM_DEFINED> E<ndash> The inference profile is defined by Amazon
Bedrock. You can route inference requests across regions with these
inference profiles.

=item *

C<APPLICATION> E<ndash> The inference profile was created by a user.
This type of inference profile can track metrics and costs when
invoking the model in it. The inference profile may route requests to
one or multiple regions.

=back



=head2 UpdatedAt => Str

The time at which the inference profile was last updated.
