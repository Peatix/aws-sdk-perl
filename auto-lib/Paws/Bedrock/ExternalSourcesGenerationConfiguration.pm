  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalModelRequestFields => $value, ..., PromptTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::ExternalSourcesGenerationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalModelRequestFields

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The response generation configuration of the external source wrapper
object.
