=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::CustomModelUnits

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::CustomModelUnits object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomModelUnitsPerModelCopy => $value, ..., CustomModelUnitsVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::CustomModelUnits object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomModelUnitsPerModelCopy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<CustomModelUnit> (CMU) is an abstract view of the hardware
utilization that Amazon Bedrock needs to host a single copy of your
custom model. A model copy represents a single instance of your
imported model that is ready to serve inference requests. Amazon
Bedrock determines the number of custom model units that a model copy
needs when you import the custom model.

You can use C<CustomModelUnits> to estimate the cost of running your
custom model. For more information, see Calculate the cost of running a
custom model in the Amazon Bedrock user guide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomModelUnitsPerModelCopy => Int

The number of custom model units used to host a model copy.


=head2 CustomModelUnitsVersion => Str

The version of the custom model unit. Use to determine the billing rate
for the custom model unit.
