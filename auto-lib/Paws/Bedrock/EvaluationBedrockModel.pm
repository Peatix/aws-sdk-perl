=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationBedrockModel

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationBedrockModel object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InferenceParams => $value, ..., PerformanceConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationBedrockModel object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InferenceParams

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the ARN of the Amazon Bedrock model or inference profile
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html)
specified in your evaluation job. Each Amazon Bedrock model supports
different C<inferenceParams>. To learn more about supported inference
parameters for Amazon Bedrock models, see Inference parameters for
foundation models
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters.html).

The C<inferenceParams> are specified using JSON. To successfully insert
JSON as string make sure that all quotations are properly escaped. For
example, C<"temperature":"0.25"> key value pair would need to be
formatted as C<\"temperature\":\"0.25\"> to successfully accepted in
the request.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InferenceParams => Str

how the model behaves during inference.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelIdentifier => Str

The ARN of the Amazon Bedrock model or inference profile specified.


=head2 PerformanceConfig => L<Paws::Bedrock::PerformanceConfiguration>

Specifies performance settings for the model or inference profile.
