=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationInferenceConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationInferenceConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Models => $value, ..., RagConfigs => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationInferenceConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Models

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration details of the inference model for an evaluation job.

For automated model evaluation jobs, only a single model is supported.

For human-based model evaluation jobs, your annotator can compare the
responses for up to two different models.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Models => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationModelConfig>]

Specifies the inference models.


=head2 RagConfigs => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Bedrock::RAGConfig>]

Contains the configuration details of the inference for a knowledge
base evaluation job, including either the retrieval only configuration
or the retrieval with response generation configuration.
