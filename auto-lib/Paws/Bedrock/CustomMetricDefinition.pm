=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::CustomMetricDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::CustomMetricDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Instructions => $value, ..., RatingScale => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::CustomMetricDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Instructions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The definition of a custom metric for use in an Amazon Bedrock
evaluation job. A custom metric definition includes a metric name,
prompt (instructions) and optionally, a rating scale. Your prompt must
include a task description and input variables. The required input
variables are different for model-as-a-judge and RAG evaluations.

For more information about how to define a custom metric in Amazon
Bedrock, see Create a prompt for a custom metrics (LLM-as-a-judge model
evaluations)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-evaluation-custom-metrics-prompt-formats.html)
and Create a prompt for a custom metrics (RAG evaluations)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/kb-evaluation-custom-metrics-prompt-formats.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Instructions => Str

The prompt for a custom metric that instructs the evaluator model how
to rate the model or RAG source under evaluation.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name for a custom metric. Names must be unique in your Amazon Web
Services region.


=head2 RatingScale => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Bedrock::RatingScaleItem>]

Defines the rating scale to be used for a custom metric. We recommend
that you always define a ratings scale when creating a custom metric.
If you don't define a scale, Amazon Bedrock won't be able to visually
display the results of the evaluation in the console or calculate
average values of numerical scores. For more information on specifying
a rating scale, see Specifying an output schema (rating scale)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-evaluation-custom-metrics-prompt-formats.html#model-evaluation-custom-metrics-prompt-formats-schema).
