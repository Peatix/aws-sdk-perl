=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::RequestMetadataFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::RequestMetadataFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AndAll => $value, ..., OrAll => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::RequestMetadataFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AndAll

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rules for filtering invocation logs. A filter can be a mapping of a
metadata key to a value that it should or should not equal (a base
filter), or a list of base filters that are all applied with C<AND> or
C<OR> logical operators

=head2 NotEquals => L<Paws::Bedrock::RequestMetadataMap>

Include results where the key does not equal the value.


=head2 OrAll => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Bedrock::RequestMetadataBaseFilters>]
