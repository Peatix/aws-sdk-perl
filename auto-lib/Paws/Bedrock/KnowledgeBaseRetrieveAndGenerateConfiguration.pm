=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::KnowledgeBaseRetrieveAndGenerateConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::KnowledgeBaseRetrieveAndGenerateConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GenerationConfiguration => $value, ..., RetrievalConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::KnowledgeBaseRetrieveAndGenerateConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GenerationConfiguration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configuration details for retrieving information from a
knowledge base and generating responses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GenerationConfiguration => L<Paws::Bedrock::GenerationConfiguration>

Contains configurations details for response generation based on
retrieved text chunks.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KnowledgeBaseId => Str

The unique identifier of the knowledge base.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelArn => Str

profile
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html)
used to generate responses.


=head2 OrchestrationConfiguration => L<Paws::Bedrock::OrchestrationConfiguration>

Contains configuration details for the model to process the prompt
prior to retrieval and response generation.


=head2 RetrievalConfiguration => L<Paws::Bedrock::KnowledgeBaseRetrievalConfiguration>

Contains configuration details for retrieving text chunks.
