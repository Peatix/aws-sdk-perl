=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::GenerationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::GenerationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalModelRequestFields => $value, ..., PromptTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::GenerationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalModelRequestFields

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration details for response generation based on retrieved
text chunks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalModelRequestFields => L<Paws::Bedrock::AdditionalModelRequestFields>

Additional model parameters and corresponding values not included in
the C<textInferenceConfig> structure for a knowledge base. This allows
you to provide custom model parameters specific to the language model
being used.


=head2 GuardrailConfiguration => L<Paws::Bedrock::GuardrailConfiguration>

Contains configuration details for the guardrail.


=head2 KbInferenceConfig => L<Paws::Bedrock::KbInferenceConfig>

Contains configuration details for inference for knowledge base
retrieval and response generation.


=head2 PromptTemplate => L<Paws::Bedrock::PromptTemplate>

Contains the template for the prompt that's sent to the model for
response generation.
