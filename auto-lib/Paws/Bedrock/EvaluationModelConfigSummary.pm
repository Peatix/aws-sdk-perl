=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationModelConfigSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationModelConfigSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BedrockModelIdentifiers => $value, ..., PrecomputedInferenceSourceIdentifiers => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::EvaluationModelConfigSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BedrockModelIdentifiers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of the models used in an Amazon Bedrock model evaluation job.
These resources can be models in Amazon Bedrock or models outside of
Amazon Bedrock that you use to generate your own inference response
data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BedrockModelIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the models used for the evaluation
job.


=head2 PrecomputedInferenceSourceIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A label that identifies the models used for a model evaluation job
where you provide your own inference response data.
