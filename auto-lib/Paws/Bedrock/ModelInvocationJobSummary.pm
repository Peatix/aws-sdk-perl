=head1 NAME

Paws::Bedrock::ModelInvocationJobSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Bedrock::ModelInvocationJobSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientRequestToken => $value, ..., VpcConfig => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Bedrock::ModelInvocationJobSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientRequestToken

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of a batch inference job.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientRequestToken => Str

A unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure that the API request
completes no more than one time. If this token matches a previous
request, Amazon Bedrock ignores the request, but does not return an
error. For more information, see Ensuring idempotency
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html).


=head2 EndTime => Str

The time at which the batch inference job ended.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InputDataConfig => L<Paws::Bedrock::ModelInvocationJobInputDataConfig>

Details about the location of the input to the batch inference job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch inference job.


=head2 JobExpirationTime => Str

The time at which the batch inference job times or timed out.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> JobName => Str

The name of the batch inference job.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The time at which the batch inference job was last modified.


=head2 Message => Str

If the batch inference job failed, this field contains a message
describing why the job failed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ModelId => Str

The unique identifier of the foundation model used for model inference.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OutputDataConfig => L<Paws::Bedrock::ModelInvocationJobOutputDataConfig>

Details about the location of the output of the batch inference job.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service role with permissions to
carry out and manage batch inference. You can use the console to create
a default service role or follow the steps at Create a service role for
batch inference
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-iam-sr.html).


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the batch inference job.

The following statuses are possible:

=over

=item *

Submitted E<ndash> This job has been submitted to a queue for
validation.

=item *

Validating E<ndash> This job is being validated for the requirements
described in Format and upload your batch inference data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-data.html).
The criteria include the following:

=over

=item *

Your IAM service role has access to the Amazon S3 buckets containing
your files.

=item *

Your files are .jsonl files and each individual record is a JSON object
in the correct format. Note that validation doesn't check if the
C<modelInput> value matches the request body for the model.

=item *

Your files fulfill the requirements for file size and number of
records. For more information, see Quotas for Amazon Bedrock
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html).

=back

=item *

Scheduled E<ndash> This job has been validated and is now in a queue.
The job will automatically start when it reaches its turn.

=item *

Expired E<ndash> This job timed out because it was scheduled but didn't
begin before the set timeout duration. Submit a new job request.

=item *

InProgress E<ndash> This job has begun. You can start viewing the
results in the output S3 location.

=item *

Completed E<ndash> This job has successfully completed. View the output
files in the output S3 location.

=item *

PartiallyCompleted E<ndash> This job has partially completed. Not all
of your records could be processed in time. View the output files in
the output S3 location.

=item *

Failed E<ndash> This job has failed. Check the failure message for any
further details. For further assistance, reach out to the Amazon Web
ServicesSupport Center (https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/).

=item *

Stopped E<ndash> This job was stopped by a user.

=item *

Stopping E<ndash> This job is being stopped by a user.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubmitTime => Str

The time at which the batch inference job was submitted.


=head2 TimeoutDurationInHours => Int

The number of hours after which the batch inference job was set to time
out.


=head2 VpcConfig => L<Paws::Bedrock::VpcConfig>

The configuration of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for the data in
the batch inference job. For more information, see Protect batch
inference jobs using a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-vpc).
