=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityArn => $value, ..., ServerCertificates => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configures the Certificate Manager certificates and scope that Network
Firewall uses to decrypt and re-encrypt traffic using a
TLSInspectionConfiguration. You can configure C<ServerCertificates> for
inbound SSL/TLS inspection, a C<CertificateAuthorityArn> for outbound
SSL/TLS inspection, or both. For information about working with
certificates for TLS inspection, see Using SSL/TLS server certficiates
with TLS inspection configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection-certificate-requirements.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.

If a server certificate that's associated with your
TLSInspectionConfiguration is revoked, deleted, or expired it can
result in client-side TLS errors.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateAuthorityArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate authority
(CA) certificate within Certificate Manager (ACM) to use for outbound
SSL/TLS inspection.

The following limitations apply:

=over

=item *

You can use CA certificates that you imported into ACM, but you can't
generate CA certificates with ACM.

=item *

You can't use certificates issued by Private Certificate Authority.

=back

For more information about configuring certificates for outbound
inspection, see Using SSL/TLS certificates with certificates with TLS
inspection configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection-certificate-requirements.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.

For information about working with certificates in ACM, see Importing
certificates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html)
in the I<Certificate Manager User Guide>.


=head2 CheckCertificateRevocationStatus => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::CheckCertificateRevocationStatusActions>

When enabled, Network Firewall checks if the server certificate
presented by the server in the SSL/TLS connection has a revoked or
unkown status. If the certificate has an unknown or revoked status, you
must specify the actions that Network Firewall takes on outbound
traffic. To check the certificate revocation status, you must also
specify a C<CertificateAuthorityArn> in ServerCertificateConfiguration.


=head2 Scopes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateScope>]

A list of scopes.


=head2 ServerCertificates => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificate>]

The list of server certificates to use for inbound SSL/TLS inspection.
