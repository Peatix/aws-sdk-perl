=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RuleVariables => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::IPSets>

The IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation to use for the Suricata
C<HOME_NET> variable. If your firewall uses an inspection VPC, you
might want to override the C<HOME_NET> variable with the CIDRs of your
home networks. If you don't override C<HOME_NET> with your own CIDRs,
Network Firewall by default uses the CIDR of your inspection VPC.
