=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroupResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroupResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnalysisResults => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::RuleGroupResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnalysisResults

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The high-level properties of a rule group. This, along with the
RuleGroup, define the rule group. You can retrieve all objects for a
rule group by calling DescribeRuleGroup.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnalysisResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisResult>]

The list of analysis results for C<AnalyzeRuleGroup>. If you set
C<AnalyzeRuleGroup> to C<TRUE> in CreateRuleGroup, UpdateRuleGroup, or
DescribeRuleGroup, Network Firewall analyzes the rule group and
identifies the rules that might adversely effect your firewall's
functionality. For example, if Network Firewall detects a rule that's
routing traffic asymmetrically, which impacts the service's ability to
properly process traffic, the service includes the rule in the list of
analysis results.


=head2 Capacity => Int

The maximum operating resources that this rule group can use. Rule
group capacity is fixed at creation. When you update a rule group, you
are limited to this capacity. When you reference a rule group from a
firewall policy, Network Firewall reserves this capacity for the rule
group.

You can retrieve the capacity that would be required for a rule group
before you create the rule group by calling CreateRuleGroup with
C<DryRun> set to C<TRUE>.


=head2 ConsumedCapacity => Int

The number of capacity units currently consumed by the rule group
rules.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the rule group.


=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::EncryptionConfiguration>

A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryption
configuration settings for your rule group.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The last time that the rule group was changed.


=head2 NumberOfAssociations => Int

The number of firewall policies that use this rule group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

If this response is for a create request that had C<DryRun> set to
C<TRUE>, then this ARN is a placeholder that isn't attached to a valid
resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleGroupId => Str

The unique identifier for the rule group.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleGroupName => Str

The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
rule group after you create it.


=head2 RuleGroupStatus => Str

Detailed information about the current status of a rule group.


=head2 SnsTopic => Str

The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
Service SNS topic that's used to record changes to the managed rule
group. You can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive notifications when
the managed rule group is modified, such as for new versions and for
version expiration. For more information, see the Amazon Simple
Notification Service Developer Guide.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html).


=head2 SourceMetadata => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::SourceMetadata>

A complex type that contains metadata about the rule group that your
own rule group is copied from. You can use the metadata to track the
version updates made to the originating rule group.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Tag>]

The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.


=head2 Type => Str

Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule
group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it
contains stateful rules.
