=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::DescribeRuleGroup - Arguments for method DescribeRuleGroup on L<Paws::NetworkFirewall>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeRuleGroup on the
L<AWS Network Firewall|Paws::NetworkFirewall> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeRuleGroup.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeRuleGroup.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $network-firewall = Paws->service('NetworkFirewall');
    my $DescribeRuleGroupResponse = $network -firewall->DescribeRuleGroup(
      AnalyzeRuleGroup => 1,                   # OPTIONAL
      RuleGroupArn     => 'MyResourceArn',     # OPTIONAL
      RuleGroupName    => 'MyResourceName',    # OPTIONAL
      Type             => 'STATELESS',         # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $RuleGroup         = $DescribeRuleGroupResponse->RuleGroup;
    my $RuleGroupResponse = $DescribeRuleGroupResponse->RuleGroupResponse;
    my $UpdateToken       = $DescribeRuleGroupResponse->UpdateToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::DescribeRuleGroupResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/network-firewall/DescribeRuleGroup>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnalyzeRuleGroup => Bool

Indicates whether you want Network Firewall to analyze the stateless
rules in the rule group for rule behavior such as asymmetric routing.
If set to C<TRUE>, Network Firewall runs the analysis.



=head2 RuleGroupArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule group.

You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.



=head2 RuleGroupName => Str

The descriptive name of the rule group. You can't change the name of a
rule group after you create it.

You must specify the ARN or the name, and you can specify both.



=head2 Type => Str

Indicates whether the rule group is stateless or stateful. If the rule
group is stateless, it contains stateless rules. If it is stateful, it
contains stateful rules.

This setting is required for requests that do not include the
C<RuleGroupARN>.

Valid values are: C<"STATELESS">, C<"STATEFUL">
