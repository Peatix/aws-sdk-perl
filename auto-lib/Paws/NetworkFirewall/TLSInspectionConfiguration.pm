=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ServerCertificateConfigurations => $value, ..., ServerCertificateConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ServerCertificateConfigurations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The object that defines a TLS inspection configuration. This, along
with TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse, define the TLS inspection
configuration. You can retrieve all objects for a TLS inspection
configuration by calling DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration.

Network Firewall uses a TLS inspection configuration to decrypt
traffic. Network Firewall re-encrypts the traffic before sending it to
its destination.

To use a TLS inspection configuration, you add it to a new Network
Firewall firewall policy, then you apply the firewall policy to a
firewall. Network Firewall acts as a proxy service to decrypt and
inspect the traffic traveling through your firewalls. You can reference
a TLS inspection configuration from more than one firewall policy, and
you can use a firewall policy in more than one firewall. For more
information about using TLS inspection configurations, see Inspecting
SSL/TLS traffic with TLS inspection configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ServerCertificateConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateConfiguration>]
