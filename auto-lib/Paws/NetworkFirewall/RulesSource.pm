=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::RulesSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::RulesSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RulesSourceList => $value, ..., StatelessRulesAndCustomActions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::RulesSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RulesSourceList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The stateless or stateful rules definitions for use in a single rule
group. Each rule group requires a single C<RulesSource>. You can use an
instance of this for either stateless rules or stateful rules.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RulesSourceList => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::RulesSourceList>

Stateful inspection criteria for a domain list rule group.


=head2 RulesString => Str

Stateful inspection criteria, provided in Suricata compatible rules.
Suricata is an open-source threat detection framework that includes a
standard rule-based language for network traffic inspection.

These rules contain the inspection criteria and the action to take for
traffic that matches the criteria, so this type of rule group doesn't
have a separate action setting.

You can't use the C<priority> keyword if the C<RuleOrder> option in
StatefulRuleOptions is set to C<STRICT_ORDER>.


=head2 StatefulRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRule>]

An array of individual stateful rules inspection criteria to be used
together in a stateful rule group. Use this option to specify simple
Suricata rules with protocol, source and destination, ports, direction,
and rule options. For information about the Suricata C<Rules> format,
see Rules Format
(https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-7.0.3/rules/intro.html).


=head2 StatelessRulesAndCustomActions => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatelessRulesAndCustomActions>

Stateless inspection criteria to be used in a stateless rule group.
