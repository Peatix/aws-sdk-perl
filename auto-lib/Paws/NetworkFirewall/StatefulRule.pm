=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Action => $value, ..., RuleOptions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single Suricata rules specification, for use in a stateful rule
group. Use this option to specify a simple Suricata rule with protocol,
source and destination, ports, direction, and rule options. For
information about the Suricata C<Rules> format, see Rules Format
(https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-7.0.3/rules/intro.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Action => Str

Defines what Network Firewall should do with the packets in a traffic
flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions,
Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues
stateful inspection of the traffic flow.

The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows:

=over

=item *

B<PASS> - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination.

=item *

B<DROP> - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination and
sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in the
Firewall LoggingConfiguration.

=item *

B<ALERT> - Sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured
in the Firewall LoggingConfiguration.

You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to drop
traffic. You can enable the rule with C<ALERT> action, verify in the
logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the action to
C<DROP>.

=item *

B<REJECT> - Drops traffic that matches the conditions of the stateful
rule, and sends a TCP reset packet back to sender of the packet. A TCP
reset packet is a packet with no payload and an RST bit contained in
the TCP header flags. REJECT is available only for TCP traffic. This
option doesn't support FTP or IMAP protocols.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Header => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Header>

The stateful inspection criteria for this rule, used to inspect traffic
flows.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleOptions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::RuleOption>]

Additional options for the rule. These are the Suricata C<RuleOptions>
settings.
