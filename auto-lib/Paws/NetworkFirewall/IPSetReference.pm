=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::IPSetReference object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReferenceArn => $value, ..., ReferenceArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::IPSetReference object:

  $result->Att1->ReferenceArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configures one or more IP set references for a Suricata-compatible rule
group. This is used in CreateRuleGroup or UpdateRuleGroup. An IP set
reference is a rule variable that references resources that you create
and manage in another Amazon Web Services service, such as an Amazon
VPC prefix list. Network Firewall IP set references enable you to
dynamically update the contents of your rules. When you create, update,
or delete the resource you are referencing in your rule, Network
Firewall automatically updates the rule's content with the changes. For
more information about IP set references in Network Firewall, see Using
IP set references
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/rule-groups-ip-set-references)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.

Network Firewall currently supports Amazon VPC prefix lists
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/managed-prefix-lists.html)
and resource groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/rule-groups-ip-set-references.html#rule-groups-referencing-resource-groups)
in IP set references.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReferenceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource that you are referencing
in your rule group.
