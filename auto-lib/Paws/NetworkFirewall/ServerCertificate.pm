Any Certificate Manager (ACM) Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer
Security (SSL/TLS) server certificate that's associated with a
ServerCertificateConfiguration. Used in a TLSInspectionConfiguration

firewall. For information about working with certificates in
Certificate Manager, see Request a public certificate
