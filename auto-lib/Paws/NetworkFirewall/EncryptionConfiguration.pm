=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KeyId => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::EncryptionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A complex type that contains optional Amazon Web Services Key
Management Service (KMS) encryption settings for your Network Firewall
resources. Your data is encrypted by default with an Amazon Web
Services owned key that Amazon Web Services owns and manages for you.
You can use either the Amazon Web Services owned key, or provide your
own customer managed key. To learn more about KMS encryption of your
Network Firewall resources, see Encryption at rest with Amazon Web
Services Key Managment Service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-encryption-at-rest.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KeyId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) customer
managed key. You can use any of the key identifiers that KMS supports,
unless you're using a key that's managed by another account. If you're
using a key managed by another account, then specify the key ARN. For
more information, see Key ID
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#key-id)
in the I<Amazon Web Services KMS Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services KMS key to use for encryption of your
Network Firewall resources.
