=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FlowFilters => $value, ..., MinimumFlowAgeInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FlowFilters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a flow operation, such as related statuses,
unique identifiers, and all filters defined in the operation.

Flow operations let you manage the flows tracked in the flow table,
also known as the firewall table.

A flow is network traffic that is monitored by a firewall, either by
stateful or stateless rules. For traffic to be considered part of a
flow, it must share Destination, DestinationPort, Direction, Protocol,
Source, and SourcePort.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FlowFilters => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowFilter>]

Defines the scope a flow operation. You can use up to 20 filters to
configure a single flow operation.


=head2 MinimumFlowAgeInSeconds => Int

The reqested C<FlowOperation> ignores flows with an age (in seconds)
lower than C<MinimumFlowAgeInSeconds>. You provide this for start
commands.
