=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::Flow

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::Flow object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Age => $value, ..., SourcePort => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::Flow object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Age

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Any number of arrays, where each array is a single flow identified in
the scope of the operation. If multiple flows were in the scope of the
operation, multiple C<Flows> arrays are returned.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Age => Int

Returned as info about age of the flows identified by the flow
operation.


=head2 ByteCount => Int

Returns the number of bytes received or transmitted in a specific flow.


=head2 DestinationAddress => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>




=head2 DestinationPort => Str

The destination port to inspect for. You can specify an individual
port, for example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.


=head2 PacketCount => Int

Returns the total number of data packets received or transmitted in a
flow.


=head2 Protocol => Str

The protocols to inspect for, specified using the assigned internet
protocol number (IANA) for each protocol. If not specified, this
matches with any protocol.


=head2 SourceAddress => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>




=head2 SourcePort => Str

The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for
example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.
