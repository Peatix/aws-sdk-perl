=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationAddress => $value, ..., SourcePort => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationAddress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the scope a flow operation. You can use up to 20 filters to
configure a single flow operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DestinationAddress => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>




=head2 DestinationPort => Str

The destination port to inspect for. You can specify an individual
port, for example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.


=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The protocols to inspect for, specified using the assigned internet
protocol number (IANA) for each protocol. If not specified, this
matches with any protocol.


=head2 SourceAddress => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>




=head2 SourcePort => Str

The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for
example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.
