=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::CheckCertificateRevocationStatusActions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::CheckCertificateRevocationStatusActions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RevokedStatusAction => $value, ..., UnknownStatusAction => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::CheckCertificateRevocationStatusActions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RevokedStatusAction

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the actions to take on the SSL/TLS connection if the
certificate presented by the server in the connection has a revoked or
unknown status.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RevokedStatusAction => Str

Configures how Network Firewall processes traffic when it determines
that the certificate presented by the server in the SSL/TLS connection
has a revoked status.

=over

=item *

B<PASS> - Allow the connection to continue, and pass subsequent packets
to the stateful engine for inspection.

=item *

B<DROP> - Network Firewall closes the connection and drops subsequent
packets for that connection.

=item *

B<REJECT> - Network Firewall sends a TCP reject packet back to your
client. The service closes the connection and drops subsequent packets
for that connection. C<REJECT> is available only for TCP traffic.

=back



=head2 UnknownStatusAction => Str

Configures how Network Firewall processes traffic when it determines
that the certificate presented by the server in the SSL/TLS connection
has an unknown status, or a status that cannot be determined for any
other reason, including when the service is unable to connect to the
OCSP and CRL endpoints for the certificate.

=over

=item *

B<PASS> - Allow the connection to continue, and pass subsequent packets
to the stateful engine for inspection.

=item *

B<DROP> - Network Firewall closes the connection and drops subsequent
packets for that connection.
