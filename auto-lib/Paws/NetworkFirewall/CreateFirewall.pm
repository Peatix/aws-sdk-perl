=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::CreateFirewall - Arguments for method CreateFirewall on L<Paws::NetworkFirewall>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateFirewall on the
L<AWS Network Firewall|Paws::NetworkFirewall> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateFirewall.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateFirewall.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $network-firewall = Paws->service('NetworkFirewall');
    my $CreateFirewallResponse = $network -firewall->CreateFirewall(
      FirewallName         => 'MyResourceName',
      FirewallPolicyArn    => 'MyResourceArn',
      DeleteProtection     => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      Description          => 'MyDescription',    # OPTIONAL
      EnabledAnalysisTypes => [
        'TLS_SNI', ...                            # values: TLS_SNI, HTTP_HOST
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      EncryptionConfiguration => {
        Type  => 'CUSTOMER_KMS',    # values: CUSTOMER_KMS, AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY
        KeyId => 'MyKeyId',         # min: 1, max: 2048; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      FirewallPolicyChangeProtection => 1,    # OPTIONAL
      SubnetChangeProtection         => 1,    # OPTIONAL
      SubnetMappings                 => [
        {
          SubnetId      => 'MyCollectionMember_String',
          IPAddressType =>
            'DUALSTACK',    # values: DUALSTACK, IPV4, IPV6; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      VpcId => 'MyVpcId',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Firewall       = $CreateFirewallResponse->Firewall;
    my $FirewallStatus = $CreateFirewallResponse->FirewallStatus;

    # Returns a L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::CreateFirewallResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteProtection => Bool

A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall. A
setting of C<TRUE> indicates that the firewall is protected against
deletion. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting a
firewall that is in use. When you create a firewall, the operation
initializes this flag to C<TRUE>.



=head2 Description => Str

A description of the firewall.



=head2 EnabledAnalysisTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An optional setting indicating the specific traffic analysis types to
enable on the firewall.



=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::EncryptionConfiguration>

A complex type that contains settings for encryption of your firewall
resources.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirewallName => Str

The descriptive name of the firewall. You can't change the name of a
firewall after you create it.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FirewallPolicyArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FirewallPolicy that you want to
use for the firewall.



=head2 FirewallPolicyChangeProtection => Bool

A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a change
to the firewall policy association. Use this setting to protect against
accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a firewall that is in
use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this setting
to C<TRUE>.



=head2 SubnetChangeProtection => Bool

A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against changes
to the subnet associations. Use this setting to protect against
accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a firewall that is
in use. When you create a firewall, the operation initializes this
setting to C<TRUE>.



=head2 SubnetMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::SubnetMapping>]

The public subnets to use for your Network Firewall firewalls. Each
subnet must belong to a different Availability Zone in the VPC. Network
Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Tag>]

The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.



=head2 VpcId => Str

The unique identifier of the VPC where Network Firewall should create
the firewall.

You can't change this setting after you create the firewall.
