=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::MatchAttributes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::MatchAttributes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationPorts => $value, ..., TCPFlags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::MatchAttributes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationPorts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Criteria for Network Firewall to use to inspect an individual packet in
stateless rule inspection. Each match attributes set can include one or
more items such as IP address, CIDR range, port number, protocol, and
TCP flags.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DestinationPorts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::PortRange>]

The destination port to inspect for. You can specify an individual
port, for example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.

This setting is only used for protocols 6 (TCP) and 17 (UDP).


=head2 Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>]

The destination IP addresses and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR
notation. If not specified, this matches with any destination address.


=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Int]

The protocols to inspect for, specified using the assigned internet
protocol number (IANA) for each protocol. If not specified, this
matches with any protocol.


=head2 SourcePorts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::PortRange>]

The source port to inspect for. You can specify an individual port, for
example C<1994> and you can specify a port range, for example
C<1990:1994>. To match with any port, specify C<ANY>.

If not specified, this matches with any source port.

This setting is only used for protocols 6 (TCP) and 17 (UDP).


=head2 Sources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>]

The source IP addresses and address ranges to inspect for, in CIDR
notation. If not specified, this matches with any source address.


=head2 TCPFlags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::TCPFlagField>]

The TCP flags and masks to inspect for. If not specified, this matches
with any settings. This setting is only used for protocol 6 (TCP).
