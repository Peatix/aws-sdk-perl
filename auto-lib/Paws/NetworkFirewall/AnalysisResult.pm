=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnalysisDetail => $value, ..., IdentifiedType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnalysisDetail

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The analysis result for Network Firewall's stateless rule group
analyzer. Every time you call CreateRuleGroup, UpdateRuleGroup, or
DescribeRuleGroup on a stateless rule group, Network Firewall analyzes
the stateless rule groups in your account and identifies the rules that
might adversely effect your firewall's functionality. For example, if
Network Firewall detects a rule that's routing traffic asymmetrically,
which impacts the service's ability to properly process traffic, the
service includes the rule in a list of analysis results.

The C<AnalysisResult> data type is not related to traffic analysis
reports you generate using StartAnalysisReport. For information on
traffic analysis report results, see AnalysisTypeReportResult.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnalysisDetail => Str

Provides analysis details for the identified rule.


=head2 IdentifiedRuleIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The priority number of the stateless rules identified in the analysis.


=head2 IdentifiedType => Str

The types of rule configurations that Network Firewall analyzes your
rule groups for. Network Firewall analyzes stateless rule groups for
the following types of rule configurations:

=over

=item *

C<STATELESS_RULE_FORWARDING_ASYMMETRICALLY>

Cause: One or more stateless rules with the action C<pass> or
C<forward> are forwarding traffic asymmetrically. Specifically, the
rule's set of source IP addresses or their associated port numbers,
don't match the set of destination IP addresses or their associated
port numbers.

To mitigate: Make sure that there's an existing return path. For
example, if the rule allows traffic from source 10.1.0.0/24 to
destination 20.1.0.0/24, you should allow return traffic from source
20.1.0.0/24 to destination 10.1.0.0/24.

=item *

C<STATELESS_RULE_CONTAINS_TCP_FLAGS>

Cause: At least one stateless rule with the action C<pass> orC<forward>
contains TCP flags that are inconsistent in the forward and return
directions.

To mitigate: Prevent asymmetric routing issues caused by TCP flags by
following these actions:

=over

=item *

Remove unnecessary TCP flag inspections from the rules.

=item *

If you need to inspect TCP flags, check that the rules correctly
account for changes in TCP flags throughout the TCP connection cycle,
for example C<SYN> and C<ACK> flags used in a 3-way TCP handshake.
