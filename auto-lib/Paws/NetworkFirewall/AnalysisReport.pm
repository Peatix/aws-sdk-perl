=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisReport

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisReport object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnalysisReportId => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::AnalysisReport object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnalysisReportId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A report that captures key activity from the last 30 days of network
traffic monitored by your firewall.

You can generate up to one report per traffic type, per 30 day period.
For example, when you successfully create an HTTP traffic report, you
cannot create another HTTP traffic report until 30 days pass.
Alternatively, if you generate a report that combines metrics on both
HTTP and HTTPS traffic, you cannot create another report for either
traffic type until 30 days pass.
