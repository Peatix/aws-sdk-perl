=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateScope

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateScope object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DestinationPorts => $value, ..., Sources => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::ServerCertificateScope object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DestinationPorts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Settings that define the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
(SSL/TLS) traffic that Network Firewall should decrypt for inspection
by the stateful rule engine.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DestinationPorts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::PortRange>]

The destination ports to decrypt for inspection, in Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) format. If not specified, this matches with any
destination port.

You can specify individual ports, for example C<1994>, and you can
specify port ranges, such as C<1990:1994>.


=head2 Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>]

The destination IP addresses and address ranges to decrypt for
inspection, in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any
destination address.


=head2 Protocols => ArrayRef[Int]

The protocols to inspect for, specified using the assigned internet
protocol number (IANA) for each protocol. If not specified, this
matches with any protocol.

Network Firewall currently supports only TCP.


=head2 SourcePorts => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::PortRange>]

The source ports to decrypt for inspection, in Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) format. If not specified, this matches with any source
port.

You can specify individual ports, for example C<1994>, and you can
specify port ranges, such as C<1990:1994>.


=head2 Sources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Address>]

The source IP addresses and address ranges to decrypt for inspection,
in CIDR notation. If not specified, this matches with any source
address.
