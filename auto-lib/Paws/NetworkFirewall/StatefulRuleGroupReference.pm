=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleGroupReference

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleGroupReference object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Override => $value, ..., ResourceArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleGroupReference object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Override

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Identifier for a single stateful rule group, used in a firewall policy
to refer to a rule group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Override => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleGroupOverride>

The action that allows the policy owner to override the behavior of the
rule group within a policy.


=head2 Priority => Int

An integer setting that indicates the order in which to run the
stateful rule groups in a single FirewallPolicy. This setting only
applies to firewall policies that specify the C<STRICT_ORDER> rule
order in the stateful engine options settings.

Network Firewall evalutes each stateful rule group against a packet
starting with the group that has the lowest priority setting. You must
ensure that the priority settings are unique within each policy.

You can change the priority settings of your rule groups at any time.
To make it easier to insert rule groups later, number them so there's a
wide range in between, for example use 100, 200, and so on.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stateful rule group.
