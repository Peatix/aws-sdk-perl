=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowTimeouts

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowTimeouts object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TcpIdleTimeoutSeconds => $value, ..., TcpIdleTimeoutSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowTimeouts object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TcpIdleTimeoutSeconds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the amount of time that can pass without any traffic sent
through the firewall before the firewall determines that the connection
is idle and Network Firewall removes the flow entry from its flow
table. Existing connections and flows are not impacted when you update
this value. Only new connections after you update this value are
impacted.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 TcpIdleTimeoutSeconds => Int

The number of seconds that can pass without any TCP traffic sent
through the firewall before the firewall determines that the connection
is idle. After the idle timeout passes, data packets are dropped,
however, the next TCP SYN packet is considered a new flow and is
processed by the firewall. Clients or targets can use TCP keepalive
packets to reset the idle timeout.

You can define the C<TcpIdleTimeoutSeconds> value to be between 60 and
6000 seconds. If no value is provided, it defaults to 350 seconds.
