=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::LogDestinationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::LogDestinationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LogDestination => $value, ..., LogType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::LogDestinationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LogDestination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines where Network Firewall sends logs for the firewall for one log
type. This is used in LoggingConfiguration. You can send each type of
log to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log group, or a Firehose
delivery stream.

Network Firewall generates logs for stateful rule groups. You can save
alert, flow, and TLS log types.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogDestination => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::LogDestinationMap>

The named location for the logs, provided in a key:value mapping that
is specific to the chosen destination type.

=over

=item *

For an Amazon S3 bucket, provide the name of the bucket, with key
C<bucketName>, and optionally provide a prefix, with key C<prefix>.

The following example specifies an Amazon S3 bucket named
C<DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET> and the prefix C<alerts>:

C<"LogDestination": { "bucketName": "DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET", "prefix":
"alerts" }>

=item *

For a CloudWatch log group, provide the name of the CloudWatch log
group, with key C<logGroup>. The following example specifies a log
group named C<alert-log-group>:

C<"LogDestination": { "logGroup": "alert-log-group" }>

=item *

For a Firehose delivery stream, provide the name of the delivery
stream, with key C<deliveryStream>. The following example specifies a
delivery stream named C<alert-delivery-stream>:

C<"LogDestination": { "deliveryStream": "alert-delivery-stream" }>

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogDestinationType => Str

The type of storage destination to send these logs to. You can send
logs to an Amazon S3 bucket, a CloudWatch log group, or a Firehose
delivery stream.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LogType => Str

The type of log to record. You can record the following types of logs
from your Network Firewall stateful engine.

=over

=item *

C<ALERT> - Logs for traffic that matches your stateful rules and that
have an action that sends an alert. A stateful rule sends alerts for
the rule actions DROP, ALERT, and REJECT. For more information, see
StatefulRule.

=item *

C<FLOW> - Standard network traffic flow logs. The stateful rules engine
records flow logs for all network traffic that it receives. Each flow
log record captures the network flow for a specific standard stateless
rule group.

=item *

C<TLS> - Logs for events that are related to TLS inspection. For more
information, see Inspecting SSL/TLS traffic with TLS inspection
configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection-configurations.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.
