=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperationMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperationMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FlowOperationId => $value, ..., FlowRequestTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::FlowOperationMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FlowOperationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An array of objects with metadata about the requested C<FlowOperation>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FlowOperationId => Str

A unique identifier for the flow operation. This ID is returned in the

=head2 FlowOperationStatus => Str

Returns the status of the flow operation. This string is returned in
the responses to start, list, and describe commands.

If the status is C<COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS>, results may be returned with
