Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RuleOrder => $value, ..., RuleOrder => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::StatefulRuleOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RuleOrder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additional options governing how Network Firewall handles the rule
group. You can only use these for stateful rule groups.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RuleOrder => Str

Indicates how to manage the order of the rule evaluation for the rule
group. C<DEFAULT_ACTION_ORDER> is the default behavior. Stateful rules
are provided to the rule engine as Suricata compatible strings, and
Suricata evaluates them based on certain settings. For more
information, see Evaluation order for stateful rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/suricata-rule-evaluation-order.html)
in the I<Network Firewall Developer Guide>.
