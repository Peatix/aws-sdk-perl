=head1 NAME

Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthority => $value, ..., TLSInspectionConfigurationStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::NetworkFirewall::TLSInspectionConfigurationResponse object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthority

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The high-level properties of a TLS inspection configuration. This,
along with the C<TLSInspectionConfiguration>, define the TLS inspection
configuration. You can retrieve all objects for a TLS inspection
configuration by calling C<DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateAuthority => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::TlsCertificateData>




=head2 Certificates => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::TlsCertificateData>]

A list of the certificates associated with the TLS inspection
configuration.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the TLS inspection configuration.


=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::EncryptionConfiguration>

A complex type that contains the Amazon Web Services KMS encryption
configuration settings for your TLS inspection configuration.


=head2 LastModifiedTime => Str

The last time that the TLS inspection configuration was changed.


=head2 NumberOfAssociations => Int

The number of firewall policies that use this TLS inspection
configuration.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::NetworkFirewall::Tag>]

The key:value pairs to associate with the resource.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TLSInspectionConfigurationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the TLS inspection configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TLSInspectionConfigurationId => Str

A unique identifier for the TLS inspection configuration. This ID is
returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it
to operations such as update and delete.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TLSInspectionConfigurationName => Str

The descriptive name of the TLS inspection configuration. You can't
change the name of a TLS inspection configuration after you create it.


=head2 TLSInspectionConfigurationStatus => Str

Detailed information about the current status of a
TLSInspectionConfiguration. You can retrieve this for a TLS inspection
configuration by calling DescribeTLSInspectionConfiguration and
providing the TLS inspection configuration name and ARN.
