=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::S3JobManifestGenerator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::S3JobManifestGenerator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableManifestOutput => $value, ..., SourceBucket => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::S3JobManifestGenerator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableManifestOutput

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The container for the service that will create the S3 manifest.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableManifestOutput => Bool

Determines whether or not to write the job's generated manifest to a
bucket.


=head2 ExpectedBucketOwner => Str

The Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the bucket the generated
manifest is written to. If provided the generated manifest bucket's
owner Amazon Web Services account ID must match this value, else the
job fails.


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::S3Control::JobManifestGeneratorFilter>

Specifies rules the S3JobManifestGenerator should use to decide whether
an object in the source bucket should or should not be included in the
generated job manifest.


=head2 ManifestOutputLocation => L<Paws::S3Control::S3ManifestOutputLocation>

Specifies the location the generated manifest will be written to.
Manifests can't be written to directory buckets. For more information,
see Directory buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceBucket => Str

The ARN of the source bucket used by the ManifestGenerator.

B<Directory buckets> - Directory buckets aren't supported as the source
buckets used by C<S3JobManifestGenerator> to generate the job manifest.
