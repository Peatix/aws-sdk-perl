=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::ObjectLambdaConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::ObjectLambdaConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedFeatures => $value, ..., TransformationConfigurations => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::ObjectLambdaConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedFeatures

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A configuration used when creating an Object Lambda Access Point.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedFeatures => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A container for allowed features. Valid inputs are C<GetObject-Range>,
C<GetObject-PartNumber>, C<HeadObject-Range>, and
C<HeadObject-PartNumber>.


=head2 CloudWatchMetricsEnabled => Bool

A container for whether the CloudWatch metrics configuration is
enabled.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SupportingAccessPoint => Str

Standard access point associated with the Object Lambda Access Point.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TransformationConfigurations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::ObjectLambdaTransformationConfiguration>]

A container for transformation configurations for an Object Lambda
Access Point.
