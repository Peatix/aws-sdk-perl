=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRuleFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRuleFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { And => $value, ..., Tag => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRuleFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->And

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication
rule applies. A C<Filter> element must specify exactly one C<Prefix>,
C<Tag>, or C<And> child element.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 And => L<Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRuleAndOperator>

A container for specifying rule filters. The filters determine the
subset of objects that the rule applies to. This element is required
only if you specify more than one filter. For example:

=over

=item *

If you specify both a C<Prefix> and a C<Tag> filter, wrap these filters
in an C<And> element.

=item *

If you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the C<Tag>
elements in an C<And> element.

=back



=head2 Prefix => Str

An object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects that
the rule applies to.

When you're using XML requests, you must replace special characters
(such as carriage returns) in object keys with their equivalent XML
entity codes. For more information, see XML-related object key
constraints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 Tag => L<Paws::S3Control::S3Tag>
