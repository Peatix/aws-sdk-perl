=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointReport

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointReport object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Alias => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointReport object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Alias

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of statuses for a Multi-Region Access Point in the various
Regions it supports.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Alias => Str

The alias for the Multi-Region Access Point. For more information about
the distinction between the name and the alias of an Multi-Region
Access Point, see Rules for naming Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CreatingMultiRegionAccessPoints.html#multi-region-access-point-naming).


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

When the Multi-Region Access Point create request was received.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the Multi-Region Access Point.


=head2 PublicAccessBlock => L<Paws::S3Control::PublicAccessBlockConfiguration>




=head2 Regions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::RegionReport>]

A collection of the Regions and buckets associated with the
Multi-Region Access Point.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the Multi-Region Access Point.

C<CREATING> and C<DELETING> are temporary states that exist while the
request is propagating and being completed. If a Multi-Region Access
Point has a status of C<PARTIALLY_CREATED>, you can retry creation or
send a request to delete the Multi-Region Access Point. If a
Multi-Region Access Point has a status of C<PARTIALLY_DELETED>, you can
retry a delete request to finish the deletion of the Multi-Region
Access Point.
