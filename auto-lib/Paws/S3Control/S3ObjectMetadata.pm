=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::S3ObjectMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::S3ObjectMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CacheControl => $value, ..., UserMetadata => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::S3ObjectMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CacheControl

=head2 SSEAlgorithm => Str

The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing objects in
Amazon S3.

B<Directory buckets > - For directory buckets, there are only two
supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption
with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (C<AES256>) and server-side
encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (C<KMS>). For more information, see
Protecting data with server-side encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-express-serv-side-encryption.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>. For the Copy operation in Batch
Operations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops),
see S3CopyObjectOperation
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_S3CopyObjectOperation.html).
