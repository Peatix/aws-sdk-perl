=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::CreateBucket - Arguments for method CreateBucket on L<Paws::S3Control>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateBucket on the
L<AWS S3 Control|Paws::S3Control> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateBucket.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateBucket.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $s3-control = Paws->service('S3Control');
    my $CreateBucketResult = $s3 -control->CreateBucket(
      Bucket                    => 'MyBucketName',
      ACL                       => 'private',        # OPTIONAL
      CreateBucketConfiguration => {
        LocationConstraint => 'EU'
        , # values: EU, eu-west-1, us-west-1, us-west-2, ap-south-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-northeast-1, sa-east-1, cn-north-1, eu-central-1; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      GrantFullControl           => 'MyGrantFullControl',             # OPTIONAL
      GrantRead                  => 'MyGrantRead',                    # OPTIONAL
      GrantReadACP               => 'MyGrantReadACP',                 # OPTIONAL
      GrantWrite                 => 'MyGrantWrite',                   # OPTIONAL
      GrantWriteACP              => 'MyGrantWriteACP',                # OPTIONAL
      ObjectLockEnabledForBucket => 1,                                # OPTIONAL
      OutpostId                  => 'MyNonEmptyMaxLength64String',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $BucketArn = $CreateBucketResult->BucketArn;
    my $Location  = $CreateBucketResult->Location;

    # Returns a L<Paws::S3Control::CreateBucketResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
