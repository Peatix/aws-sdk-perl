=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::JobManifestGeneratorFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::JobManifestGeneratorFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAfter => $value, ..., ObjectSizeLessThanBytes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::JobManifestGeneratorFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAfter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The filter used to describe a set of objects for the job's manifest.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreatedAfter => Str

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
that were created after this time.


=head2 CreatedBefore => Str

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
that were created before this time.


=head2 EligibleForReplication => Bool

Include objects in the generated manifest only if they are eligible for
replication according to the Replication configuration on the source
bucket.


=head2 KeyNameConstraint => L<Paws::S3Control::KeyNameConstraint>

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
whose object keys match the string constraints specified for
C<MatchAnyPrefix>, C<MatchAnySuffix>, and C<MatchAnySubstring>.


=head2 MatchAnyStorageClass => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
that are stored with the specified storage class.


=head2 ObjectReplicationStatuses => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
that have one of the specified Replication statuses.


=head2 ObjectSizeGreaterThanBytes => Int

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
whose file size is greater than the specified number of bytes.


=head2 ObjectSizeLessThanBytes => Int

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
whose file size is less than the specified number of bytes.
