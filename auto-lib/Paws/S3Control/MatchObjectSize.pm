=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::MatchObjectSize

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::MatchObjectSize object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BytesGreaterThan => $value, ..., BytesLessThan => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::MatchObjectSize object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BytesGreaterThan

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A filter condition that specifies the object size range of included
objects in bytes. Only integers are supported.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BytesGreaterThan => Int

Specifies the minimum object size in Bytes. The value must be a
positive number, greater than 0 and less than 5 TB.


=head2 BytesLessThan => Int

Specifies the maximum object size in Bytes. The value must be a
positive number, greater than the minimum object size and less than 5
TB.
