=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessControlGrants => $value, ..., UnModifiedSinceConstraint => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::S3CopyObjectOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessControlGrants

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the configuration parameters for a PUT Copy object operation.
S3 Batch Operations passes every object to the underlying C<CopyObject>
API operation. For more information about the parameters for this
operation, see CopyObject
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectCOPY.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessControlGrants => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::S3Grant>]

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 BucketKeyEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object
encryption with server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services KMS
(SSE-KMS). Setting this header to C<true> causes Amazon S3 to use an S3
Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.

Specifying this header with an I<Copy> action doesnE<rsquo>t affect
I<bucket-level> settings for S3 Bucket Key.

B<Directory buckets> - S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy
SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets to directory
buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between
directory buckets, through the Copy operation in Batch Operations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-objects-Batch-Ops).
In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request
is made for a KMS-encrypted object.


=head2 CannedAccessControlList => Str

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 ChecksumAlgorithm => Str

Indicates the algorithm that you want Amazon S3 to use to create the
checksum. For more information, see Checking object integrity
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 MetadataDirective => Str




=head2 ModifiedSinceConstraint => Str




=head2 NewObjectMetadata => L<Paws::S3Control::S3ObjectMetadata>

If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon S3 copies all the metadata
from the original objects. If you specify an empty set, the new objects
will have no tags. Otherwise, Amazon S3 assigns the supplied tags to
the new objects.


=head2 NewObjectTagging => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::S3Tag>]

Specifies a list of tags to add to the destination objects after they
are copied. If C<NewObjectTagging> is not specified, the tags of the
source objects are copied to destination objects by default.

B<Directory buckets> - Tags aren't supported by directory buckets. If
your source objects have tags and your destination bucket is a
directory bucket, specify an empty tag set in the C<NewObjectTagging>
field to prevent copying the source object tags to the directory
bucket.


=head2 ObjectLockLegalHoldStatus => Str

The legal hold status to be applied to all objects in the Batch
Operations job.

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 ObjectLockMode => Str

The retention mode to be applied to all objects in the Batch Operations
job.

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 ObjectLockRetainUntilDate => Str

The date when the applied object retention configuration expires on all
objects in the Batch Operations job.

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 RedirectLocation => Str

If the destination bucket is configured as a website, specifies an
optional metadata property for website redirects,
C<x-amz-website-redirect-location>. Allows webpage redirects if the
object copy is accessed through a website endpoint.

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 RequesterPays => Bool

This functionality is not supported by directory buckets.


=head2 SSEAwsKmsKeyId => Str

Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for
object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account
that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key
ID.

B<Directory buckets> - If you specify C<SSEAlgorithm> with C<KMS>, you
must specify the C< SSEAwsKmsKeyId> parameter with the ID (Key ID or
Key ARN) of the KMS symmetric encryption customer managed key to use.
Otherwise, you get an HTTP C<400 Bad Request> error. The key alias
format of the KMS key isn't supported. To encrypt new object copies in
a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, you must specify SSE-KMS as the
directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key
(specifically, a customer managed key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)).
The Amazon Web Services managed key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk)
(C<aws/s3>) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only
support 1 customer managed key
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#customer-cmk)
per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify
a customer managed key for SSE-KMS as the bucket default encryption,
you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS
configuration. Then, when you specify server-side encryption settings
for new object copies with SSE-KMS, you must make sure the encryption
key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the
directory bucket's default encryption configuration.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

Specify the storage class for the destination objects in a C<Copy>
operation.

B<Directory buckets > - This functionality is not supported by
directory buckets.


=head2 TargetKeyPrefix => Str

Specifies the folder prefix that you want the objects to be copied
into. For example, to copy objects into a folder named C<Folder1> in
the destination bucket, set the C<TargetKeyPrefix> property to
C<Folder1>.


=head2 TargetResource => Str

Specifies the destination bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the
batch copy operation.

=over

=item *

B<General purpose buckets> - For example, to copy objects to a general
purpose bucket named C<destinationBucket>, set the C<TargetResource>
property to C<arn:aws:s3:::destinationBucket>.

=item *

B<Directory buckets> - For example, to copy objects to a directory
bucket named C<destinationBucket> in the Availability Zone identified
by the AZ ID C<usw2-az1>, set the C<TargetResource> property to
C<arn:aws:s3express:I<region>:I<account_id>:/bucket/I<destination_bucket_base_name>--I<usw2-az1>--x-s3>.
A directory bucket as a destination bucket can be in Availability Zone
or Local Zone.

Copying objects across different Amazon Web Services Regions isn't
supported when the source or destination bucket is in Amazon Web
Services Local Zones. The source and destination buckets must have the
same parent Amazon Web Services Region. Otherwise, you get an HTTP
C<400 Bad Request> error with the error code C<InvalidRequest>.

=head2 UnModifiedSinceConstraint => Str
