Paws::S3Control::LifecycleRuleAndOperator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::LifecycleRuleAndOperator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ObjectSizeGreaterThan => $value, ..., Tags => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::LifecycleRuleAndOperator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ObjectSizeGreaterThan

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The container for the Outposts bucket lifecycle rule and operator.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ObjectSizeGreaterThan => Int

The non-inclusive minimum object size for the lifecycle rule. Setting
this property to 7 means the rule applies to objects with a size that
is greater than 7.


=head2 ObjectSizeLessThan => Int

The non-inclusive maximum object size for the lifecycle rule. Setting
this property to 77 means the rule applies to objects with a size that
is less than 77.


=head2 Prefix => Str

Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies.


=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::S3Tag>]

All of these tags must exist in the object's tag set in order for the
rule to apply.
