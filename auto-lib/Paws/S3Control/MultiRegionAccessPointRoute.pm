=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointRoute

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointRoute object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., TrafficDialPercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::MultiRegionAccessPointRoute object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure for a Multi-Region Access Point that indicates where Amazon
S3 traffic can be routed. Routes can be either active or passive.
Active routes can process Amazon S3 requests through the Multi-Region
Access Point, but passive routes are not eligible to process Amazon S3
requests.

Each route contains the Amazon S3 bucket name and the Amazon Web
Services Region that the bucket is located in. The route also includes
the C<TrafficDialPercentage> value, which shows whether the bucket and
Region are active (indicated by a value of C<100>) or passive
(indicated by a value of C<0>).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Bucket => Str

The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for which you'll submit a routing
configuration change. Either the C<Bucket> or the C<Region> value must
be provided. If both are provided, the bucket must be in the specified
Region.


=head2 Region => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region to which you'll be submitting a routing
configuration change. Either the C<Bucket> or the C<Region> value must
be provided. If both are provided, the bucket must be in the specified
Region.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrafficDialPercentage => Int

The traffic state for the specified bucket or Amazon Web Services
Region.

A value of C<0> indicates a passive state, which means that no new
traffic will be routed to the Region.

A value of C<100> indicates an active state, which means that traffic
will be routed to the specified Region.

When the routing configuration for a Region is changed from active to
passive, any in-progress operations (uploads, copies, deletes, and so
on) to the formerly active Region will continue to run to until a final
success or failure status is reached.

If all Regions in the routing configuration are designated as passive,
you'll receive an C<InvalidRequest> error.
