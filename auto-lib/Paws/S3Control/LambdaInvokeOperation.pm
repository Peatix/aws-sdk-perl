=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::LambdaInvokeOperation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::LambdaInvokeOperation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FunctionArn => $value, ..., UserArguments => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::LambdaInvokeOperation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FunctionArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the configuration parameters for a C<Lambda Invoke> operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FunctionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Lambda function that the
specified job will invoke on every object in the manifest.


=head2 InvocationSchemaVersion => Str

Specifies the schema version for the payload that Batch Operations
sends when invoking an Lambda function. Version C<1.0> is the default.
Version C<2.0> is required when you use Batch Operations to invoke
Lambda functions that act on directory buckets, or if you need to
specify C<UserArguments>. For more information, see Automate object
processing in Amazon S3 directory buckets with S3 Batch Operations and
Lambda
(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/automate-object-processing-in-amazon-s3-directory-buckets-with-s3-batch-operations-and-aws-lambda/)
in the I<Amazon Web Services Storage Blog>.

Ensure that your Lambda function code expects
C<InvocationSchemaVersion> B<2.0> and uses bucket name rather than
bucket ARN. If the C<InvocationSchemaVersion> does not match what your
Lambda function expects, your function might not work as expected.

B<Directory buckets> - To initiate Amazon Web Services Lambda function
to perform custom actions on objects in directory buckets, you must
specify C<2.0>.


=head2 UserArguments => L<Paws::S3Control::UserArguments>

Key-value pairs that are passed in the payload that Batch Operations
sends when invoking an Lambda function. You must specify
C<InvocationSchemaVersion> B<2.0> for C<LambdaInvoke> operations that
include C<UserArguments>. For more information, see Automate object
processing in Amazon S3 directory buckets with S3 Batch Operations and
Lambda
(https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/automate-object-processing-in-amazon-s3-directory-buckets-with-s3-batch-operations-and-aws-lambda/)
