=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::StorageLensGroupOrOperator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::StorageLensGroupOrOperator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MatchAnyPrefix => $value, ..., MatchObjectSize => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::StorageLensGroupOrOperator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MatchAnyPrefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A container element for specifying C<Or> rule conditions. The rule
conditions determine the subset of objects to which the C<Or> rule
applies. Objects can match any of the listed filter conditions, which
are joined by the C<Or> logical operator. Only one of each filter
condition is allowed.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MatchAnyPrefix => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Filters objects that match any of the specified prefixes.


=head2 MatchAnySuffix => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Filters objects that match any of the specified suffixes.


=head2 MatchAnyTag => ArrayRef[L<Paws::S3Control::S3Tag>]

Filters objects that match any of the specified S3 object tags.


=head2 MatchObjectAge => L<Paws::S3Control::MatchObjectAge>

Filters objects that match the specified object age range.


=head2 MatchObjectSize => L<Paws::S3Control::MatchObjectSize>

Filters objects that match the specified object size range.
