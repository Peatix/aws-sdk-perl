=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::SourceSelectionCriteria

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::SourceSelectionCriteria object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ReplicaModifications => $value, ..., SseKmsEncryptedObjects => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::SourceSelectionCriteria object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ReplicaModifications

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A container that describes additional filters for identifying the
source objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or
disable the replication of these objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ReplicaModifications => L<Paws::S3Control::ReplicaModifications>

A filter that you can use to specify whether replica modification sync
is enabled. S3 on Outposts replica modification sync can help you keep
object metadata synchronized between replicas and source objects. By
default, S3 on Outposts replicates metadata from the source objects to
the replicas only. When replica modification sync is enabled, S3 on
Outposts replicates metadata changes made to the replica copies back to
the source object, making the replication bidirectional.

To replicate object metadata modifications on replicas, you can specify
this element and set the C<Status> of this element to C<Enabled>.

You must enable replica modification sync on the source and destination
buckets to replicate replica metadata changes between the source and
the replicas.


=head2 SseKmsEncryptedObjects => L<Paws::S3Control::SseKmsEncryptedObjects>

A filter that you can use to select Amazon S3 objects that are
encrypted with server-side encryption by using Key Management Service
(KMS) keys. If you include C<SourceSelectionCriteria> in the
replication configuration, this element is required.

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.
