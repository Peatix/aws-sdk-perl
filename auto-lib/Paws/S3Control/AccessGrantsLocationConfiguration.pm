=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::AccessGrantsLocationConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::AccessGrantsLocationConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { S3SubPrefix => $value, ..., S3SubPrefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::AccessGrantsLocationConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->S3SubPrefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration options of the S3 Access Grants location. It contains
the C<S3SubPrefix> field. The grant scope, the data to which you are
granting access, is the result of appending the C<Subprefix> field to
the scope of the registered location.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 S3SubPrefix => Str

The C<S3SubPrefix> is appended to the location scope creating the grant
scope. Use this field to narrow the scope of the grant to a subset of
the location scope. This field is required if the location scope is the
default location C<s3://> because you cannot create a grant for all of
your S3 data in the Region and must narrow the scope. For example, if
the location scope is the default location C<s3://>, the C<S3SubPrefx>
can be a E<lt>bucket-nameE<gt>/*, so the full grant scope path would be
C<s3://E<lt>bucket-nameE<gt>/*>. Or the C<S3SubPrefx> can be
C<E<lt>bucket-nameE<gt>/E<lt>prefix-nameE<gt>*>, so the full grant
scope path would be or
C<s3://E<lt>bucket-nameE<gt>/E<lt>prefix-nameE<gt>*>.

If the C<S3SubPrefix> includes a prefix, append the wildcard character
C<*> after the prefix to indicate that you want to include all object
key names in the bucket that start with that prefix.
