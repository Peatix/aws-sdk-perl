=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Bucket => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Bucket

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies which S3 on Outposts objects to replicate and where to store
the replicas.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access point for the source
Outposts bucket that you want S3 on Outposts to replicate the objects
from.


=head2 DeleteMarkerReplication => L<Paws::S3Control::DeleteMarkerReplication>

Specifies whether S3 on Outposts replicates delete markers. If you
specify a C<Filter> element in your replication configuration, you must
also include a C<DeleteMarkerReplication> element. If your C<Filter>
includes a C<Tag> element, the C<DeleteMarkerReplication> element's
C<Status> child element must be set to C<Disabled>, because S3 on
Outposts doesn't support replicating delete markers for tag-based
rules.

For more information about delete marker replication, see How delete
operations affect replication
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3OutpostsReplication.html#outposts-replication-what-is-replicated)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Destination => L<Paws::S3Control::Destination>

A container for information about the replication destination and its
configurations.


=head2 ExistingObjectReplication => L<Paws::S3Control::ExistingObjectReplication>

An optional configuration to replicate existing source bucket objects.

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.


=head2 Filter => L<Paws::S3Control::ReplicationRuleFilter>

A filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication
rule applies. A C<Filter> element must specify exactly one C<Prefix>,
C<Tag>, or C<And> child element.


=head2 ID => Str

A unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.


=head2 Prefix => Str

An object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to
which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters.
To include all objects in an Outposts bucket, specify an empty string.

When you're using XML requests, you must replace special characters
(such as carriage returns) in object keys with their equivalent XML
entity codes. For more information, see XML-related object key
constraints
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html#object-key-xml-related-constraints)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 Priority => Int

The priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more
replication rules conflict. S3 on Outposts attempts to replicate
objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two
or more rules with the same destination Outposts bucket, then objects
will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The
higher the number, the higher the priority.

For more information, see Creating replication rules on Outposts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication-between-outposts.html)
in the I<Amazon S3 User Guide>.


=head2 SourceSelectionCriteria => L<Paws::S3Control::SourceSelectionCriteria>

A container that describes additional filters for identifying the
source Outposts objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to
enable or disable the replication of these objects.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Status => Str

Specifies whether the rule is enabled.
