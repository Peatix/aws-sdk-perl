=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::KeyNameConstraint

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::KeyNameConstraint object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MatchAnyPrefix => $value, ..., MatchAnySuffix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::KeyNameConstraint object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MatchAnyPrefix

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If provided, the generated manifest includes only source bucket objects
whose object keys match the string constraints specified for
C<MatchAnyPrefix>, C<MatchAnySuffix>, and C<MatchAnySubstring>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MatchAnyPrefix => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If provided, the generated manifest includes objects where the
specified string appears at the start of the object key string. Each
KeyNameConstraint filter accepts an array of strings with a length of 1
string.


=head2 MatchAnySubstring => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If provided, the generated manifest includes objects where the
specified string appears anywhere within the object key string. Each
KeyNameConstraint filter accepts an array of strings with a length of 1
string.


=head2 MatchAnySuffix => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

If provided, the generated manifest includes objects where the
specified string appears at the end of the object key string. Each
KeyNameConstraint filter accepts an array of strings with a length of 1
string.
