=head1 NAME

Paws::S3Control::Destination

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::S3Control::Destination object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessControlTranslation => $value, ..., StorageClass => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::S3Control::Destination object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessControlTranslation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies information about the replication destination bucket and its
settings for an S3 on Outposts replication configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessControlTranslation => L<Paws::S3Control::AccessControlTranslation>

Specify this property only in a cross-account scenario (where the
source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to
change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns
the destination bucket. If this property is not specified in the
replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web
Services account that owns the source object.

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.


=head2 Account => Str

The destination bucket owner's account ID.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Bucket => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the access point for the destination
bucket where you want S3 on Outposts to store the replication results.


=head2 EncryptionConfiguration => L<Paws::S3Control::EncryptionConfiguration>

A container that provides information about encryption. If
C<SourceSelectionCriteria> is specified, you must specify this element.

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.


=head2 Metrics => L<Paws::S3Control::Metrics>

A container that specifies replication metrics-related settings.


=head2 ReplicationTime => L<Paws::S3Control::ReplicationTime>

A container that specifies S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC)
settings, including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time when all
objects and operations on objects must be replicated. Must be specified
together with a C<Metrics> block.

This is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts buckets.


=head2 StorageClass => Str

The storage class to use when replicating objects. All objects stored
on S3 on Outposts are stored in the C<OUTPOSTS> storage class. S3 on
Outposts uses the C<OUTPOSTS> storage class to create the object
replicas.

Values other than C<OUTPOSTS> aren't supported by Amazon S3 on
Outposts.
