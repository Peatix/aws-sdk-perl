=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppStream::CertificateBasedAuthProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CertificateAuthorityArn => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppStream::CertificateBasedAuthProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CertificateAuthorityArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The certificate-based authentication properties used to authenticate
SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities to Active Directory
domain-joined streaming instances. Fallback is turned on by default
when certificate-based authentication is B<Enabled> . Fallback allows
users to log in using their AD domain password if certificate-based
authentication is unsuccessful, or to unlock a desktop lock screen.
B<Enabled_no_directory_login_fallback> enables certificate-based
authentication, but does not allow users to log in using their AD
domain password. Users will be disconnected to re-authenticate using
certificates.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CertificateAuthorityArn => Str

The ARN of the AWS Certificate Manager Private CA resource.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the certificate-based authentication properties.
