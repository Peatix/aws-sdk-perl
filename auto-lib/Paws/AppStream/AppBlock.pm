=head1 NAME

Paws::AppStream::AppBlock

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppStream::AppBlock object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppBlockErrors => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppStream::AppBlock object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppBlockErrors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an app block.

App blocks are an Amazon AppStream 2.0 resource that stores the details
about the virtual hard disk in an S3 bucket. It also stores the setup
script with details about how to mount the virtual hard disk. The
virtual hard disk includes the application binaries and other files
necessary to launch your applications. Multiple applications can be
assigned to a single app block.

This is only supported for Elastic fleets.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AppBlockErrors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AppStream::ErrorDetails>]

The errors of the app block.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The ARN of the app block.


=head2 CreatedTime => Str

The created time of the app block.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the app block.


=head2 DisplayName => Str

The display name of the app block.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the app block.


=head2 PackagingType => Str

The packaging type of the app block.


=head2 PostSetupScriptDetails => L<Paws::AppStream::ScriptDetails>

The post setup script details of the app block.

This only applies to app blocks with PackagingType C<APPSTREAM2>.


=head2 SetupScriptDetails => L<Paws::AppStream::ScriptDetails>

The setup script details of the app block.

This only applies to app blocks with PackagingType C<CUSTOM>.


=head2 SourceS3Location => L<Paws::AppStream::S3Location>

The source S3 location of the app block.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the app block.

An app block with AppStream 2.0 packaging will be in the C<INACTIVE>
state if no application package (VHD) is assigned to it. After an
application package (VHD) is created by an app block builder for an app
block, it becomes C<ACTIVE>.

Custom app blocks are always in the C<ACTIVE> state and no action is
required to use them.
