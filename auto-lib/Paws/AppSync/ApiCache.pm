=head1 NAME

Paws::AppSync::ApiCache

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppSync::ApiCache object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApiCachingBehavior => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppSync::ApiCache object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApiCachingBehavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<ApiCache> object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApiCachingBehavior => Str

Caching behavior.

=over

=item *

B<FULL_REQUEST_CACHING>: All requests from the same user are cached.
Individual resolvers are automatically cached. All API calls will try
to return responses from the cache.

=item *

B<PER_RESOLVER_CACHING>: Individual resolvers that you specify are
cached.

=item *

B<OPERATION_LEVEL_CACHING>: Full requests are cached together and
returned without executing resolvers.

=back



=head2 AtRestEncryptionEnabled => Bool

At-rest encryption flag for cache. You cannot update this setting after
creation.


=head2 HealthMetricsConfig => Str

Controls how cache health metrics will be emitted to CloudWatch. Cache
health metrics include:

=over

=item *

NetworkBandwidthOutAllowanceExceeded: The network packets dropped
because the throughput exceeded the aggregated bandwidth limit. This is
useful for diagnosing bottlenecks in a cache configuration.

=item *

EngineCPUUtilization: The CPU utilization (percentage) allocated to the
Redis process. This is useful for diagnosing bottlenecks in a cache
configuration.

=back

Metrics will be recorded by API ID. You can set the value to C<ENABLED>
or C<DISABLED>.


=head2 Status => Str

The cache instance status.

=over

=item *

B<AVAILABLE>: The instance is available for use.

=item *

B<CREATING>: The instance is currently creating.

=item *

B<DELETING>: The instance is currently deleting.

=item *

B<MODIFYING>: The instance is currently modifying.

=item *

B<FAILED>: The instance has failed creation.

=back



=head2 TransitEncryptionEnabled => Bool

Transit encryption flag when connecting to cache. You cannot update
this setting after creation.


=head2 Ttl => Int

TTL in seconds for cache entries.

Valid values are 1E<ndash>3,600 seconds.


=head2 Type => Str

The cache instance type. Valid values are

=over

=item *

C<SMALL>

=item *

C<MEDIUM>

=item *

C<LARGE>

=item *

C<XLARGE>

=item *

C<LARGE_2X>

=item *

C<LARGE_4X>

=item *

C<LARGE_8X> (not available in all regions)

=item *

C<LARGE_12X>

=back

Historically, instance types were identified by an EC2-style value. As
of July 2020, this is deprecated, and the generic identifiers above
should be used.

The following legacy instance types are available, but their use is
discouraged:

=over

=item *

B<T2_SMALL>: A t2.small instance type.

=item *

B<T2_MEDIUM>: A t2.medium instance type.

=item *

B<R4_LARGE>: A r4.large instance type.

=item *

B<R4_XLARGE>: A r4.xlarge instance type.

=item *

B<R4_2XLARGE>: A r4.2xlarge instance type.

=item *

B<R4_4XLARGE>: A r4.4xlarge instance type.

=item *

B<R4_8XLARGE>: A r4.8xlarge instance type.
