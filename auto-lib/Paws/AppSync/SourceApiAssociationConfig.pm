=head1 NAME

Paws::AppSync::SourceApiAssociationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppSync::SourceApiAssociationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MergeType => $value, ..., MergeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppSync::SourceApiAssociationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MergeType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes properties used to specify configurations related to a source
API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MergeType => Str

The property that indicates which merging option is enabled in the
source API association.

Valid merge types are C<MANUAL_MERGE> (default) and C<AUTO_MERGE>.
Manual merges are the default behavior and require the user to trigger
any changes from the source APIs to the merged API manually. Auto
merges subscribe the merged API to the changes performed on the source
APIs so that any change in the source APIs are also made to the merged
API. Auto merges use C<MergedApiExecutionRoleArn> to perform merge
operations.
