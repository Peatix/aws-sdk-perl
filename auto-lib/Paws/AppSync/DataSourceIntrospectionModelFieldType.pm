=head1 NAME

Paws::AppSync::DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppSync::DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Kind => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppSync::DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Kind

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the type data for each field retrieved from the
introspection.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Kind => Str

Specifies the classification of data. For example, this could be set to
values like C<Scalar> or C<NonNull> to indicate a fundamental property
of the field.

Valid values include:

=over

=item *

C<Scalar>: Indicates the value is a primitive type (scalar).

=item *

C<NonNull>: Indicates the field cannot be C<null>.

=item *

C<List>: Indicates the field contains a list.

=head2 Name => Str

The name of the data type that represents the field. For example,
C<String> is a valid C<name> value.


=head2 Type => L<Paws::AppSync::DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType>

The C<DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType> object data. The C<type>
is only present if C<DataSourceIntrospectionModelFieldType.kind> is set
to C<NonNull> or C<List>.

The C<type> typically contains its own C<kind> and C<name> fields to
represent the actual type data. For instance, C<type> could contain a
C<kind> value of C<Scalar> with a C<name> value of C<String>. The
values C<Scalar> and C<String> will be collectively stored in the
C<values> field.


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The values of the C<type> field. This field represents the AppSync data
type equivalent of the introspected field.
