This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AppFabric::IngestionDestination object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AppFabric::IngestionDestination object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn
