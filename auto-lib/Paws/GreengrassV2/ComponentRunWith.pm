=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentRunWith

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentRunWith object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PosixUser => $value, ..., WindowsUser => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentRunWith object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PosixUser

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information system user and group that the IoT Greengrass Core
software uses to run component processes on the core device. For more
information, see Configure the user and group that run components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-user)
in the I<IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 PosixUser => Str

The POSIX system user and, optionally, group to use to run this
component on Linux core devices. The user, and group if specified, must
exist on each Linux core device. Specify the user and group separated
by a colon (C<:>) in the following format: C<user:group>. The group is
optional. If you don't specify a group, the IoT Greengrass Core
software uses the primary user for the group.

If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the
default system user and group that you configure on the Greengrass
nucleus component. For more information, see Configure the user and
group that run components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-user).


=head2 SystemResourceLimits => L<Paws::GreengrassV2::SystemResourceLimits>

The system resource limits to apply to this component's process on the
core device. IoT Greengrass currently supports this feature on only
Linux core devices.

If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the
default system resource limits that you configure on the Greengrass
nucleus component. For more information, see Configure system resource
limits for components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-system-resource-limits).


=head2 WindowsUser => Str

The Windows user to use to run this component on Windows core devices.
The user must exist on each Windows core device, and its name and
password must be in the LocalSystem account's Credentials Manager
instance.

If you omit this parameter, the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the
default Windows user that you configure on the Greengrass nucleus
component. For more information, see Configure the user and group that
run components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-user).
