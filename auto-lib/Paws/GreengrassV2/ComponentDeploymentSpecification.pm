=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentDeploymentSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentDeploymentSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComponentVersion => $value, ..., RunWith => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentDeploymentSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComponentVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a component to deploy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComponentVersion => Str

The version of the component.


=head2 ConfigurationUpdate => L<Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentConfigurationUpdate>

The configuration updates to deploy for the component. You can define
I<reset> updates and I<merge> updates. A reset updates the keys that
you specify to the default configuration for the component. A merge
updates the core device's component configuration with the keys and
values that you specify. The IoT Greengrass Core software applies reset
updates before it applies merge updates. For more information, see
Update component configurations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/update-component-configurations.html)
in the I<IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide>.


=head2 RunWith => L<Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentRunWith>

The system user and group that the IoT Greengrass Core software uses to
run component processes on the core device. If you omit this parameter,
the IoT Greengrass Core software uses the system user and group that
you configure for the core device. For more information, see Configure
the user and group that run components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-user)
in the I<IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide>.
