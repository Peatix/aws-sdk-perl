=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::SystemResourceLimits

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::SystemResourceLimits object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cpus => $value, ..., Memory => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::SystemResourceLimits object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cpus

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about system resource limits that the IoT
Greengrass Core software applies to a component's processes. For more
information, see Configure system resource limits for components
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/configure-greengrass-core-v2.html#configure-component-system-resource-limits).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Cpus => Num

The maximum amount of CPU time that a component's processes can use on
the core device. A core device's total CPU time is equivalent to the
device's number of CPU cores. For example, on a core device with 4 CPU
cores, you can set this value to C<2> to limit the component's
processes to 50 percent usage of each CPU core. On a device with 1 CPU
core, you can set this value to C<0.25> to limit the component's
processes to 25 percent usage of the CPU. If you set this value to a
number greater than the number of CPU cores, the IoT Greengrass Core
software doesn't limit the component's CPU usage.


=head2 Memory => Int

The maximum amount of RAM, expressed in kilobytes, that a component's
processes can use on the core device.
