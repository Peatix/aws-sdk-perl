=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::LambdaContainerParams

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::LambdaContainerParams object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Devices => $value, ..., Volumes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::LambdaContainerParams object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Devices

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a container in which Lambda functions run on
Greengrass core devices.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Devices => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GreengrassV2::LambdaDeviceMount>]

The list of system devices that the container can access.


=head2 MemorySizeInKB => Int

The memory size of the container, expressed in kilobytes.

Default: C<16384> (16 MB)


=head2 MountROSysfs => Bool

Whether or not the container can read information from the device's
C</sys> folder.

Default: C<false>


=head2 Volumes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GreengrassV2::LambdaVolumeMount>]

The list of volumes that the container can access.
