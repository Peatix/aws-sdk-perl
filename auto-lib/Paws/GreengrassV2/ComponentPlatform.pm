Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attributes => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::ComponentPlatform object:

  $result->Att1->Attributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a platform that a component supports.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::GreengrassV2::PlatformAttributesMap>

A dictionary of attributes for the platform. The IoT Greengrass Core
software defines the C<os> and C<architecture> by default. You can
specify additional platform attributes for a core device when you
deploy the Greengrass nucleus component. For more information, see the
Greengrass nucleus component
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/v2/developerguide/greengrass-nucleus-component.html)
in the I<IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide>.


=head2 Name => Str

The friendly name of the platform. This name helps you identify the
platform.

If you omit this parameter, IoT Greengrass creates a friendly name from
the C<os> and C<architecture> of the platform.
