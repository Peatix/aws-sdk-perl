=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::InstalledComponent

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::InstalledComponent object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComponentName => $value, ..., LifecycleStatusCodes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::InstalledComponent object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComponentName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a component on a Greengrass core device.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComponentName => Str

The name of the component.


=head2 ComponentVersion => Str

The version of the component.


=head2 IsRoot => Bool

Whether or not the component is a root component.


=head2 LastInstallationSource => Str

The most recent deployment source that brought the component to the
Greengrass core device. For a thing group deployment or thing
deployment, the source will be the ID of the last deployment that
contained the component. For local deployments it will be C<LOCAL>.

Any deployment will attempt to reinstall currently broken components on
the device, which will update the last installation source.


=head2 LastReportedTimestamp => Str

The last time the Greengrass core device sent a message containing a
component's state to the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

A component does not need to see a state change for this field to
update.


=head2 LastStatusChangeTimestamp => Str

The status of how current the data is.

This response is based off of component state changes. The status
reflects component disruptions and deployments. If a component only
sees a configuration update during a deployment, it might not undergo a
state change and this status would not be updated.


=head2 LifecycleState => Str

The lifecycle state of the component.


=head2 LifecycleStateDetails => Str

A detailed response about the lifecycle state of the component that
explains the reason why a component has an error or is broken.


=head2 LifecycleStatusCodes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The status codes that indicate the reason for failure whenever the
C<lifecycleState> has an error or is in a broken state.

Greengrass nucleus v2.8.0 or later is required to get an accurate
C<lifecycleStatusCodes> response. This response can be inaccurate in
earlier Greengrass nucleus versions.
