=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::ListEffectiveDeployments - Arguments for method ListEffectiveDeployments on L<Paws::GreengrassV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListEffectiveDeployments on the
L<AWS IoT Greengrass V2|Paws::GreengrassV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListEffectiveDeployments.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListEffectiveDeployments.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $greengrass = Paws->service('GreengrassV2');
    my $ListEffectiveDeploymentsResponse =
      $greengrass->ListEffectiveDeployments(
      CoreDeviceThingName => 'MyCoreDeviceThingName',
      MaxResults          => 1,                         # OPTIONAL
      NextToken           => 'MyNextTokenString',       # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $EffectiveDeployments =
      $ListEffectiveDeploymentsResponse->EffectiveDeployments;
    my $NextToken = $ListEffectiveDeploymentsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GreengrassV2::ListEffectiveDeploymentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/greengrass/ListEffectiveDeployments>
