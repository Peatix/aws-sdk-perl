=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::EffectiveDeploymentStatusDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::EffectiveDeploymentStatusDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ErrorStack => $value, ..., ErrorTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::EffectiveDeploymentStatusDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ErrorStack

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains all error-related information for the deployment record. The
status details will be null if the deployment is in a success state.

Greengrass nucleus v2.8.0 or later is required to get an accurate
C<errorStack> and C<errorTypes> response. This field will not be
returned for earlier Greengrass nucleus versions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ErrorStack => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains an ordered list of short error codes that range from the most
generic error to the most specific one. The error codes describe the
reason for failure whenever the C<coreDeviceExecutionStatus> is in a
failed state. The response will be an empty list if there is no error.


=head2 ErrorTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains tags which describe the error. You can use the error types to
classify errors to assist with remediating the failure. The response
will be an empty list if there is no error.
