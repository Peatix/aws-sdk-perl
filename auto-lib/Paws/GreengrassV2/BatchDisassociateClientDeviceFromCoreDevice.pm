=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice - Arguments for method BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice on L<Paws::GreengrassV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice on the
L<AWS IoT Greengrass V2|Paws::GreengrassV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $greengrass = Paws->service('GreengrassV2');
    my $BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDeviceResponse =
      $greengrass->BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDevice(
      CoreDeviceThingName => 'MyIoTThingName',
      Entries             => [
        {
          ThingName => 'MyIoTThingName',    # min: 1, max: 128

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $ErrorEntries =
      $BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDeviceResponse->ErrorEntries;

# Returns a L<Paws::GreengrassV2::BatchDisassociateClientDeviceFromCoreDeviceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
