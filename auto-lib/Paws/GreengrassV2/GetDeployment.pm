    );

    # Results:
    my $Components          = $GetDeploymentResponse->Components;
    my $CreationTimestamp   = $GetDeploymentResponse->CreationTimestamp;
    my $DeploymentId        = $GetDeploymentResponse->DeploymentId;
    my $DeploymentName      = $GetDeploymentResponse->DeploymentName;
    my $DeploymentPolicies  = $GetDeploymentResponse->DeploymentPolicies;
    my $DeploymentStatus    = $GetDeploymentResponse->DeploymentStatus;
    my $IotJobArn           = $GetDeploymentResponse->IotJobArn;
    my $IotJobConfiguration = $GetDeploymentResponse->IotJobConfiguration;
    my $IotJobId            = $GetDeploymentResponse->IotJobId;
    my $IsLatestForTarget   = $GetDeploymentResponse->IsLatestForTarget;
    my $ParentTargetArn     = $GetDeploymentResponse->ParentTargetArn;
    my $RevisionId          = $GetDeploymentResponse->RevisionId;
