=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::GetCoreDevice - Arguments for method GetCoreDevice on L<Paws::GreengrassV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetCoreDevice on the
L<AWS IoT Greengrass V2|Paws::GreengrassV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetCoreDevice.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetCoreDevice.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $greengrass = Paws->service('GreengrassV2');
    my $GetCoreDeviceResponse = $greengrass->GetCoreDevice(
      CoreDeviceThingName => 'MyCoreDeviceThingName',

    );

    # Results:
    my $Architecture        = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->Architecture;
    my $CoreDeviceThingName = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->CoreDeviceThingName;
    my $CoreVersion         = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->CoreVersion;
    my $LastStatusUpdateTimestamp =
      $GetCoreDeviceResponse->LastStatusUpdateTimestamp;
    my $Platform = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->Platform;
    my $Runtime  = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->Runtime;
    my $Status   = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->Status;
    my $Tags     = $GetCoreDeviceResponse->Tags;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GreengrassV2::GetCoreDeviceResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/greengrass/GetCoreDevice>
