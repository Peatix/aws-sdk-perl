=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::CloudComponentStatus

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::CloudComponentStatus object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComponentState => $value, ..., VendorGuidanceMessage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::CloudComponentStatus object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComponentState

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the status of a component version in the IoT Greengrass
service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ComponentState => Str

The state of the component version.


=head2 Errors => L<Paws::GreengrassV2::StringMap>

A dictionary of errors that communicate why the component version is in
an error state. For example, if IoT Greengrass can't access an artifact
for the component version, then C<errors> contains the artifact's URI
as a key, and the error message as the value for that key.


=head2 Message => Str

A message that communicates details, such as errors, about the status
of the component version.


=head2 VendorGuidance => Str

The vendor guidance state for the component version. This state
indicates whether the component version has any issues that you should
consider before you deploy it. The vendor guidance state can be:

=over

=item *

C<ACTIVE> E<ndash> This component version is available and recommended
for use.

=item *

C<DISCONTINUED> E<ndash> This component version has been discontinued
by its publisher. You can deploy this component version, but we
recommend that you use a different version of this component.

=item *

C<DELETED> E<ndash> This component version has been deleted by its
publisher, so you can't deploy it. If you have any existing deployments
that specify this component version, those deployments will fail.

=back



=head2 VendorGuidanceMessage => Str

A message that communicates details about the vendor guidance state of
the component version. This message communicates why a component
version is discontinued or deleted.
