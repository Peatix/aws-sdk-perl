=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::CoreDevice

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GreengrassV2::CoreDevice object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Architecture => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GreengrassV2::CoreDevice object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Architecture

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a Greengrass core device, which is an IoT
thing that runs the IoT Greengrass Core software.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Architecture => Str

The computer architecture of the core device.


=head2 CoreDeviceThingName => Str

The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.


=head2 LastStatusUpdateTimestamp => Str

The time at which the core device's status last updated, expressed in
ISO 8601 format.


=head2 Platform => Str

The operating system platform that the core device runs.


=head2 Runtime => Str

The runtime for the core device. The runtime can be:

=over

=item *

C<aws_nucleus_classic>

=item *

C<aws_nucleus_lite>

=back



=head2 Status => Str

The status of the core device. Core devices can have the following
statuses:

=over

=item *

C<HEALTHY> E<ndash> The IoT Greengrass Core software and all components
run on the core device without issue.

=item *

C<UNHEALTHY> E<ndash> The IoT Greengrass Core software or a component
is in a failed state on the core device.

=back
