=head1 NAME

Paws::GreengrassV2::ListInstalledComponents - Arguments for method ListInstalledComponents on L<Paws::GreengrassV2>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListInstalledComponents on the
L<AWS IoT Greengrass V2|Paws::GreengrassV2> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListInstalledComponents.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListInstalledComponents.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $greengrass = Paws->service('GreengrassV2');
    my $ListInstalledComponentsResponse = $greengrass->ListInstalledComponents(
      CoreDeviceThingName => 'MyCoreDeviceThingName',
      MaxResults          => 1,                         # OPTIONAL
      NextToken           => 'MyNextTokenString',       # OPTIONAL
      TopologyFilter      => 'ALL',                     # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $InstalledComponents =
      $ListInstalledComponentsResponse->InstalledComponents;
    my $NextToken = $ListInstalledComponentsResponse->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GreengrassV2::ListInstalledComponentsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/greengrass/ListInstalledComponents>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CoreDeviceThingName => Str

The name of the core device. This is also the name of the IoT thing.



=head2 MaxResults => Int

The maximum number of results to be returned per paginated request.



=head2 NextToken => Str

The token to be used for the next set of paginated results.



=head2 TopologyFilter => Str

The filter for the list of components. Choose from the following
options:

=over

=item *

C<ALL> E<ndash> The list includes all components installed on the core
device.

=item *

C<ROOT> E<ndash> The list includes only I<root> components, which are
components that you specify in a deployment. When you choose this
option, the list doesn't include components that the core device
installs as dependencies of other components.

=back

Default: C<ROOT>

Valid values are: C<"ALL">, C<"ROOT">
