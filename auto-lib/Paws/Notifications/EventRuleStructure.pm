=head1 NAME

Paws::Notifications::EventRuleStructure

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Notifications::EventRuleStructure object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., StatusSummaryByRegion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Notifications::EventRuleStructure object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a complete list of fields related to an C<EventRule>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the C<EventRule>. CloudFormation
stack generates this ARN and then uses this ARN to associate with the
C<NotificationConfiguration>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreationTime => Str

The creation time of the C<EventRule>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventPattern => Str

An additional event pattern used to further filter the events this
C<EventRule> receives.

For more information, see Amazon EventBridge event patterns
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns.html)
in the I<Amazon EventBridge User Guide.>


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EventType => Str

The event type this rule should match with the EventBridge events. It

Amazon Web Services services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html#eb-service-event-delivery-level)
in the I< Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ManagedRules => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Amazon EventBridge Managed Rule ARNs associated with this
C<EventRule>.

These are created by User Notifications within your account so your
C<EventRules> can function.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NotificationConfigurationArn => Str

The ARN for the C<NotificationConfiguration> associated with this
C<EventRule>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Regions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of Amazon Web Services Regions that send events to this
C<EventRule>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Source => Str

The event source this rule should match with the EventBridge event
sources. It must match with atleast one of the valid EventBridge event
sources. Only Amazon Web Services service sourced events are supported.
For example, C<aws.ec2> and C<aws.cloudwatch>. For more information,
see Event delivery from Amazon Web Services services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-service-event.html#eb-service-event-delivery-level)
in the I< Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StatusSummaryByRegion => L<Paws::Notifications::StatusSummaryByRegion>

A list of an C<EventRule>'s status by Region. Regions are mapped to
C<EventRuleStatusSummary>.
