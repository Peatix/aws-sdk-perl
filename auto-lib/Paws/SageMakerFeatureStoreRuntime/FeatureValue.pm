=head1 NAME

Paws::SageMakerFeatureStoreRuntime::FeatureValue

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SageMakerFeatureStoreRuntime::FeatureValue object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FeatureName => $value, ..., ValueAsStringList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SageMakerFeatureStoreRuntime::FeatureValue object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FeatureName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The value associated with a feature.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FeatureName => Str

The name of a feature that a feature value corresponds to.


=head2 ValueAsString => Str

The value in string format associated with a feature. Used when your
C<CollectionType> is C<None>. Note that features types can be
C<String>, C<Integral>, or C<Fractional>. This value represents all
three types as a string.


=head2 ValueAsStringList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of values in string format associated with a feature. Used
when your C<CollectionType> is a C<List>, C<Set>, or C<Vector>. Note
that features types can be C<String>, C<Integral>, or C<Fractional>.
These values represents all three types as a string.
