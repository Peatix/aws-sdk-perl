=head1 NAME

Paws::ControlCatalog::RegionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ControlCatalog::RegionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeployableRegions => $value, ..., Scope => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ControlCatalog::RegionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeployableRegions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns information about the control, including the scope of the
control, if enabled, and the Regions in which the control currently is
available for deployment. For more information about scope, see Global
services
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/global-services.html).

If you are applying controls through an Amazon Web Services Control
Tower landing zone environment, remember that the values returned in
the C<RegionConfiguration> API operation are not related to the
governed Regions in your landing zone. For example, if you are
governing Regions C<A>,C<B>,and C<C> while the control is available in
Regions C<A>, C<B>, CC<,> and C<D>, you'd see a response with
C<DeployableRegions> of C<A>, C<B>, C<C>, and C<D> for a control with
C<REGIONAL> scope, even though you may not intend to deploy the control
in Region C<D>, because you do not govern it through your landing zone.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeployableRegions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Regions in which the control is available to be deployed.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Scope => Str

The coverage of the control, if deployed. Scope is an enumerated type,
with value C<Regional>, or C<Global>. A control with Global scope is
effective in all Amazon Web Services Regions, regardless of the Region
from which it is enabled, or to which it is deployed. A control
implemented by an SCP is usually Global in scope. A control with
Regional scope has operations that are restricted specifically to the
Region from which it is enabled and to which it is deployed. Controls
implemented by Config rules and CloudFormation hooks usually are
Regional in scope. Security Hub controls usually are Regional in scope.
