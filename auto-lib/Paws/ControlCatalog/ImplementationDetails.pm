=head1 NAME

Paws::ControlCatalog::ImplementationDetails

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ControlCatalog::ImplementationDetails object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ControlCatalog::ImplementationDetails object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that describes the implementation type for a control.

Our C<ImplementationDetails> C<Type> format has three required
segments:

=over

=item *

C<SERVICE-PROVIDER::SERVICE-NAME::RESOURCE-NAME>

=back

For example, C<AWS::Config::ConfigRule> B<or>
C<AWS::SecurityHub::SecurityControl> resources have the format with
three required segments.

Our C<ImplementationDetails> C<Type> format has an optional fourth
segment, which is present for applicable implementation types. The
format is as follows:

=over

=item *

C<SERVICE-PROVIDER::SERVICE-NAME::RESOURCE-NAME::RESOURCE-TYPE-DESCRIPTION>

=back

For example, C<AWS::Organizations::Policy::SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY>
B<or> C<AWS::CloudFormation::Type::HOOK> have the format with four
segments.

Although the format is similar, the values for the C<Type> field do not
match any Amazon Web Services CloudFormation values.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Identifier => Str

that implemented the control. For example, this identifier could be an

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

A string that describes a control's implementation type.
