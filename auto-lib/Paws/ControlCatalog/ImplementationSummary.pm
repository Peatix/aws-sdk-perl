=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::ControlCatalog::ImplementationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::ControlCatalog::ImplementationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of how the control is implemented, including the Amazon Web
Services service that enforces the control and its service-specific
identifier. For example, the value of this field could indicate that
the control is implemented as an Amazon Web Services Config Rule or an
Amazon Web Services Security Hub control.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

The identifier originally assigned by the Amazon Web Services service
that implements the control. For example,
C<CODEPIPELINE_DEPLOYMENT_COUNT_CHECK>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

A string that represents the Amazon Web Services service that
implements this control. For example, a value of
C<AWS::Config::ConfigRule> indicates that the control is implemented by
