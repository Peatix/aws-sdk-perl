=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ContentType => Str

Describes the format of the data that you submit to Amazon Translate as
input. You can specify one of the following multipurpose internet mail
extension (MIME) types:

=over

=item *

C<text/html>: The input data consists of one or more HTML files. Amazon
Translate translates only the text that resides in the C<html> element
in each file.

=item *

C<text/plain>: The input data consists of one or more unformatted text
files. Amazon Translate translates every character in this type of
input.

=item *

C<application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document>:
The input data consists of one or more Word documents (.docx).

=item *

C<application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation>:
The input data consists of one or more PowerPoint Presentation files
(.pptx).

=item *

C<application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet>:
The input data consists of one or more Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

=item *

C<application/x-xliff+xml>: The input data consists of one or more XML
Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) files (.xlf). Amazon
Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

=back

If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you set this
parameter to C<text/html>. By doing so, you cut costs by limiting the
translation to the contents of the C<html> element in each file.
Otherwise, if you set this parameter to C<text/plain>, your costs will
cover the translation of every character.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> S3Uri => Str

The URI of the AWS S3 folder that contains the input files. Amazon
Translate translates all the files in the folder and all its
sub-folders. The folder must be in the same Region as the API endpoint
you are calling.
