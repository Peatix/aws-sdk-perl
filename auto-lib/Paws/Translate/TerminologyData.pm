=head1 NAME

Paws::Translate::TerminologyData

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Translate::TerminologyData object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Directionality => $value, ..., Format => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Translate::TerminologyData object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Directionality

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The data associated with the custom terminology. For information about
the custom terminology file, see Creating a Custom Terminology
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/creating-custom-terminology.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Directionality => Str

The directionality of your terminology resource indicates whether it
has one source language (uni-directional) or multiple
(multi-directional).

=over

=item UNI

The terminology resource has one source language (for example, the
first column in a CSV file), and all of its other languages are target
languages.

=item MULTI

Any language in the terminology resource can be the source language or
a target language. A single multi-directional terminology resource can
be used for jobs that translate different language pairs. For example,
if the terminology contains English and Spanish terms, it can be used
for jobs that translate English to Spanish and Spanish to English.

=back

When you create a custom terminology resource without specifying the
directionality, it behaves as uni-directional terminology, although
this parameter will have a null value.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> File => Str

The file containing the custom terminology data. Your version of the
AWS SDK performs a Base64-encoding on this field before sending a
request to the AWS service. Users of the SDK should not perform
Base64-encoding themselves.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Format => Str

The data format of the custom terminology.
