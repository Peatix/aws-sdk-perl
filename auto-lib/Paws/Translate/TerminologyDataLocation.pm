=head1 DESCRIPTION

The location of the custom terminology data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Location => Str

The Amazon S3 location of the most recent custom terminology input file
that was successfully imported into Amazon Translate. The location is
returned as a presigned URL that has a 30-minute expiration .

Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for the risk of CSV
injection attacks.

CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that a
record contains malicious code. The record begins with a special
character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened in a
spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record as a
formula and run the code within it.

Before you download an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that you
recognize the file and trust its creator.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RepositoryType => Str

The repository type for the custom terminology data.
