=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Limit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A logical grouping of Performance Insights metrics for a related
subject area. For example, the C<db.sql> dimension group consists of
the following dimensions:

=over

=item *

C<db.sql.id> - The hash of a running SQL statement, generated by
Performance Insights.

=item *

C<db.sql.db_id> - Either the SQL ID generated by the database engine,
or a value generated by Performance Insights that begins with C<pi->.

=item *

C<db.sql.statement> - The full text of the SQL statement that is
running, for example, C<SELECT * FROM employees>.

=item *

C<db.sql_tokenized.id> - The hash of the SQL digest generated by
Performance Insights.

=back

Each response element returns a maximum of 500 bytes. For larger
elements, such as SQL statements, only the first 500 bytes are
returned.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of specific dimensions from a dimension group. If this list
isn't included, then all of the dimensions in the group were requested,
or are present in the response.


=head2 Group => Str

The available dimension groups for Performance Insights metric type.


=head2 Limit => Int

The maximum number of items to fetch for this dimension group.
