=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ClusterPendingModifiedValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::ClusterPendingModifiedValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., StorageType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::ClusterPendingModifiedValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is used as a response element in the C<ModifyDBCluster>
operation and contains changes that will be applied during the next
maintenance window.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB) for all database engines
except Amazon Aurora. For Aurora, C<AllocatedStorage> always returns 1,
because Aurora DB cluster storage size isn't fixed, but instead
automatically adjusts as needed.


=head2 BackupRetentionPeriod => Int

The number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.


=head2 CertificateDetails => L<Paws::RDS::CertificateDetails>




=head2 DBClusterIdentifier => Str

The DBClusterIdentifier value for the DB cluster.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The database engine version.


=head2 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.


=head2 Iops => Int

The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value. This setting is
only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 MasterUserPassword => Str

The master credentials for the DB cluster.


=head2 PendingCloudwatchLogsExports => L<Paws::RDS::PendingCloudwatchLogsExports>




=head2 RdsCustomClusterConfiguration => L<Paws::RDS::RdsCustomClusterConfiguration>

Reserved for future use.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type for the DB cluster.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::RDS>
