=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::FailoverState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::FailoverState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FromDbClusterArn => $value, ..., ToDbClusterArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::FailoverState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FromDbClusterArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the state of scheduled or in-process operations on a global
cluster (Aurora global database). This data type is empty unless a
switchover or failover operation is scheduled or is in progress on the
Aurora global database.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FromDbClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that is
currently being demoted, and which is associated with this state.


=head2 IsDataLossAllowed => Bool

Indicates whether the operation is a global switchover or a global
failover. If data loss is allowed, then the operation is a global
failover. Otherwise, it's a switchover.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the global cluster. Possible values are as
follows:

=over

=item *

pending E<150> The service received a request to switch over or fail
over the global cluster. The global cluster's primary DB cluster and
the specified secondary DB cluster are being verified before the
operation starts.

=item *

failing-over E<150> Aurora is promoting the chosen secondary Aurora DB
cluster to become the new primary DB cluster to fail over the global
cluster.

=item *

cancelling E<150> The request to switch over or fail over the global
cluster was cancelled and the primary Aurora DB cluster and the
selected secondary Aurora DB cluster are returning to their previous
states.

=item *

switching-over E<150> This status covers the range of Aurora internal
operations that take place during the switchover process, such as
demoting the primary Aurora DB cluster, promoting the secondary Aurora
DB cluster, and synchronizing replicas.

=back



=head2 ToDbClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster that is
currently being promoted, and which is associated with this state.
