=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GroupBy => $value, ..., Metric => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GroupBy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single Performance Insights metric query to process. You must provide
the metric to the query. If other parameters aren't specified,
Performance Insights returns all data points for the specified metric.
Optionally, you can request the data points to be aggregated by
dimension group (C<GroupBy>) and return only those data points that
match your criteria (C<Filter>).

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must be a valid Performance Insights query.

=back


=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GroupBy => L<Paws::RDS::PerformanceInsightsMetricDimensionGroup>

A specification for how to aggregate the data points from a query
result. You must specify a valid dimension group. Performance Insights
will return all of the dimensions within that group, unless you provide
the names of specific dimensions within that group. You can also
request that Performance Insights return a limited number of values for
a dimension.


=head2 Metric => Str

The name of a Performance Insights metric to be measured.

Valid Values:

=over

=item *

C<db.load.avg> - A scaled representation of the number of active
sessions for the database engine.

=item *

C<db.sampledload.avg> - The raw number of active sessions for the
database engine.

=item *

The counter metrics listed in Performance Insights operating system
counters
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_PerfInsights_Counters.html#USER_PerfInsights_Counters.OS)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.

=back

If the number of active sessions is less than an internal Performance
Insights threshold, C<db.load.avg> and C<db.sampledload.avg> are the
same value. If the number of active sessions is greater than the
internal threshold, Performance Insights samples the active sessions,
with C<db.load.avg> showing the scaled values, C<db.sampledload.avg>
showing the raw values, and C<db.sampledload.avg> less than
C<db.load.avg>. For most use cases, you can query C<db.load.avg> only.
