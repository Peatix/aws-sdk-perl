=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::DBClusterAutomatedBackup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::DBClusterAutomatedBackup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::DBClusterAutomatedBackup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An automated backup of a DB cluster. It consists of system backups,
transaction logs, and the database cluster properties that existed at
the time you deleted the source cluster.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, C<AllocatedStorage>
specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Aurora,
C<AllocatedStorage> always returns 1, because Aurora DB cluster storage
size isn't fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as needed.


=head2 AvailabilityZones => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Availability Zones where instances in the DB cluster can be
created. For information on Amazon Web Services Regions and
Availability Zones, see Regions and Availability Zones
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html).


=head2 AwsBackupRecoveryPointArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web
Services Backup.


=head2 BackupRetentionPeriod => Int

The retention period for the automated backups.


=head2 ClusterCreateTime => Str

The time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC).


=head2 DBClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB cluster.


=head2 DBClusterAutomatedBackupsArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the automated backups.


=head2 DBClusterIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the source DB cluster, which can't be changed and
which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 DbClusterResourceId => Str

The resource ID for the source DB cluster, which can't be changed and
which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 Engine => Str

The name of the database engine for this automated backup.


=head2 EngineMode => Str

The engine mode of the database engine for the automated backup.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The version of the database engine for the automated backup.


=head2 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.


=head2 Iops => Int

The IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the automated backup.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key ID for an automated backup.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.


=head2 LicenseModel => Str

The license model information for this DB cluster automated backup.


=head2 MasterUsername => Str

The master user name of the automated backup.


=head2 Port => Int

The port number that the automated backup used for connections.

Default: Inherits from the source DB cluster

Valid Values: C<1150-65535>


=head2 Region => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region associated with the automated backup.


=head2 RestoreWindow => L<Paws::RDS::RestoreWindow>




=head2 Status => Str

A list of status information for an automated backup:

=over

=item *

C<retained> - Automated backups for deleted clusters.

=back



=head2 StorageEncrypted => Bool

Indicates whether the source DB cluster is encrypted.


=head2 StorageThroughput => Int

The storage throughput for the automated backup. The throughput is
automatically set based on the IOPS that you provision, and is not
configurable.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The VPC ID associated with the DB cluster.
