=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ConnectionPoolConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::ConnectionPoolConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConnectionBorrowTimeout => $value, ..., SessionPinningFilters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::ConnectionPoolConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConnectionBorrowTimeout

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the settings that control the size and behavior of the
connection pool associated with a C<DBProxyTargetGroup>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConnectionBorrowTimeout => Int

The number of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connection to become
available in the connection pool. This setting only applies when the
proxy has opened its maximum number of connections and all connections
are busy with client sessions.

Default: C<120>

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must be between 0 and 3600.

=back



=head2 InitQuery => Str

Add an initialization query, or modify the current one. You can specify
one or more SQL statements for the proxy to run when opening each new
database connection. The setting is typically used with C<SET>
statements to make sure that each connection has identical settings.
Make sure that the query you add is valid. To include multiple
variables in a single C<SET> statement, use comma separators.

For example: C<SET variable1=value1, variable2=value2>

For multiple statements, use semicolons as the separator.

Default: no initialization query


=head2 MaxConnectionsPercent => Int

The maximum size of the connection pool for each target in a target
group. The value is expressed as a percentage of the C<max_connections>
setting for the RDS DB instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target
group.

If you specify C<MaxIdleConnectionsPercent>, then you must also include
a value for this parameter.

Default: C<10> for RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, and C<100> for all
other engines

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must be between 1 and 100.

=back



=head2 MaxIdleConnectionsPercent => Int

A value that controls how actively the proxy closes idle database
connections in the connection pool. The value is expressed as a
percentage of the C<max_connections> setting for the RDS DB instance or
Aurora DB cluster used by the target group. With a high value, the
proxy leaves a high percentage of idle database connections open. A low
value causes the proxy to close more idle connections and return them
to the database.

If you specify this parameter, then you must also include a value for
C<MaxConnectionsPercent>.

Default: The default value is half of the value of
C<MaxConnectionsPercent>. For example, if C<MaxConnectionsPercent> is
80, then the default value of C<MaxIdleConnectionsPercent> is 40. If
the value of C<MaxConnectionsPercent> isn't specified, then for SQL
Server, C<MaxIdleConnectionsPercent> is C<5>, and for all other
engines, the default is C<50>.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must be between 0 and the value of C<MaxConnectionsPercent>.

=back



=head2 SessionPinningFilters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Each item in the list represents a class of SQL operations that
normally cause all later statements in a session using a proxy to be
pinned to the same underlying database connection. Including an item in
the list exempts that class of SQL operations from the pinning
behavior.

Default: no session pinning filters
