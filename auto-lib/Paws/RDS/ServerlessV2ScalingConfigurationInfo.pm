=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2ScalingConfigurationInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2ScalingConfigurationInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacity => $value, ..., SecondsUntilAutoPause => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2ScalingConfigurationInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The scaling configuration for an Aurora Serverless v2 DB cluster.

For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v2
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Num

The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in
an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in
half-step increments, such as 32, 32.5, 33, and so on. The largest
value that you can use is 256 for recent Aurora versions, or 128 for
older versions.


=head2 MinCapacity => Num

The minimum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB instance in
an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify ACU values in
half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on. For Aurora versions
that support the Aurora Serverless v2 auto-pause feature, the smallest
value that you can use is 0. For versions that don't support Aurora
Serverless v2 auto-pause, the smallest value that you can use is 0.5.


=head2 SecondsUntilAutoPause => Int

The number of seconds an Aurora Serverless v2 DB instance must be idle
before Aurora attempts to automatically pause it. This property is only
shown when the minimum capacity for the cluster is set to 0 ACUs.
Changing the minimum capacity to a nonzero value removes this property.
If you later change the minimum capacity back to 0 ACUs, this property
is reset to its default value unless you specify it again.

This value ranges between 300 seconds (five minutes) and 86,400 seconds
(one day). The default is 300 seconds.
