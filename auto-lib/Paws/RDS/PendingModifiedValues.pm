=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::PendingModifiedValues

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::PendingModifiedValues object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., StorageType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::PendingModifiedValues object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is used as a response element in the C<ModifyDBInstance>
operation and contains changes that will be applied during the next
maintenance window.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The allocated storage size for the DB instance specified in gibibytes
(GiB).


=head2 AutomationMode => Str

The automation mode of the RDS Custom DB instance: C<full> or
C<all-paused>. If C<full>, the DB instance automates monitoring and
instance recovery. If C<all-paused>, the instance pauses automation for
the duration set by C<--resume-full-automation-mode-minutes>.


=head2 BackupRetentionPeriod => Int

The number of days for which automated backups are retained.


=head2 CACertificateIdentifier => Str

The identifier of the CA certificate for the DB instance.

For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a DB
instance
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide> and Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a
connection to a DB cluster
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.


=head2 DBInstanceClass => Str

The name of the compute and memory capacity class for the DB instance.


=head2 DBInstanceIdentifier => Str

The database identifier for the DB instance.


=head2 DBSubnetGroupName => Str

The DB subnet group for the DB instance.


=head2 DedicatedLogVolume => Bool

Indicates whether the DB instance has a dedicated log volume (DLV)
enabled.E<gt>


=head2 Engine => Str

The database engine of the DB instance.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The database engine version.


=head2 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.


=head2 Iops => Int

The Provisioned IOPS value for the DB instance.


=head2 LicenseModel => Str

The license model for the DB instance.

Valid values: C<license-included> | C<bring-your-own-license> |
C<general-public-license>


=head2 MasterUserPassword => Str

The master credentials for the DB instance.


=head2 MultiAZ => Bool

Indicates whether the Single-AZ DB instance will change to a Multi-AZ
deployment.


=head2 MultiTenant => Bool

Indicates whether the DB instance will change to the multi-tenant
configuration (TRUE) or the single-tenant configuration (FALSE).


=head2 PendingCloudwatchLogsExports => L<Paws::RDS::PendingCloudwatchLogsExports>




=head2 Port => Int

The port for the DB instance.


=head2 ProcessorFeatures => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::ProcessorFeature>]

The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB
instance class of the DB instance.


=head2 ResumeFullAutomationModeTime => Str

The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time period
ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value is 60
(default). The maximum value is 1,440.


=head2 StorageThroughput => Int

The storage throughput of the DB instance.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type of the DB instance.
