The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream used for the database
activity stream.


=head2 ActivityStreamKmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier used for encrypting messages
in the database activity stream.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.


=head2 ActivityStreamMode => Str

The mode of the database activity stream. Database events such as a
change or access generate an activity stream event. The database
session can handle these events either synchronously or asynchronously.


=head2 ActivityStreamStatus => Str

The status of the database activity stream.


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

C<AllocatedStorage> specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes
(GiB). For Aurora, C<AllocatedStorage> can vary because Aurora DB
cluster storage size adjusts as needed.


=head2 AssociatedRoles => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::DBClusterRole>]

A list of the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM)
roles that are associated with the DB cluster. IAM roles that are
associated with a DB cluster grant permission for the DB cluster to
access other Amazon Web Services on your behalf.


=head2 AutomaticRestartTime => Str

The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.


=head2 AutoMinorVersionUpgrade => Bool

Indicates whether minor version patches are applied automatically.

This setting is for Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters.

For more information about automatic minor version upgrades, see
Automatically upgrading the minor engine version
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Upgrading.AutoMinorVersionUpgrades).


=head2 AvailabilityZones => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in the DB cluster
can be created.

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in Amazon Web
Services Backup.


=head2 BacktrackConsumedChangeRecords => Int

The number of change records stored for Backtrack.


=head2 BacktrackWindow => Int

The target backtrack window, in seconds. If this value is set to C<0>,
backtracking is disabled for the DB cluster. Otherwise, backtracking is
enabled.


=head2 BackupRetentionPeriod => Int

The number of days for which automatic DB snapshots are retained.


=head2 Capacity => Int

The current capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster. The
capacity is C<0> (zero) when the cluster is paused.

For more information about Aurora Serverless v1, see Using Amazon
Aurora Serverless v1
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.

=head2 CharacterSetName => Str

If present, specifies the name of the character set that this cluster
is associated with.


=head2 CloneGroupId => Str

The ID of the clone group with which the DB cluster is associated. For
newly created clusters, the ID is typically null.

If you clone a DB cluster when the ID is null, the operation populates
the ID value for the source cluster and the clone because both clusters
become part of the same clone group. Even if you delete the clone
cluster, the clone group ID remains for the lifetime of the source
cluster to show that it was used in a cloning operation.

For PITR, the clone group ID is inherited from the source cluster. For
snapshot restore operations, the clone group ID isn't inherited from
the source cluster.


=head2 ClusterCreateTime => Str

The time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC).


=head2 ClusterScalabilityType => Str

The scalability mode of the Aurora DB cluster. When set to
C<limitless>, the cluster operates as an Aurora Limitless Database.

Zones.


=head2 NetworkType => Str

The network type of the DB instance.

The network type is determined by the C<DBSubnetGroup> specified for
the DB cluster. A C<DBSubnetGroup> can support only the IPv4 protocol
or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (C<DUAL>).

For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide.>

This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.

C<BackupRetentionPeriod>.


=head2 PreferredMaintenanceWindow => Str

The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, in
Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).


=head2 PubliclyAccessible => Bool

Indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible.

When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside
of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain Name System
(DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from
within the same VPC as the DB cluster, the endpoint resolves to the
private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled
by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if
the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see CreateDBCluster.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 RdsCustomClusterConfiguration => L<Paws::RDS::RdsCustomClusterConfiguration>

Reserved for future use.


=head2 ReaderEndpoint => Str

The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for a DB
cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora Replicas that are
available in a DB cluster. As clients request new connections to the
reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the connection requests among the
Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster. This functionality can help balance
your read workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

If a failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are connected to
is promoted to be the primary instance, your connection is dropped. To
continue sending your read workload to other Aurora Replicas in the
cluster, you can then reconnect to the reader endpoint.


=head2 ReadReplicaIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Contains one or more identifiers of the read replicas associated with
this DB cluster.


=head2 ReplicationSourceIdentifier => Str

The identifier of the source DB cluster if this DB cluster is a read
replica.


=head2 ScalingConfigurationInfo => L<Paws::RDS::ScalingConfigurationInfo>




=head2 ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration => L<Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2ScalingConfigurationInfo>




=head2 Status => Str

The current state of this DB cluster.


=head2 StatusInfos => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::DBClusterStatusInfo>]

Reserved for future use.


=head2 StorageEncrypted => Bool

Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted.


=head2 StorageThroughput => Int

The storage throughput for the DB cluster. The throughput is
automatically set based on the IOPS that you provision, and is not
configurable.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type associated with the DB cluster.


=head2 TagList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::Tag>]




=head2 VpcSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::VpcSecurityGroupMembership>]

The list of VPC security groups that the DB cluster belongs to.
