=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::UpgradeTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::UpgradeTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoUpgrade => $value, ..., SupportsParallelQuery => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::UpgradeTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoUpgrade

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The version of the database engine that a DB instance can be upgraded
to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoUpgrade => Bool

Indicates whether the target version is applied to any source DB
instances that have C<AutoMinorVersionUpgrade> set to true.

This parameter is dynamic, and is set by RDS.


=head2 Description => Str

The version of the database engine that a DB instance can be upgraded
to.


=head2 Engine => Str

The name of the upgrade target database engine.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The version number of the upgrade target database engine.


=head2 IsMajorVersionUpgrade => Bool

Indicates whether upgrading to the target version requires upgrading
the major version of the database engine.


=head2 SupportedEngineModes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the supported DB engine modes for the target engine version.


=head2 SupportsBabelfish => Bool

Indicates whether you can use Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL with the
target engine version.


=head2 SupportsGlobalDatabases => Bool

Indicates whether you can use Aurora global databases with the target
engine version.


=head2 SupportsIntegrations => Bool

Indicates whether the DB engine version supports zero-ETL integrations
with Amazon Redshift.


=head2 SupportsLimitlessDatabase => Bool

Indicates whether the DB engine version supports Aurora Limitless
Database.


=head2 SupportsLocalWriteForwarding => Bool

Indicates whether the target engine version supports forwarding write
operations from reader DB instances to the writer DB instance in the DB
cluster. By default, write operations aren't allowed on reader DB
instances.

Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only


=head2 SupportsParallelQuery => Bool

Indicates whether you can use Aurora parallel query with the target
engine version.
