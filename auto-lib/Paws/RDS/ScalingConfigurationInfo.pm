=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ScalingConfigurationInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::ScalingConfigurationInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoPause => $value, ..., TimeoutAction => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::ScalingConfigurationInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoPause

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The scaling configuration for an Aurora DB cluster in C<serverless> DB
engine mode.

For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless v1
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoPause => Bool

Indicates whether automatic pause is allowed for the Aurora DB cluster
in C<serverless> DB engine mode.

When the value is set to false for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster,
the DB cluster automatically resumes.


=head2 MaxCapacity => Int

The maximum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in C<serverless> DB
engine mode.


=head2 MinCapacity => Int

The minimum capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in C<serverless> DB
engine mode.


=head2 SecondsBeforeTimeout => Int

The number of seconds before scaling times out. What happens when an
attempted scaling action times out is determined by the
C<TimeoutAction> setting.


=head2 SecondsUntilAutoPause => Int

The remaining amount of time, in seconds, before the Aurora DB cluster
in C<serverless> mode is paused. A DB cluster can be paused only when
it's idle (it has no connections).


=head2 TimeoutAction => Str

The action that occurs when Aurora times out while attempting to change
the capacity of an Aurora Serverless v1 cluster. The value is either
C<ForceApplyCapacityChange> or C<RollbackCapacityChange>.

C<ForceApplyCapacityChange>, the default, sets the capacity to the
specified value as soon as possible.

C<RollbackCapacityChange> ignores the capacity change if a scaling
point isn't found in the timeout period.
