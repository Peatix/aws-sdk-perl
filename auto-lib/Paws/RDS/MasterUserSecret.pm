=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::MasterUserSecret

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::MasterUserSecret object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { KmsKeyId => $value, ..., SecretStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::MasterUserSecret object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->KmsKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the secret managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets
Manager for the master user password.

For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services
Secrets Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide> and Password management with Amazon Web
Services Secrets Manager
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/rds-secrets-manager.html)
in the I<Amazon Aurora User Guide.>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that is used to encrypt the
secret.


=head2 SecretArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.


=head2 SecretStatus => Str

The status of the secret.

The possible status values include the following:

=over

=item *

C<creating> - The secret is being created.

=item *

C<active> - The secret is available for normal use and rotation.

=item *

C<rotating> - The secret is being rotated.

=item *

C<impaired> - The secret can be used to access database credentials,
but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this status if, for
example, permissions are changed so that RDS can no longer access
either the secret or the KMS key for the secret.

When a secret has this status, you can correct the condition that
caused the status. Alternatively, modify the DB instance to turn off
automatic management of database credentials, and then modify the DB
instance again to turn on automatic management of database credentials.
