=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::DBClusterSnapshot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::DBClusterSnapshot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedStorage => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::DBClusterSnapshot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedStorage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains the details for an Amazon RDS DB cluster snapshot

This data type is used as a response element in the
C<DescribeDBClusterSnapshots> action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedStorage => Int

The allocated storage size of the DB cluster snapshot in gibibytes
(GiB).


=head2 AvailabilityZones => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in the DB cluster
snapshot can be restored.


=head2 ClusterCreateTime => Str

The time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC).


=head2 DBClusterIdentifier => Str

The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster that this DB cluster
snapshot was created from.


=head2 DbClusterResourceId => Str

The resource ID of the DB cluster that this DB cluster snapshot was
created from.


=head2 DBClusterSnapshotArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 DBSystemId => Str

Reserved for future use.


=head2 Engine => Str

The name of the database engine for this DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 EngineMode => Str

The engine mode of the database engine for this DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The version of the database engine for this DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access
Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled.


=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

If C<StorageEncrypted> is true, the Amazon Web Services KMS key
identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot.

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.


=head2 LicenseModel => Str

The license model information for this DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 MasterUsername => Str

The master username for this DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 PercentProgress => Int

The percentage of the estimated data that has been transferred.


=head2 Port => Int

The port that the DB cluster was listening on at the time of the
snapshot.


=head2 SnapshotCreateTime => Str

The time when the snapshot was taken, in Universal Coordinated Time
(UTC).


=head2 SnapshotType => Str

The type of the DB cluster snapshot.


=head2 SourceDBClusterSnapshotArn => Str

If the DB cluster snapshot was copied from a source DB cluster
snapshot, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB cluster
snapshot, otherwise, a null value.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of this DB cluster snapshot. Valid statuses are the
following:

=over

=item *

C<available>

=item *

C<copying>

=item *

C<creating>

=back



=head2 StorageEncrypted => Bool

Indicates whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.


=head2 StorageThroughput => Int

The storage throughput for the DB cluster snapshot. The throughput is
automatically set based on the IOPS that you provision, and is not
configurable.

This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type associated with the DB cluster snapshot.

This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.


=head2 TagList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::Tag>]




=head2 VpcId => Str

The VPC ID associated with the DB cluster snapshot.
