=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::GlobalCluster

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::GlobalCluster object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DatabaseName => $value, ..., TagList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::GlobalCluster object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DatabaseName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A data type representing an Aurora global database.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DatabaseName => Str

The default database name within the new global database cluster.


=head2 DeletionProtection => Bool

The deletion protection setting for the new global database cluster.


=head2 Endpoint => Str

The writer endpoint for the new global database cluster. This endpoint
always points to the writer DB instance in the current primary cluster.


=head2 Engine => Str

The Aurora database engine used by the global database cluster.


=head2 EngineLifecycleSupport => Str

The life cycle type for the global cluster.

For more information, see CreateGlobalCluster.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

Indicates the database engine version.


=head2 FailoverState => L<Paws::RDS::FailoverState>

A data object containing all properties for the current state of an
in-process or pending switchover or failover process for this global
cluster (Aurora global database). This object is empty unless the
C<SwitchoverGlobalCluster> or C<FailoverGlobalCluster> operation was
called on this global cluster.


=head2 GlobalClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the global database cluster.


=head2 GlobalClusterIdentifier => Str

Contains a user-supplied global database cluster identifier. This
identifier is the unique key that identifies a global database cluster.


=head2 GlobalClusterMembers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::GlobalClusterMember>]

The list of primary and secondary clusters within the global database
cluster.


=head2 GlobalClusterResourceId => Str

The Amazon Web Services Region-unique, immutable identifier for the
global database cluster. This identifier is found in Amazon Web
Services CloudTrail log entries whenever the Amazon Web Services KMS
key for the DB cluster is accessed.


=head2 Status => Str

Specifies the current state of this global database cluster.


=head2 StorageEncrypted => Bool

The storage encryption setting for the global database cluster.


=head2 TagList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::Tag>]





=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::RDS>
