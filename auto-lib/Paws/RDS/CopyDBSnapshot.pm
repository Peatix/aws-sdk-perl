=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::CopyDBSnapshot - Arguments for method CopyDBSnapshot on L<Paws::RDS>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CopyDBSnapshot on the
L<Amazon Relational Database Service|Paws::RDS> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CopyDBSnapshot.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CopyDBSnapshot.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $rds = Paws->service('RDS');
    # To copy a DB snapshot
    # This example copies a DB snapshot.
    my $CopyDBSnapshotResult = $rds->CopyDBSnapshot(
      'SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier' => 'mydbsnapshot',
      'TargetDBSnapshotIdentifier' => 'mydbsnapshot-copy'
    );

    # Results:
    my $DBSnapshot = $CopyDBSnapshotResult->DBSnapshot;

    # Returns a L<Paws::RDS::CopyDBSnapshotResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/rds/CopyDBSnapshot>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CopyOptionGroup => Bool

Specifies whether to copy the DB option group associated with the
source DB snapshot to the target Amazon Web Services account and
associate with the target DB snapshot. The associated option group can
be copied only with cross-account snapshot copy calls.



=head2 CopyTags => Bool

Specifies whether to copy all tags from the source DB snapshot to the
target DB snapshot. By default, tags aren't copied.



=head2 KmsKeyId => Str

The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB
snapshot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,
key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your Amazon Web Services
account, you can specify a value for this parameter to encrypt the copy
with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for this parameter,
then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same Amazon Web
Services KMS key as the source DB snapshot.

If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that is shared from another Amazon
Web Services account, then you must specify a value for this parameter.

If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot,
the copy is encrypted.

If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different Amazon Web Services
Region, then you must specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier
for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific
to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you
can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another
Amazon Web Services Region.



=head2 OptionGroupName => Str

The name of an option group to associate with the copy of the snapshot.

Specify this option if you are copying a snapshot from one Amazon Web
Services Region to another, and your DB instance uses a nondefault
option group. If your source DB instance uses Transparent Data
Encryption for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, you must specify this
option when copying across Amazon Web Services Regions. For more
information, see Option group considerations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_CopySnapshot.html#USER_CopySnapshot.Options)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide>.



=head2 PreSignedUrl => Str

When you are copying a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud
(US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4
signed request for the C<CopyDBSnapshot> API operation in the source
Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB snapshot to
copy.

This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions.
It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

You must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot
from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API.
Don't specify C<PreSignedUrl> when you are copying an encrypted DB
snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

The presigned URL must be a valid request for the
C<CopyDBClusterSnapshot> API operation that can run in the source
Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster
snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following
parameter values:

=over

=item *

C<DestinationRegion> - The Amazon Web Services Region that the
encrypted DB snapshot is copied to. This Amazon Web Services Region is
the same one where the C<CopyDBSnapshot> operation is called that
contains this presigned URL.

For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2
Amazon Web Services Region to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region,
then you call the C<CopyDBSnapshot> operation in the us-east-1 Amazon
Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to
the C<CopyDBSnapshot> operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services
Region. For this example, the C<DestinationRegion> in the presigned URL
must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

=item *

C<KmsKeyId> - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt
the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services
Region. This is the same identifier for both the C<CopyDBSnapshot>
operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region,
and the operation contained in the presigned URL.

=item *

C<SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier> - The DB snapshot identifier for the
encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon
Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region.
For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the
us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
C<SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier> looks like the following example:
C<arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115>.

=back

To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
Signature Version 4)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-query-string-auth.html)
and Signature Version 4 Signing Process
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html).

If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can
specify C<SourceRegion> (or C<--source-region> for the CLI) instead of
specifying C<PreSignedUrl> manually. Specifying C<SourceRegion>
autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation
that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the source DB snapshot.

If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the
copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. For example, you might
specify C<rds:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805>.

If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services Region
than the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot ARN. For example, you might
specify
C<arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805>.

If you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter
must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.

If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must be in the
ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

=back

Example: C<rds:mydb-2012-04-02-00-01>

Example:
C<arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805>



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::Tag>]





=head2 TargetCustomAvailabilityZone => Str

The external custom Availability Zone (CAZ) identifier for the target
CAZ.

Example: C<rds-caz-aiqhTgQv>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetDBSnapshotIdentifier => Str

The identifier for the copy of the snapshot.

Constraints:

=over

=item *

Can't be null, empty, or blank

=item *

Must contain from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens

=item *

First character must be a letter

=item *

Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

=back

Example: C<my-db-snapshot>
