=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::OrderableDBInstanceOption

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::OrderableDBInstanceOption object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AvailabilityZoneGroup => $value, ..., Vpc => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::OrderableDBInstanceOption object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AvailabilityZoneGroup

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains a list of available options for a DB instance.

This data type is used as a response element in the
C<DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions> action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AvailabilityZoneGroup => Str

The Availability Zone group for a DB instance.


=head2 AvailabilityZones => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::AvailabilityZone>]

A list of Availability Zones for a DB instance.


=head2 AvailableProcessorFeatures => ArrayRef[L<Paws::RDS::AvailableProcessorFeature>]

A list of the available processor features for the DB instance class of
a DB instance.


=head2 DBInstanceClass => Str

The DB instance class for a DB instance.


=head2 Engine => Str

The engine type of a DB instance.


=head2 EngineVersion => Str

The engine version of a DB instance.


=head2 LicenseModel => Str

The license model for a DB instance.


=head2 MaxIopsPerDbInstance => Int

Maximum total provisioned IOPS for a DB instance.


=head2 MaxIopsPerGib => Num

Maximum provisioned IOPS per GiB for a DB instance.


=head2 MaxStorageSize => Int

Maximum storage size for a DB instance.


=head2 MaxStorageThroughputPerDbInstance => Int

Maximum storage throughput for a DB instance.


=head2 MaxStorageThroughputPerIops => Num

Maximum storage throughput to provisioned IOPS ratio for a DB instance.


=head2 MinIopsPerDbInstance => Int

Minimum total provisioned IOPS for a DB instance.


=head2 MinIopsPerGib => Num

Minimum provisioned IOPS per GiB for a DB instance.


=head2 MinStorageSize => Int

Minimum storage size for a DB instance.


=head2 MinStorageThroughputPerDbInstance => Int

Minimum storage throughput for a DB instance.


=head2 MinStorageThroughputPerIops => Num

Minimum storage throughput to provisioned IOPS ratio for a DB instance.


=head2 MultiAZCapable => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance is Multi-AZ capable.


=head2 OutpostCapable => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports RDS on Outposts.

For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Amazon RDS on Amazon
Web Services Outposts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/rds-on-outposts.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide.>


=head2 ReadReplicaCapable => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance can have a read replica.


=head2 StorageType => Str

The storage type for a DB instance.


=head2 SupportedActivityStreamModes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of supported modes for Database Activity Streams. Aurora
PostgreSQL returns the value C<[sync, async]>. Aurora MySQL and RDS for
Oracle return C<[async]> only. If Database Activity Streams isn't
supported, the return value is an empty list.


=head2 SupportedEngineModes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the supported DB engine modes.


=head2 SupportedNetworkTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The network types supported by the DB instance (C<IPV4> or C<DUAL>).

A DB instance can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the
IPv6 protocols (C<DUAL>).

For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide.>


=head2 SupportsClusters => Bool

Indicates whether DB instances can be configured as a Multi-AZ DB
cluster.

For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
with two readable standby DB instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/multi-az-db-clusters-concepts.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide.>


=head2 SupportsDedicatedLogVolume => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports using a dedicated log volume
(DLV).


=head2 SupportsEnhancedMonitoring => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports Enhanced Monitoring at
intervals from 1 to 60 seconds.


=head2 SupportsGlobalDatabases => Bool

Indicates whether you can use Aurora global databases with a specific
combination of other DB engine attributes.


=head2 SupportsIAMDatabaseAuthentication => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports IAM database authentication.


=head2 SupportsIops => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports provisioned IOPS.


=head2 SupportsKerberosAuthentication => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports Kerberos Authentication.


=head2 SupportsPerformanceInsights => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports Performance Insights.


=head2 SupportsStorageAutoscaling => Bool

Indicates whether Amazon RDS can automatically scale storage for DB
instances that use the specified DB instance class.


=head2 SupportsStorageEncryption => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports encrypted storage.


=head2 SupportsStorageThroughput => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance supports storage throughput.


=head2 Vpc => Bool

Indicates whether a DB instance is in a VPC.
