=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::DBInstance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded => $value, ..., VpcSecurityGroups => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::DBInstance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data type is used as a response element in the operations
C<CreateDBInstance>, C<CreateDBInstanceReadReplica>,
C<DeleteDBInstance>, C<DescribeDBInstances>, C<ModifyDBInstance>,
C<PromoteReadReplica>, C<RebootDBInstance>,
C<RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot>, C<RestoreDBInstanceFromS3>,

Indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from
outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its Domain

connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance, the endpoint
resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is
ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access
isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster
doesn't permit it.

When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

For more information, see CreateDBInstance.


=head2 ReadReplicaDBClusterIdentifiers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

cluster for the Aurora read replica is shown. This output doesn't
contain information about cross-Region Aurora read replicas.

Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one Aurora read replica.

Replicas for Amazon RDS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/oracle-read-replicas.html)
in the I<Amazon RDS User Guide>.

This attribute is only supported in RDS for Oracle.


=head2 ResumeFullAutomationModeTime => Str

ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value is 60
(default). The maximum value is 1,440.


=head2 SecondaryAvailabilityZone => Str

If present, specifies the name of the secondary Availability Zone for a
DB instance with multi-AZ support.

The status of a read replica. If the DB instance isn't a read replica,
the value is blank.
