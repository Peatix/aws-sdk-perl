=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::GlobalClusterMember

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::GlobalClusterMember object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DBClusterArn => $value, ..., SynchronizationStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::GlobalClusterMember object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DBClusterArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A data structure with information about any primary and secondary
clusters associated with a global cluster (Aurora global database).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DBClusterArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each Aurora DB cluster in the global
cluster.


=head2 GlobalWriteForwardingStatus => Str

The status of write forwarding for a secondary cluster in the global
cluster.


=head2 IsWriter => Bool

Indicates whether the Aurora DB cluster is the primary cluster (that
is, has read-write capability) for the global cluster with which it is
associated.


=head2 Readers => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for each read-only secondary cluster
associated with the global cluster.


=head2 SynchronizationStatus => Str

The status of synchronization of each Aurora DB cluster in the global
cluster.
