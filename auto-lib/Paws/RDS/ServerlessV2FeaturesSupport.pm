=head1 NAME

Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2FeaturesSupport

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2FeaturesSupport object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxCapacity => $value, ..., MinCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RDS::ServerlessV2FeaturesSupport object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies any Aurora Serverless v2 properties or limits that differ
between Aurora engine versions. You can test the values of this
attribute when deciding which Aurora version to use in a new or
upgraded DB cluster. You can also retrieve the version of an existing
DB cluster and check whether that version supports certain Aurora
Serverless v2 features before you attempt to use those features.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Num

Specifies the upper Aurora Serverless v2 capacity limit for a
particular engine version. Depending on the engine version, the maximum
capacity for an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster might be C<256> or C<128>.


=head2 MinCapacity => Num

If the minimum capacity is 0 ACUs, the engine version supports the
automatic pause/resume feature of Aurora Serverless v2.
