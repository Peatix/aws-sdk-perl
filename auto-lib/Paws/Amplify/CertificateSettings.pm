=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Amplify::CertificateSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CustomCertificateArn => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Amplify::CertificateSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CustomCertificateArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The type of SSL/TLS certificate to use for your custom domain. If a
certificate type isn't specified, Amplify uses the default
C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED> certificate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomCertificateArn => Str

The Amazon resource name (ARN) for the custom certificate that you have
already added to Certificate Manager in your Amazon Web Services
account.

This field is required only when the certificate type is C<CUSTOM>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The certificate type.

Specify C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED> to use the default certificate that Amplify
provisions for you.

Specify C<CUSTOM> to use your own certificate that you have already
added to Certificate Manager in your Amazon Web Services account. Make
sure you request (or import) the certificate in the US East (N.
