=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Amplify::CacheConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Amplify::CacheConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the cache configuration for an Amplify app.

For more information about how Amplify applies an optimal cache
configuration for your app based on the type of content that is being
served, see Managing cache configuration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/managing-cache-configuration)
in the I<Amplify User guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of cache configuration to use for an Amplify app.

The C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED> cache configuration automatically applies an
optimized cache configuration for your app based on its platform,
routing rules, and rewrite rules. This is the default setting.

The C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED_NO_COOKIES> cache configuration type is the same
as C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED>, except that it excludes all cookies from the
cache key.
