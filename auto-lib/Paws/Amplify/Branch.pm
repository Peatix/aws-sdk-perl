=head1 NAME

Paws::Amplify::Branch

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Amplify::Branch object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ActiveJobId => $value, ..., UpdateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Amplify::Branch object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ActiveJobId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The branch for an Amplify app, which maps to a third-party repository
branch.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ActiveJobId => Str

The ID of the active job for a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 AssociatedResources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of custom resources that are linked to this branch.


=head2 Backend => L<Paws::Amplify::Backend>




=head2 BackendEnvironmentArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a backend environment that is part
of an Amplify app.

This property is available to Amplify Gen 1 apps only. When you deploy
an application with Amplify Gen 2, you provision the app's backend
infrastructure using Typescript code.


=head2 BasicAuthCredentials => Str

The basic authorization credentials for a branch of an Amplify app. You
must base64-encode the authorization credentials and provide them in
the format C<user:password>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BranchArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a branch that is part of an Amplify
app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BranchName => Str

The name for the branch that is part of an Amplify app.


=head2 BuildSpec => Str

The build specification (build spec) content for the branch of an
Amplify app.


=head2 ComputeRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for a branch of an SSR
app. The Compute role allows the Amplify Hosting compute service to
securely access specific Amazon Web Services resources based on the
role's permissions. For more information about the SSR Compute role,
see Adding an SSR Compute role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-SSR-compute-role.html)
in the I<Amplify User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreateTime => Str

A timestamp of when Amplify created the branch.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CustomDomains => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The custom domains for a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

The description for the branch that is part of an Amplify app.


=head2 DestinationBranch => Str

The destination branch if the branch is a pull request branch.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DisplayName => Str

The display name for the branch. This is used as the default domain
prefix.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableAutoBuild => Bool

Enables auto-building on push for a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableBasicAuth => Bool

Enables basic authorization for a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableNotification => Bool

Enables notifications for a branch that is part of an Amplify app.


=head2 EnablePerformanceMode => Bool

Enables performance mode for the branch.

Performance mode optimizes for faster hosting performance by keeping
content cached at the edge for a longer interval. When performance mode
is enabled, hosting configuration or code changes can take up to 10
minutes to roll out.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnablePullRequestPreview => Bool

Enables pull request previews for the branch.


=head2 EnableSkewProtection => Bool

Specifies whether the skew protection feature is enabled for the
branch.

Deployment skew protection is available to Amplify applications to
eliminate version skew issues between client and servers in web
applications. When you apply skew protection to a branch, you can
ensure that your clients always interact with the correct version of
server-side assets, regardless of when a deployment occurs. For more
information about skew protection, see Skew protection for Amplify
deployments
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/skew-protection.html)
in the I<Amplify User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnvironmentVariables => L<Paws::Amplify::EnvironmentVariables>

The environment variables specific to a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Framework => Str

The framework for a branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 PullRequestEnvironmentName => Str

The Amplify environment name for the pull request.


=head2 SourceBranch => Str

The source branch if the branch is a pull request branch.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Stage => Str

The current stage for the branch that is part of an Amplify app.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Amplify::TagMap>

The tag for the branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 ThumbnailUrl => Str

The thumbnail URL for the branch of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TotalNumberOfJobs => Str

The total number of jobs that are part of an Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Ttl => Str

The content Time to Live (TTL) for the website in seconds.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdateTime => Str

A timestamp for the last updated time for a branch.
