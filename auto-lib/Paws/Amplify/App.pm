=head1 NAME

Paws::Amplify::App

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Amplify::App object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AppArn => $value, ..., WebhookCreateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Amplify::App object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AppArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents the different branches of a repository for building,
deploying, and hosting an Amplify app.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AppId => Str

The unique ID of the Amplify app.


=head2 AutoBranchCreationConfig => L<Paws::Amplify::AutoBranchCreationConfig>

Describes the automated branch creation configuration for the Amplify
app.


=head2 AutoBranchCreationPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Describes the automated branch creation glob patterns for the Amplify
app.


=head2 BasicAuthCredentials => Str

The basic authorization credentials for branches for the Amplify app.
You must base64-encode the authorization credentials and provide them
in the format C<user:password>.


=head2 BuildSpec => Str

Describes the content of the build specification (build spec) for the
Amplify app.


=head2 CacheConfig => L<Paws::Amplify::CacheConfig>

The cache configuration for the Amplify app. If you don't specify the
cache configuration C<type>, Amplify uses the default
C<AMPLIFY_MANAGED> setting.


=head2 ComputeRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for an SSR app. The
Compute role allows the Amplify Hosting compute service to securely
access specific Amazon Web Services resources based on the role's
permissions. For more information about the SSR Compute role, see
Adding an SSR Compute role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-SSR-compute-role.html)
in the I<Amplify User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreateTime => Str

A timestamp of when Amplify created the application.


=head2 CustomHeaders => Str

Describes the custom HTTP headers for the Amplify app.


=head2 CustomRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Amplify::CustomRule>]

Describes the custom redirect and rewrite rules for the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DefaultDomain => Str

The default domain for the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

The description for the Amplify app.


=head2 EnableAutoBranchCreation => Bool

Enables automated branch creation for the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableBasicAuth => Bool

Enables basic authorization for the Amplify app's branches.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableBranchAutoBuild => Bool

Enables the auto-building of branches for the Amplify app.


=head2 EnableBranchAutoDeletion => Bool

Automatically disconnect a branch in the Amplify console when you
delete a branch from your Git repository.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnvironmentVariables => L<Paws::Amplify::EnvironmentVariables>

The environment variables for the Amplify app.

For a list of the environment variables that are accessible to Amplify
by default, see Amplify Environment variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-console-environment-variables.html)
in the I<Amplify Hosting User Guide>.


=head2 IamServiceRoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM service role for the Amplify
app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name for the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Platform => Str

The platform for the Amplify app. For a static app, set the platform
type to C<WEB>. For a dynamic server-side rendered (SSR) app, set the
platform type to C<WEB_COMPUTE>. For an app requiring Amplify Hosting's
original SSR support only, set the platform type to C<WEB_DYNAMIC>.

If you are deploying an SSG only app with Next.js 14 or later, you must
use the platform type C<WEB_COMPUTE>.


=head2 ProductionBranch => L<Paws::Amplify::ProductionBranch>

Describes the information about a production branch of the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Repository => Str

The Git repository for the Amplify app.


=head2 RepositoryCloneMethod => Str

This is for internal use.

The Amplify service uses this parameter to specify the authentication
protocol to use to access the Git repository for an Amplify app.
Amplify specifies C<TOKEN> for a GitHub repository, C<SIGV4> for an
Amazon Web Services CodeCommit repository, and C<SSH> for GitLab and
Bitbucket repositories.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Amplify::TagMap>

The tag for the Amplify app.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdateTime => Str

A timestamp of when Amplify updated the application.


=head2 WafConfiguration => L<Paws::Amplify::WafConfiguration>

Describes the Firewall configuration for the Amplify app. Firewall
support enables you to protect your hosted applications with a direct
integration with WAF.


=head2 WebhookCreateTime => Str

A timestamp of when Amplify created the webhook in your Git repository.
