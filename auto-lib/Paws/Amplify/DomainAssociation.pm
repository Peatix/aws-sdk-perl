=head1 NAME

Paws::Amplify::DomainAssociation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Amplify::DomainAssociation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoSubDomainCreationPatterns => $value, ..., UpdateStatus => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Amplify::DomainAssociation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoSubDomainCreationPatterns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the association between a custom domain and an Amplify app.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoSubDomainCreationPatterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Sets branch patterns for automatic subdomain creation.


=head2 AutoSubDomainIAMRole => Str

The required AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role for
the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for automatically creating subdomains.


=head2 Certificate => L<Paws::Amplify::Certificate>

Describes the SSL/TLS certificate for the domain association. This can
be your own custom certificate or the default certificate that Amplify
provisions for you.

If you are updating your domain to use a different certificate,
C<certificate> points to the new certificate that is being created
instead of the current active certificate. Otherwise, C<certificate>
points to the current active certificate.


=head2 CertificateVerificationDNSRecord => Str

The DNS record for certificate verification.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainAssociationArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the domain association.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainName => Str

The name of the domain.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DomainStatus => Str

The current status of the domain association.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EnableAutoSubDomain => Bool

Enables the automated creation of subdomains for branches.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StatusReason => Str

Additional information that describes why the domain association is in
the current state.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubDomains => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Amplify::SubDomain>]

The subdomains for the domain association.


=head2 UpdateStatus => Str

The status of the domain update operation that is currently in
progress. The following list describes the valid update states.

=over

=item REQUESTING_CERTIFICATE

The certificate is in the process of being updated.

=item PENDING_VERIFICATION

Indicates that an Amplify managed certificate is in the process of
being verified. This occurs during the creation of a custom domain or
when a custom domain is updated to use a managed certificate.

=item IMPORTING_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE

Indicates that an Amplify custom certificate is in the process of being
imported. This occurs during the creation of a custom domain or when a
custom domain is updated to use a custom certificate.

=item PENDING_DEPLOYMENT

Indicates that the subdomain or certificate changes are being
propagated.

=item AWAITING_APP_CNAME

Amplify is waiting for CNAME records corresponding to subdomains to be
propagated. If your custom domain is on Route 53, Amplify handles this
for you automatically. For more information about custom domains, see
Setting up custom domains
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html)
in the I<Amplify Hosting User Guide>.

=item UPDATE_COMPLETE

The certificate has been associated with a domain.

=item UPDATE_FAILED

The certificate has failed to be provisioned or associated, and there
is no existing active certificate to roll back to.
