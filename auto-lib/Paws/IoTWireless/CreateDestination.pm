=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::CreateDestination - Arguments for method CreateDestination on L<Paws::IoTWireless>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateDestination on the
L<AWS IoT Wireless|Paws::IoTWireless> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateDestination.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateDestination.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $api.iotwireless = Paws->service('IoTWireless');
    my $CreateDestinationResponse = $api . iotwireless->CreateDestination(
      Expression         => 'MyExpression',
      ExpressionType     => 'RuleName',
      Name               => 'MyDestinationName',
      RoleArn            => 'MyRoleArn',
      ClientRequestToken => 'MyClientRequestToken',    # OPTIONAL
      Description        => 'MyDescription',           # OPTIONAL
      Tags               => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Arn  = $CreateDestinationResponse->Arn;
    my $Name = $CreateDestinationResponse->Name;

    # Returns a L<Paws::IoTWireless::CreateDestinationResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ClientRequestToken => Str

Each resource must have a unique client request token. The client token
is used to implement idempotency. It ensures that the request completes
no more than one time. If you retry a request with the same token and
the same parameters, the request will complete successfully. However,
if you try to create a new resource using the same token but different
parameters, an HTTP 409 conflict occurs. If you omit this value, AWS
SDKs will automatically generate a unique client request. For more
information about idempotency, see Ensuring idempotency in Amazon EC2
API requests
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).



=head2 Description => Str

The description of the new resource.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Expression => Str

The rule name or topic rule to send messages to.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ExpressionType => Str

The type of value in C<Expression>.

Valid values are: C<"RuleName">, C<"MqttTopic">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the new resource.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The ARN of the IAM Role that authorizes the destination.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTWireless::Tag>]

The tags to attach to the new destination. Tags are metadata that you
can use to manage a resource.
