=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::Accuracy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::Accuracy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HorizontalAccuracy => $value, ..., VerticalAccuracy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::Accuracy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HorizontalAccuracy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The accuracy of the estimated position in meters. An empty value
indicates that no position data is available. A value of
E<lsquo>0.0E<rsquo> value indicates that position data is available.
This data corresponds to the position information that you specified
instead of the position computed by solver.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HorizontalAccuracy => Num

The horizontal accuracy of the estimated position, which is the
difference between the estimated location and the actual device
location.


=head2 VerticalAccuracy => Num

The vertical accuracy of the estimated position, which is the
difference between the estimated altitude and actual device latitude in
meters.
