=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGateways

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGateways object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DownlinkMode => $value, ..., TransmissionInterval => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGateways object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DownlinkMode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify the list of gateways to which you want to send downlink data
traffic when the wireless device is running in class B or class C mode.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DownlinkMode => Str

Indicates whether to send the downlink message in sequential mode or
concurrent mode, or to use only the chosen gateways from the previous
uplink message transmission.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GatewayList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTWireless::GatewayListItem>]

The list of gateways that you want to use for sending the downlink data
traffic.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TransmissionInterval => Int

The duration of time for which AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN will wait
before transmitting the payload to the next gateway.
