=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::GsmObj

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::GsmObj object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GeranCid => $value, ..., RxLevel => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::GsmObj object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GeranCid

=head1 DESCRIPTION

GSM object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> GeranCid => Int

GERAN (GSM EDGE Radio Access Network) Cell Global Identifier.


=head2 GsmLocalId => L<Paws::IoTWireless::GsmLocalId>

GSM local identification (local ID) information.


=head2 GsmNmr => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTWireless::GsmNmrObj>]

GSM object for network measurement reports.


=head2 GsmTimingAdvance => Int

Timing advance value, which corresponds to the length of time a signal
takes to reach the base station from a mobile phone.

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Mnc => Int

Mobile Network Code.


=head2 RxLevel => Int

Rx level, which is the received signal power, measured in dBm
(decibel-milliwatts).
