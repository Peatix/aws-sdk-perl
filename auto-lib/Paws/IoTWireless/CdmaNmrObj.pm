=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::CdmaNmrObj

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::CdmaNmrObj object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BaseStationId => $value, ..., PnOffset => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::CdmaNmrObj object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BaseStationId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CDMA object for network measurement reports.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BaseStationId => Int

CDMA base station ID (BSID).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CdmaChannel => Int

CDMA channel information.


=head2 PilotPower => Int

Transmit power level of the pilot signal, measured in dBm
(decibel-milliwatts).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PnOffset => Int

Pseudo-noise offset, which is a characteristic of the signal from a
cell on a radio tower.
