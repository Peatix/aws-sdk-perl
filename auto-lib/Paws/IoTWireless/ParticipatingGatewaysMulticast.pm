=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGatewaysMulticast

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGatewaysMulticast object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GatewayList => $value, ..., TransmissionInterval => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::ParticipatingGatewaysMulticast object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GatewayList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specify the list of gateways to which you want to send the multicast
downlink messages. The multicast message will be sent to each gateway
in the list, with the transmission interval as the time interval
between each message.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GatewayList => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The list of gateways that you want to use for sending the multicast
downlink message. Each downlink message will be sent to all the
gateways in the list in the order that you provided. If the gateway
list is empty, then AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN chooses the gateways that
were most recently used by the devices to send an uplink message.


=head2 TransmissionInterval => Int

The duration of time in milliseconds for which AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN
will wait before transmitting the multicast payload to the next gateway
in the list.
