=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::DakCertificateMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::DakCertificateMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApId => $value, ..., MaxAllowedSignature => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::DakCertificateMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The device attestation key (DAK) information.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApId => Str

The advertised product ID (APID) that's used for pre-production and
production applications.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CertificateId => Str

The certificate ID for the DAK.


=head2 DeviceTypeId => Str

The device type ID that's used for prototyping applications.


=head2 FactorySupport => Bool

Whether factory support has been enabled.


=head2 MaxAllowedSignature => Int

The maximum number of signatures that the DAK can sign. A value of
C<-1> indicates that there's no device limit.
