=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTWireless::TdscdmaNmrObj

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTWireless::TdscdmaNmrObj object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CellParams => $value, ..., UtranCid => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTWireless::TdscdmaNmrObj object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CellParams

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TD-SCDMA object for network measurement reports.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CellParams => Int

Cell parameters for TD-SCDMA network measurement reports object.


=head2 PathLoss => Int

Path loss, or path attenuation, is the reduction in power density of an
electromagnetic wave as it propagates through space.


=head2 Rscp => Int

Code power of the received signal, measured in decibel-milliwatts
(dBm).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Uarfcn => Int

TD-SCDMA UTRA (Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network) absolute RF
channel number.


=head2 UtranCid => Int

UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) cell global identifier.
