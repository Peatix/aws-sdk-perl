=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ContainerPortConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ContainerPortConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerPortRanges => $value, ..., ContainerPortRanges => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ContainerPortConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerPortRanges

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of port ranges that can be opened on the container. A process
that's running in the container can bind to a port number, making it
accessible to inbound traffic. Container ports map to a container
fleet's connection ports.
