=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LocationOrder => $value, ..., PriorityOrder => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LocationOrder

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Custom prioritization settings to use with a game session queue.
Prioritization settings determine how the queue selects a game hosting
resource to start a new game session. This configuration replaces the
default prioritization process for queues.

By default, a queue makes game session placements based on the
following criteria:

=over

=item *

When a game session request does not include player latency data,
Amazon GameLift places game sessions based on the following priorities:
(1) the queue's default destination order, and (2) for multi-location
fleets, an alphabetic list of locations.

=item *

When a game session request includes player latency data, Amazon
GameLift re-orders the queue's destinations to make placements where
the average player latency is lowest. It reorders based the following
priorities: (1) the lowest average latency across all players, (2) the
lowest hosting cost, (3) the queue's default destination order, and (4)
for multi-location fleets, an alphabetic list of locations.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LocationOrder => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The prioritization order to use for fleet locations, when the
C<PriorityOrder> property includes C<LOCATION>. Locations can include
Amazon Web Services Region codes (such as C<us-west-2>), local zones,
and custom locations (for Anywhere fleets). Each location must be
listed only once. For details, see Amazon GameLift service locations.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-regions.html)


=head2 PriorityOrder => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A custom sequence to use when prioritizing where to place new game
sessions. Each priority type is listed once.

=over

=item *

C<LATENCY> -- Amazon GameLift prioritizes locations where the average
player latency is lowest. Player latency data is provided in each game
session placement request.

=item *

C<COST> -- Amazon GameLift prioritizes queue destinations with the
lowest current hosting costs. Cost is evaluated based on the
destination's location, instance type, and fleet type (Spot or
On-Demand).

=item *

C<DESTINATION> -- Amazon GameLift prioritizes based on the list order
of destinations in the queue configuration.

=item *

C<LOCATION> -- Amazon GameLift prioritizes based on the provided order
of locations, as defined in C<LocationOrder>.
