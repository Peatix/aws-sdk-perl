=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ContainerHealthCheck

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ContainerHealthCheck object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., Timeout => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ContainerHealthCheck object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instructions on when and how to check the health of a support container
in a container fleet. These properties override any Docker health
checks that are set in the container image. For more information on
container health checks, see HealthCheck command
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheck.html#ECS-Type-HealthCheck-command)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service API>. Game server containers
don't have a health check parameter; Amazon GameLift automatically
handles health checks for these containers.

The following example instructs the container to initiate a health
check command every 60 seconds and wait 10 seconds for it to succeed.
If it fails, retry the command 3 times before flagging the container as
unhealthy. It also tells the container to wait 100 seconds after launch
before counting failed health checks.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A string array that specifies the command that the container runs to
determine if it's healthy.


=head2 Interval => Int

The time period (in seconds) between each health check.


=head2 Retries => Int

The number of times to retry a failed health check before flagging the
container unhealthy. The first run of the command does not count as a
retry.


=head2 StartPeriod => Int

The optional grace period (in seconds) to give a container time to
bootstrap before the first failed health check counts toward the number
of retries.


=head2 Timeout => Int

The time period (in seconds) to wait for a health check to succeed
before counting a failed health check.
