=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ContainerGroupDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ContainerGroupDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerGroupDefinitionArn => $value, ..., VersionNumber => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ContainerGroupDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerGroupDefinitionArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The properties that describe a container group resource. You can update
all properties of a container group definition properties. Updates to a
container group definition are saved as new versions.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerGroupDefinitionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to an Amazon GameLift C<ContainerGroupDefinition>
resource. It uniquely identifies the resource across all Amazon Web
Services Regions. Format is
C<arn:aws:gamelift:[region]::containergroupdefinition/[container group
definition name]:[version]>.


=head2 ContainerGroupType => Str

The type of container group. Container group type determines how Amazon
GameLift deploys the container group on each fleet instance.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a
number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 GameServerContainerDefinition => L<Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerDefinition>

The definition for the game server container in this group. This
property is used only when the container group type is C<GAME_SERVER>.
This container definition specifies a container image with the game
server build.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A descriptive identifier for the container group definition. The name
value is unique in an Amazon Web Services Region.


=head2 OperatingSystem => Str

The platform that all containers in the container group definition run
on.

Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) will reach end of support on 6/30/2025. See more
details in the Amazon Linux 2 FAQs
(https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/faqs/). For game servers that
are hosted on AL2 and use server SDK version 4.x for Amazon GameLift,
first update the game server build to server SDK 5.x, and then deploy
to AL2023 instances. See Migrate to server SDK version 5.
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-serversdk5-migration.html)


=head2 Status => Str

Current status of the container group definition resource. Values
include:

=over

=item *

C<COPYING> -- Amazon GameLift is in the process of making copies of all
container images that are defined in the group. While in this state,
the resource can't be used to create a container fleet.

=item *

C<READY> -- Amazon GameLift has copied the registry images for all
containers that are defined in the group. You can use a container group
definition in this status to create a container fleet.

=item *

C<FAILED> -- Amazon GameLift failed to create a valid container group
definition resource. For more details on the cause of the failure, see
C<StatusReason>. A container group definition resource in failed status
will be deleted within a few minutes.

=back



=head2 StatusReason => Str

Additional information about a container group definition that's in
C<FAILED> status. Possible reasons include:

=over

=item *

An internal issue prevented Amazon GameLift from creating the container
group definition resource. Delete the failed resource and call
CreateContainerGroupDefinition
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html)again.

=item *

An access-denied message means that you don't have permissions to
access the container image on ECR. See IAM permission examples
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-iam-policy-examples.html.html)
for help setting up required IAM permissions for Amazon GameLift.

=item *

The C<ImageUri> value for at least one of the containers in the
container group definition was invalid or not found in the current
Amazon Web Services account.

=item *

At least one of the container images referenced in the container group
definition exceeds the allowed size. For size limits, see Amazon
GameLift endpoints and quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/gamelift.html).

=item *

At least one of the container images referenced in the container group
definition uses a different operating system than the one defined for
the container group.

=back



=head2 SupportContainerDefinitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::SupportContainerDefinition>]

The set of definitions for support containers in this group. A
container group definition might have zero support container
definitions. Support container can be used in any type of container
group.


=head2 TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes => Int

The amount of memory (in MiB) on a fleet instance to allocate for the
container group. All containers in the group share these resources.

You can set a limit for each container definition in the group. If
individual containers have limits, this total value must be greater
than any individual container's memory limit.


=head2 TotalVcpuLimit => Num

The amount of vCPU units on a fleet instance to allocate for the
container group (1 vCPU is equal to 1024 CPU units). All containers in
the group share these resources. You can set a limit for each container
definition in the group. If individual containers have limits, this
total value must be equal to or greater than the sum of the limits for
each container in the group.


=head2 VersionDescription => Str

An optional description that was provided for a container group
definition update. Each version can have a unique description.


=head2 VersionNumber => Int

Indicates the version of a particular container group definition. This
number is incremented automatically when you update a container group
definition. You can view, update, or delete individual versions or the
entire container group definition.
