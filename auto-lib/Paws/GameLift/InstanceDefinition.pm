=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::InstanceDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::InstanceDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstanceType => $value, ..., WeightedCapacity => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::InstanceDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstanceType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and game
server groups.>

An allowed instance type for a game server group. All game server
groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. Amazon
GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for
viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of
viable instance types.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

An Amazon EC2 instance type designation.


=head2 WeightedCapacity => Str

Instance weighting that indicates how much this instance type
contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance
weights are used by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance
type's cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective
options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see
Instance Weighting
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide>. Default
value is "1".
