=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerName => $value, ..., ServerSdkVersion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the game server container in an existing game server
container group. A game server container identifies a container image
with your game server build. A game server container is automatically
considered essential; if an essential container fails, the entire
container group restarts.

You can update a container definition and deploy the updates to an
existing fleet. When creating or updating a game server container group
definition, use the property
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameServerContainerDefinitionInput
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameServerContainerDefinitionInput).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerName => Str

The container definition identifier. Container names are unique within
a container group definition.


=head2 DependsOn => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerDependency>]

Indicates that the container relies on the status of other containers
in the same container group during startup and shutdown sequences. A
container might have dependencies on multiple containers.


=head2 EnvironmentOverride => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerEnvironment>]

A set of environment variables that's passed to the container on
startup. See the ContainerDefinition::environment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html#ECS-Type-ContainerDefinition-environment)
parameter in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference>.


=head2 ImageUri => Str

The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift uses when deploying this
container to a container fleet. For a more specific identifier, see
C<ResolvedImageDigest>.


=head2 MountPoints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerMountPoint>]

A mount point that binds a path inside the container to a file or
directory on the host system and lets it access the file or directory.


=head2 PortConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerPortConfiguration>

The set of ports that are available to bind to processes in the
container. For example, a game server process requires a container port
to allow game clients to connect to it. Container ports aren't directly
accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon GameLift maps these container ports
to externally accessible connection ports, which are assigned as needed
from the container fleet's C<ConnectionPortRange>.


=head2 ResolvedImageDigest => Str

A unique and immutable identifier for the container image. The digest
is a SHA 256 hash of the container image manifest.


=head2 ServerSdkVersion => Str

The Amazon GameLift server SDK version that the game server is
integrated with. Only game servers using 5.2.0 or higher are compatible
with container fleets.
