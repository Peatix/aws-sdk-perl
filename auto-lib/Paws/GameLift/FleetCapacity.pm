=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::FleetCapacity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::FleetCapacity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FleetArn => $value, ..., Location => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::FleetCapacity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FleetArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Current resource capacity settings for managed EC2 fleets and managed
container fleets. For multi-location fleets, location values might
refer to a fleet's remote location or its home Region.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FleetArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift fleet resource and uniquely
identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
C<arn:aws:gamelift:E<lt>regionE<gt>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912>.


=head2 FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the fleet associated with the location.


=head2 GameServerContainerGroupCounts => L<Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerGroupCounts>

The number and status of game server container groups deployed in a
container fleet.


=head2 InstanceCounts => L<Paws::GameLift::EC2InstanceCounts>

The current number of instances in the fleet, listed by instance
status. Counts for pending and terminating instances might be non-zero
if the fleet is adjusting to a scaling event or if access to resources
is temporarily affected.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type that is used for instances in a fleet.
Instance type determines the computing resources in use, including CPU,
memory, storage, and networking capacity. See Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud Instance Types (http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for
detailed descriptions.


=head2 Location => Str

The fleet location for the instance count information, expressed as an
Amazon Web Services Region code, such as C<us-west-2>.
