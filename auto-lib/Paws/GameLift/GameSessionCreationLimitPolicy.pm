  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NewGameSessionsPerCreator => $value, ..., PolicyPeriodInMinutes => $value  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A policy that puts limits on the number of game sessions that a player
can create within a specified span of time. With this policy, you can
control players' ability to consume available resources.

The policy is evaluated when a player tries to create a new game
session. On receiving a C<CreateGameSession> request, Amazon GameLift
checks that the player (identified by C<CreatorId>) has created fewer
than game session limit in the specified time period.
