=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ClaimGameServer - Arguments for method ClaimGameServer on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ClaimGameServer on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ClaimGameServer.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ClaimGameServer.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $ClaimGameServerOutput = $gamelift->ClaimGameServer(
      GameServerGroupName => 'MyGameServerGroupNameOrArn',
      FilterOption        => {
        InstanceStatuses => [
          'ACTIVE', ...    # values: ACTIVE, DRAINING
        ],    # OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      GameServerData => 'MyGameServerData',    # OPTIONAL
      GameServerId   => 'MyGameServerId',      # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameServer = $ClaimGameServerOutput->GameServer;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::ClaimGameServerOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/gamelift/ClaimGameServer>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FilterOption => L<Paws::GameLift::ClaimFilterOption>

Object that restricts how a claimed game server is chosen.



=head2 GameServerData => Str

A set of custom game server properties, formatted as a single string
value. This data is passed to a game client or service when it requests
information on game servers.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> GameServerGroupName => Str

A unique identifier for the game server group where the game server is
running. If you are not specifying a game server to claim, this value
identifies where you want Amazon GameLift FleetIQ to look for an
available game server to claim.



=head2 GameServerId => Str

A custom string that uniquely identifies the game server to claim. If
this parameter is left empty, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ searches for an
available game server in the specified game server group.
