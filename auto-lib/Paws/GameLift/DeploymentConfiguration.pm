=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::DeploymentConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::DeploymentConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ImpairmentStrategy => $value, ..., ProtectionStrategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::DeploymentConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ImpairmentStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set of rules for processing a deployment for a container fleet update.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ImpairmentStrategy => Str

Determines what actions to take if a deployment fails. If the fleet is
multi-location, this strategy applies across all fleet locations. With
a rollback strategy, updated fleet instances are rolled back to the
last successful deployment. Alternatively, you can maintain a few
impaired containers for the purpose of debugging, while all other tasks
return to the last successful deployment.


=head2 MinimumHealthyPercentage => Int

Sets a minimum level of healthy tasks to maintain during deployment
activity.


=head2 ProtectionStrategy => Str

Determines how fleet deployment activity affects active game sessions
on the fleet. With protection, a deployment honors game session
protection, and delays actions that would interrupt a protected active
game session until the game session ends. Without protection,
deployment activity can shut down all running tasks, including active
game sessions, regardless of game session protection.
