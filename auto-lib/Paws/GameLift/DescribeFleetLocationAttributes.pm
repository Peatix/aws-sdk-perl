=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::DescribeFleetLocationAttributes - Arguments for method DescribeFleetLocationAttributes on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeFleetLocationAttributes on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeFleetLocationAttributes.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeFleetLocationAttributes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput =
      $gamelift->DescribeFleetLocationAttributes(
      FleetId   => 'MyFleetIdOrArn',
      Limit     => 1,                  # OPTIONAL
      Locations => [
        'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      NextToken => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
      );

    # Results:
    my $FleetArn = $DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput->FleetArn;
    my $FleetId  = $DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput->FleetId;
    my $LocationAttributes =
      $DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput->LocationAttributes;
    my $NextToken = $DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::DescribeFleetLocationAttributesOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve remote locations for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.



=head2 Limit => Int

The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
C<NextToken> to get results as a set of sequential pages. This limit is
not currently enforced.



=head2 Locations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of fleet locations to retrieve information for. Specify
locations in the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code, such as
C<us-west-2>.



=head2 NextToken => Str

A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of
results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this
operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify
a value.
