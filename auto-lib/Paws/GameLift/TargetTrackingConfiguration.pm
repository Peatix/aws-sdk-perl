=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<This data type is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and game
server groups.>

Settings for a target-based scaling policy as part of a
GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy.html)
. These settings are used to create a target-based policy that tracks
the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ metric C<"PercentUtilizedGameServers"> and
specifies a target value for the metric. As player usage changes, the
policy triggers to adjust the game server group capacity so that the
metric returns to the target value.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TargetValue => Num

policy.
