=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ContainerFleet

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ContainerFleet object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BillingType => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ContainerFleet object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BillingType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an Amazon GameLift managed container fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BillingType => Str

Indicates whether the fleet uses On-Demand or Spot instances for this
fleet. Learn more about when to use On-Demand versus Spot Instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot).
You can't update this fleet property.

By default, this property is set to C<ON_DEMAND>.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a
number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 DeploymentDetails => L<Paws::GameLift::DeploymentDetails>

Information about the most recent deployment for the container fleet.


=head2 Description => Str

A meaningful description of the container fleet.


=head2 FleetArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift fleet resource and uniquely
identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
C<arn:aws:gamelift:E<lt>regionE<gt>::fleet/fleet-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912>.
In a GameLift fleet ARN, the resource ID matches the C<FleetId> value.


=head2 FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the container fleet to retrieve.


=head2 FleetRoleArn => Str

The unique identifier for an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role
with permissions to run your containers on resources that are managed
by Amazon GameLift. See Set up an IAM service role
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/setting-up-role.html).
This fleet property can't be changed.


=head2 GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to the fleet's game server container group. The ARN
value also identifies the specific container group definition version
in use.


=head2 GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName => Str

The name of the fleet's game server container group definition, which
describes how to deploy containers with your game server build and
support software onto each fleet instance.


=head2 GameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance => Int

The number of times to replicate the game server container group on
each fleet instance.


=head2 GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy => L<Paws::GameLift::GameSessionCreationLimitPolicy>

A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual
player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a
specified span of time.


=head2 InstanceConnectionPortRange => L<Paws::GameLift::ConnectionPortRange>




=head2 InstanceInboundPermissions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::IpPermission>]

The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to
access game server processes and other processes on this fleet.


=head2 InstanceType => Str

The Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all instances in the fleet.
Instance type determines the computing resources and processing power
that's available to host your game servers. This includes including
CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. You can't update this
fleet property.


=head2 LocationAttributes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerFleetLocationAttributes>]

Information about the container fleet's remote locations where fleet
instances are deployed.


=head2 LogConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::LogConfiguration>

The method that is used to collect container logs for the fleet. Amazon
GameLift saves all standard output for each container in logs,
including game session logs.

=over

=item *

C<CLOUDWATCH> -- Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you
define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the
log group.

=item *

C<S3> -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.

=item *

C<NONE> -- Don't collect container logs.

=back



=head2 MaximumGameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance => Int

The calculated maximum number of game server container group that can
be deployed on each fleet instance. The calculation depends on the
resource needs of the container group and the CPU and memory resources
of the fleet's instance type.


=head2 MetricGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add this
fleet to. Metric groups aggregate metrics for multiple fleets.


=head2 NewGameSessionProtectionPolicy => Str

Determines whether Amazon GameLift can shut down game sessions on the
fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift
might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or
when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session
protection for individual game sessions using UpdateGameSession.

=over

=item *

B<NoProtection> -- Game sessions can be shut down during active
gameplay.

=item *

B<FullProtection> -- Game sessions in C<ACTIVE> status can't be shut
down.

=back



=head2 PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to the fleet's per-instance container group. The ARN
value also identifies the specific container group definition version
in use.


=head2 PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName => Str

The name of the fleet's per-instance container group definition.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status of the container fleet.

=over

=item *

C<PENDING> -- A new container fleet has been requested.

=item *

C<CREATING> -- A new container fleet resource is being created.

=item *

C<CREATED> -- A new container fleet resource has been created. No fleet
instances have been deployed.

=item *

C<ACTIVATING> -- New container fleet instances are being deployed.

=item *

C<ACTIVE> -- The container fleet has been deployed and is ready to host
game sessions.

=item *

C<UPDATING> -- Updates to the container fleet is being updated. A
deployment is in progress.

=back
