=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::IpPermission

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::IpPermission object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FromPort => $value, ..., ToPort => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::IpPermission object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FromPort

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A range of IP addresses and port settings that allow inbound traffic to
connect to processes on an instance in a fleet. Processes are assigned
an IP address/port number combination, which must fall into the fleet's
allowed ranges.

For Amazon GameLift Realtime fleets, Amazon GameLift automatically
opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FromPort => Int

A starting value for a range of allowed port numbers.

For fleets using Linux builds, only ports C<22> and C<1026-60000> are
valid.

For fleets using Windows builds, only ports C<1026-60000> are valid.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IpRange => Str

A range of allowed IP addresses. This value must be expressed in CIDR
notation. Example: "C<000.000.000.000/[subnet mask]>" or optionally the
shortened version "C<0.0.0.0/[subnet mask]>".


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Protocol => Str

The network communication protocol used by the fleet.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ToPort => Int

An ending value for a range of allowed port numbers. Port numbers are
end-inclusive. This value must be equal to or greater than C<FromPort>.

For fleets using Linux builds, only ports C<22> and C<1026-60000> are
valid.

For fleets using Windows builds, only ports C<1026-60000> are valid.
