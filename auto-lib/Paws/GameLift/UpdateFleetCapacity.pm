=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::UpdateFleetCapacity - Arguments for method UpdateFleetCapacity on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateFleetCapacity on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateFleetCapacity.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateFleetCapacity.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $UpdateFleetCapacityOutput = $gamelift->UpdateFleetCapacity(
      FleetId          => 'MyFleetIdOrArn',
      DesiredInstances => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      Location         => 'MyLocationStringModel',    # OPTIONAL
      MaxSize          => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      MinSize          => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $FleetArn = $UpdateFleetCapacityOutput->FleetArn;
    my $FleetId  = $UpdateFleetCapacityOutput->FleetId;
    my $Location = $UpdateFleetCapacityOutput->Location;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::UpdateFleetCapacityOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DesiredInstances => Int

The number of Amazon EC2 instances you want to maintain in the

maximum size limits. Changes in desired instance value can take up to 1
minute to be reflected when viewing the fleet's capacity settings.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the fleet to update capacity settings for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.



=head2 Location => Str

The name of a remote location to update fleet capacity settings for, in
the form of an Amazon Web Services Region code such as C<us-west-2>.



=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet
location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.



=head2 MinSize => Int

The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet
location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.
