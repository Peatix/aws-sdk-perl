=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::FleetDeployment

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::FleetDeployment object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., RollbackPerInstanceBinaryArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::FleetDeployment object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a container fleet deployment with updates to the fleet.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a
number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 DeploymentConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::DeploymentConfiguration>

Instructions for how to deploy updates to a container fleet and what
actions to take if the deployment fails.


=head2 DeploymentId => Str

A unique identifier for the deployment.


=head2 DeploymentStatus => Str

The status of fleet deployment activity in the location.

=over

=item *

C<IN_PROGRESS> -- The deployment is in progress.

=item *

C<IMPAIRED> -- The deployment failed and the fleet has some impaired
containers.

=item *

C<COMPLETE> -- The deployment has completed successfully.

=item *

C<ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS> -- The deployment failed and rollback has been
initiated.

=item *

C<ROLLBACK_IN_COMPLETE> -- The deployment failed and rollback has been
completed.

=item *

C<CANCELLED> -- The deployment was cancelled.

=back



=head2 FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the container fleet.


=head2 GameServerBinaryArn => Str

The unique identifier for the version of the game server container
group definition that is being deployed.


=head2 PerInstanceBinaryArn => Str

The unique identifier for the version of the per-instance container
group definition that is being deployed.


=head2 RollbackGameServerBinaryArn => Str

The unique identifier for the version of the game server container
group definition to roll back to if deployment fails. Amazon GameLift
sets this property to the container group definition version that the
fleet used when it was last active.


=head2 RollbackPerInstanceBinaryArn => Str

The unique identifier for the version of the per-instance container
group definition to roll back to if deployment fails. Amazon GameLift
sets this property to the container group definition version that the
fleet used when it was last active.
