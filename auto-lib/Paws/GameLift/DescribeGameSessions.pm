=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::DescribeGameSessions - Arguments for method DescribeGameSessions on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DescribeGameSessions on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DescribeGameSessions.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DescribeGameSessions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $DescribeGameSessionsOutput = $gamelift->DescribeGameSessions(
      AliasId       => 'MyAliasIdOrArn',           # OPTIONAL
      FleetId       => 'MyFleetIdOrArn',           # OPTIONAL
      GameSessionId => 'MyArnStringModel',         # OPTIONAL
      Limit         => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      Location      => 'MyLocationStringModel',    # OPTIONAL
      NextToken     => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
      StatusFilter  => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameSessions = $DescribeGameSessionsOutput->GameSessions;
    my $NextToken    = $DescribeGameSessionsOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::DescribeGameSessionsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head2 AliasId => Str

A unique identifier for the alias associated with the fleet to retrieve
game sessions for. You can use either the alias ID or ARN value.



=head2 FleetId => Str

A unique identifier for the fleet to retrieve game sessions for. You
can use either the fleet ID or ARN value.



=head2 GameSessionId => Str

A unique identifier for the game session to retrieve.



=head2 Limit => Int

The maximum number of results to return. Use this parameter with
C<NextToken> to get results as a set of sequential pages.



=head2 Location => Str

A fleet location to get game sessions for. You can specify a fleet's
home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region
code format, such as C<us-west-2>.



=head2 NextToken => Str

A token that indicates the start of the next sequential page of
results. Use the token that is returned with a previous call to this
operation. To start at the beginning of the result set, do not specify
a value.



=head2 StatusFilter => Str

Game session status to filter results on. You can filter on the
following states: C<ACTIVE>, C<TERMINATED>, C<ACTIVATING>, and
C<TERMINATING>. The last two are transitory and used for only very
brief periods of time.
