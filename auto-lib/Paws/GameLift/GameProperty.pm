=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::GameProperty

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::GameProperty object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Key => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::GameProperty object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Key

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This key-value pair can store custom data about a game session. For
example, you might use a C<GameProperty> to track a game session's map,
level of difficulty, or remaining time. The difficulty level could be
specified like this: C<{"Key": "difficulty", "Value":"Novice"}>.

You can set game properties when creating a game session. You can also
modify game properties of an active game session. When searching for
game sessions, you can filter on game property keys and values. You
can't delete game properties from a game session.

For examples of working with game properties, see Create a game session
with properties
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-client-api.html#game-properties).
