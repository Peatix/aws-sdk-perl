=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::Script

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::Script object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreationTime => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::Script object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreationTime

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Properties describing a Realtime script.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a
number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 Name => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do
not need to be unique.


=head2 ScriptArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift script resource and uniquely
identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. In a GameLift script
ARN, the resource ID matches the I<ScriptId> value.


=head2 ScriptId => Str

A unique identifier for the Realtime script


=head2 SizeOnDisk => Int

The file size of the uploaded Realtime script, expressed in bytes. When
files are uploaded from an S3 location, this value remains at "0".


=head2 StorageLocation => L<Paws::GameLift::S3Location>

The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing
your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the
Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN
that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location.
The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new
script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the
zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the
C<ObjectVersion> parameter to specify an earlier version.


=head2 Version => Str

Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version
strings do not need to be unique.
