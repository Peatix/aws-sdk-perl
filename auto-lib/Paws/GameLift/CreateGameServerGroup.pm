Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingPolicy => L<Paws::GameLift::GameServerGroupAutoScalingPolicy>

Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling
group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the
metric C<"PercentUtilizedGameServers"> to maintain a buffer of idle
game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players.
After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in
the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.



=head2 BalancingStrategy => Str

Indicates how Amazon GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot
Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method
options include the following:

=over

=item *

C<SPOT_ONLY> - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group.
If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the
game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can
again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the
existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current
gameplay ends) and are not replaced.

=item *

C<SPOT_PREFERRED> - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever
available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable,
the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling
back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are
terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new
On-Demand Instances.

=item *

C<ON_DEMAND_ONLY> - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game
server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while
this balancing strategy is in force.

=back


Valid values are: C<"SPOT_ONLY">, C<"SPOT_PREFERRED">, C<"ON_DEMAND_ONLY">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> GameServerGroupName => Str

An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to
generate unique ARN identifiers for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group
and the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be
unique per Region per Amazon Web Services account.



=head2 GameServerProtectionPolicy => Str

A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are
protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have
active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down
event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances
cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except
in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An
exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by
Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is
set to C<NO_PROTECTION> by default.

Valid values are: C<"NO_PROTECTION">, C<"FULL_PROTECTION">

=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceDefinitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::InstanceDefinition>]

The Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling
group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different
instance types that are supported by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ. For more
information on instance types, see EC2 Instance Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide>. You can optionally
specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value
is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1".
For more information about capacity weighting, see Instance Weighting
for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-instance-weighting.html)
in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::GameLift::LaunchTemplateSpecification>

The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and
game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server
group. You can specify the template using either the template name or
ID. For help with creating a launch template, see Creating a Launch
Template for an Auto Scaling Group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide>. After
the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the
Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.

If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must
explicitly set the property C<AssociatePublicIpAddress> to "true". If
no network interface is specified in the launch template, Amazon
GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaxSize => Int

The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and EC2
do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling
group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group
using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinSize => Int

The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and
Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In
production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto
Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto
Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2
Auto Scaling groups.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::Tag>]

A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags
are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services
resources is useful for resource management, access management, and
cost allocation. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.



=head2 VpcSubnets => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in
the game server group. By default, all Amazon GameLift
FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this
parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be
updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding
Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with
this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.
