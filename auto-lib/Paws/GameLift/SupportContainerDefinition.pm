=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::SupportContainerDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::SupportContainerDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContainerName => $value, ..., Vcpu => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::SupportContainerDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContainerName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a support container in a container group. A support container
might be in a game server container group or a per-instance container
group. Support containers don't run game server processes.

You can update a support container definition and deploy the updates to
an existing fleet. When creating or updating a game server container
group definition, use the property GameServerContainerDefinitionInput
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameServerContainerDefinitionInput.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContainerName => Str

The container definition identifier. Container names are unique within
a container group definition.


=head2 DependsOn => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerDependency>]

Indicates that the container relies on the status of other containers
in the same container group during its startup and shutdown sequences.
A container might have dependencies on multiple containers.


=head2 EnvironmentOverride => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerEnvironment>]

A set of environment variables that's passed to the container on
startup. See the ContainerDefinition::environment
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_ContainerDefinition.html#ECS-Type-ContainerDefinition-environment)
parameter in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service API Reference>.


=head2 Essential => Bool

Indicates whether the container is vital to the container group. If an
essential container fails, the entire container group restarts.


=head2 HealthCheck => L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerHealthCheck>

A configuration for a non-terminal health check. A support container
automatically restarts if it stops functioning or if it fails this
health check.


=head2 ImageUri => Str

The URI to the image that Amazon GameLift deploys to a container fleet.
For a more specific identifier, see C<ResolvedImageDigest>.


=head2 MemoryHardLimitMebibytes => Int

The amount of memory that Amazon GameLift makes available to the
container. If memory limits aren't set for an individual container, the
container shares the container group's total memory allocation.

TotalMemoryLimitMebibytes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_ContainerGroupDefinition.html)


=head2 MountPoints => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerMountPoint>]

A mount point that binds a path inside the container to a file or
directory on the host system and lets it access the file or directory.


=head2 PortConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::ContainerPortConfiguration>

A set of ports that allow access to the container from external users.
Processes running in the container can bind to a one of these ports.
Container ports aren't directly accessed by inbound traffic. Amazon
GameLift maps these container ports to externally accessible connection
ports, which are assigned as needed from the container fleet's
C<ConnectionPortRange>.


=head2 ResolvedImageDigest => Str

A unique and immutable identifier for the container image. The digest
is a SHA 256 hash of the container image manifest.


=head2 Vcpu => Num

The number of vCPU units that are reserved for the container. If no
resources are reserved, the container shares the total vCPU limit for
the container group.
