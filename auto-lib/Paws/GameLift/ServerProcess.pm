=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConcurrentExecutions => $value, ..., Parameters => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::ServerProcess object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConcurrentExecutions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A set of instructions for launching server processes on fleet computes.
Server processes run either an executable in a custom game build or a
Amazon GameLift Realtime script. Server process configurations are part
of a fleet's runtime configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConcurrentExecutions => Int

The number of server processes using this configuration that run
concurrently on each instance or compute.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LaunchPath => Str

The location of a game build executable or Realtime script. Game builds
and Realtime scripts are installed on instances at the root:

=over

=item *

Windows (custom game builds only): C<C:\game>. Example:
"C<C:\game\MyGame\server.exe>"

=item *

Linux: C</local/game>. Examples: "C</local/game/MyGame/server.exe>" or
"C</local/game/MyRealtimeScript.js>"

=back

Amazon GameLift doesn't support the use of setup scripts that launch
the game executable. For custom game builds, this parameter must
indicate the executable that calls the server SDK operations
C<initSDK()> and C<ProcessReady()>.


=head2 Parameters => Str

An optional list of parameters to pass to the server executable or
Realtime script on launch.
