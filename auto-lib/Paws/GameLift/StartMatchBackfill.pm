=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $StartMatchBackfillOutput = $gamelift->StartMatchBackfill(
      ConfigurationName => 'MyMatchmakingConfigurationName',
      Players           => [
        {
          LatencyInMs => {
            'MyNonEmptyString' => 1,    # key: min: 1, value: min: 1
          },    # OPTIONAL
          PlayerAttributes => {
            'MyNonZeroAndMaxString' => {
              N   => 1,                            # OPTIONAL
              S   => 'MyPlayerAttributeString',    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
              SDM => {
                'MyPlayerAttributeString' =>
                  1,    # key: min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL, value: OPTIONAL
              },    # OPTIONAL
              SL => [
                'MyPlayerAttributeString', ...    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
              ],    # OPTIONAL
            },    # key: min: 1, max: 1024
          },    # OPTIONAL
          PlayerId => 'MyPlayerId',               # min: 1, max: 1024; OPTIONAL
          Team     => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # min: 1, max: 1024
        },
        ...
      ],
      GameSessionArn => 'MyArnStringModel',              # OPTIONAL
      TicketId       => 'MyMatchmakingIdStringModel',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $MatchmakingTicket = $StartMatchBackfillOutput->MatchmakingTicket;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::StartMatchBackfillOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ConfigurationName => Str

Name of the matchmaker to use for this request. You can use either the
configuration name or ARN value. The ARN of the matchmaker that was
used with the original game session is listed in the C<GameSession>
object, C<MatchmakerData> property.



=head2 GameSessionArn => Str

A unique identifier for the game session. Use the game session ID. When
using FlexMatch as a standalone matchmaking solution, this parameter is
not needed.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Players => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::Player>]

Match information on all players that are currently assigned to the
game session. This information is used by the matchmaker to find new
players and add them to the existing game.

You can include up to 199 C<Players> in a C<StartMatchBackfill>
request.

=over

=item *

PlayerID, PlayerAttributes, Team -- This information is maintained in
the C<GameSession> object, C<MatchmakerData> property, for all players
who are currently assigned to the game session. The matchmaker data is
in JSON syntax, formatted as a string. For more details, see Match Data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data).

The backfill request must specify the team membership for every player.
Do not specify team if you are not using backfill.

=item *

LatencyInMs -- If the matchmaker uses player latency, include a latency
value, in milliseconds, for the Region that the game session is
currently in. Do not include latency values for any other Region.

=back




=head2 TicketId => Str

A unique identifier for a matchmaking ticket. If no ticket ID is
specified here, Amazon GameLift will generate one in the form of a
UUID. Use this identifier to track the match backfill ticket status and
retrieve match results.
