=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $ListGameServerGroupsOutput = $gamelift->ListGameServerGroups(
      Limit     => 1,                          # OPTIONAL
      NextToken => 'MyNonZeroAndMaxString',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameServerGroups = $ListGameServerGroupsOutput->GameServerGroups;
    my $NextToken        = $ListGameServerGroupsOutput->NextToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::ListGameServerGroupsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
