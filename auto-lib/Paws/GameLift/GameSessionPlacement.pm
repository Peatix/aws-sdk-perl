=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::GameSessionPlacement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::GameSessionPlacement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DnsName => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::GameSessionPlacement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DnsName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a potential game session placement, including the full
details of the original placement request and the current status.

If the game session placement status is C<PENDING>, the properties for
game session ID/ARN, region, IP address/DNS, and port aren't final. A
game session is not active and ready to accept players until placement
status reaches C<FULFILLED>. When the placement is in C<PENDING>
status, Amazon GameLift may attempt to place a game session multiple
times before succeeding. With each attempt it creates a
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameSession
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameSession)
object and updates this placement object with the new game session
properties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DnsName => Str

The DNS identifier assigned to the instance that is running the game
session. Values have the following format:

=over

=item *

TLS-enabled fleets: C<E<lt>unique identifierE<gt>.E<lt>region
identifierE<gt>.amazongamelift.com>.

=item *

Non-TLS-enabled fleets: C<ec2-E<lt>unique
identifierE<gt>.compute.amazonaws.com>. (See Amazon EC2 Instance IP
Addressing
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses).)

=back

When connecting to a game session that is running on a TLS-enabled
fleet, you must use the DNS name, not the IP address.


=head2 EndTime => Str

Time stamp indicating when this request was completed, canceled, or
timed out.


=head2 GameProperties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::GameProperty>]

A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session.
For example: C<{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}>.


=head2 GameSessionArn => Str

Identifier for the game session created by this placement request. This
identifier is unique across all Regions. This value isn't final until
placement status is C<FULFILLED>.


=head2 GameSessionData => Str

A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string
value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to
start a new game session. For more information, see Start a game
session
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession).


=head2 GameSessionId => Str

A unique identifier for the game session. This value isn't final until
placement status is C<FULFILLED>.


=head2 GameSessionName => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with a game session. Session
names do not need to be unique.


=head2 GameSessionQueueName => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue
names must be unique within each Region.


=head2 GameSessionRegion => Str

Name of the Region where the game session created by this placement
request is running. This value isn't final until placement status is
C<FULFILLED>.


=head2 IpAddress => Str

The IP address of the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift
game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number. This
value isn't final until placement status is C<FULFILLED>.


=head2 MatchmakerData => Str

Information on the matchmaking process for this game. Data is in JSON
syntax, formatted as a string. It identifies the matchmaking
configuration used to create the match, and contains data on all
players assigned to the match, including player attributes and team
assignments. For more details on matchmaker data, see Match Data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-server.html#match-server-data).


=head2 MaximumPlayerSessionCount => Int

The maximum number of players that can be connected simultaneously to
the game session.


=head2 PlacedPlayerSessions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::PlacedPlayerSession>]

A collection of information on player sessions created in response to
the game session placement request. These player sessions are created
only after a new game session is successfully placed (placement status
is C<FULFILLED>). This information includes the player ID, provided in
the placement request, and a corresponding player session ID.


=head2 PlacementId => Str

A unique identifier for a game session placement.


=head2 PlayerLatencies => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::PlayerLatency>]

A set of values, expressed in milliseconds, that indicates the amount
of latency that a player experiences when connected to Amazon Web
Services Regions.


=head2 Port => Int

The port number for the game session. To connect to a Amazon GameLift
game server, an app needs both the IP address and port number. This
value isn't final until placement status is C<FULFILLED>.


=head2 PriorityConfigurationOverride => L<Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfigurationOverride>

An alternative priority list of locations that's included with a game
session placement request. When provided, the list overrides a queue's
location order list for this game session placement request only. The
list might include Amazon Web Services Regions, local zones, and custom
locations (for Anywhere fleets). The fallback strategy tells Amazon
GameLift what action to take (if any) in the event that it failed to
place a new game session.


=head2 StartTime => Str

Time stamp indicating when this request was placed in the queue. Format
is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 Status => Str

Current status of the game session placement request.

=over

=item *

B<PENDING> -- The placement request is in the queue waiting to be
processed. Game session properties are not yet final.

=item *

B<FULFILLED> -- A new game session has been successfully placed. Game
session properties are now final.

=item *

B<CANCELLED> -- The placement request was canceled.

=item *

B<TIMED_OUT> -- A new game session was not successfully created before
the time limit expired. You can resubmit the placement request as
needed.

=item *

B<FAILED> -- Amazon GameLift is not able to complete the process of
placing the game session. Common reasons are the game session
terminated before the placement process was completed, or an unexpected
internal error.
