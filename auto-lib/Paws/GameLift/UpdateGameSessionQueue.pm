=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::UpdateGameSessionQueue - Arguments for method UpdateGameSessionQueue on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method UpdateGameSessionQueue on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method UpdateGameSessionQueue.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to UpdateGameSessionQueue.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $UpdateGameSessionQueueOutput = $gamelift->UpdateGameSessionQueue(
      Name            => 'MyGameSessionQueueNameOrArn',
      CustomEventData => 'MyQueueCustomEventData',        # OPTIONAL
      Destinations    => [
        {
          DestinationArn => 'MyArnStringModel',    # min: 1, max: 512; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      FilterConfiguration => {
        AllowedLocations => [
          'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
        ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      NotificationTarget    => 'MyQueueSnsArnStringModel',    # OPTIONAL
      PlayerLatencyPolicies => [
        {
          MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds => 1,    # OPTIONAL
          PolicyDurationSeconds                      => 1,    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      PriorityConfiguration => {
        LocationOrder => [
          'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
        ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
        PriorityOrder => [
          'LATENCY', ...    # values: LATENCY, COST, DESTINATION, LOCATION
        ],    # min: 1, max: 4; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      TimeoutInSeconds => 1,    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameSessionQueue = $UpdateGameSessionQueueOutput->GameSessionQueue;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::UpdateGameSessionQueueOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomEventData => Str

Information to be added to all events that are related to this game
session queue.



=head2 Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::GameSessionQueueDestination>]

A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game
session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by
either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of
placement preference. When updating this list, provide a complete list
of destinations.



=head2 FilterConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::FilterConfiguration>

A list of locations where a queue is allowed to place new game
sessions. Locations are specified in the form of Amazon Web Services
Region codes, such as C<us-west-2>. If this parameter is not set, game
sessions can be placed in any queue location. To remove an existing
filter configuration, pass in an empty set.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue
names must be unique within each Region. You can use either the queue
ID or ARN value.



=head2 NotificationTarget => Str

An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive game session placement
notifications. See Setting up notifications for game session placement
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/queue-notification.html).



=head2 PlayerLatencyPolicies => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::PlayerLatencyPolicy>]

A set of policies that enforce a sliding cap on player latency when
processing game sessions placement requests. Use multiple policies to
gradually relax the cap over time if Amazon GameLift can't make a
placement. Policies are evaluated in order starting with the lowest
maximum latency value. When updating policies, provide a complete
collection of policies.



=head2 PriorityConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfiguration>

Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and locations for
game session placements. This configuration replaces the FleetIQ
default prioritization process. Priority types that are not explicitly
named will be automatically applied at the end of the prioritization
process. To remove an existing priority configuration, pass in an empty
set.



=head2 TimeoutInSeconds => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request
remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game
session placement changes to a C<TIMED_OUT> status.
