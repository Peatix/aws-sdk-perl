=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::Alias

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::Alias object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AliasArn => $value, ..., RoutingStrategy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::Alias object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AliasArn

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AliasArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift alias resource and uniquely
identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
C<arn:aws:gamelift:E<lt>regionE<gt>::alias/alias-a1234567-b8c9-0d1e-2fa3-b45c6d7e8912>.
In a GameLift alias ARN, the resource ID matches the alias ID value.


=head2 AliasId => Str

A unique identifier for the alias. Alias IDs are unique within a
Region.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

A time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a
number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 Description => Str

A human-readable description of an alias.


=head2 LastUpdatedTime => Str

The time that this data object was last modified. Format is a number
expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example
C<"1469498468.057">).


=head2 Name => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with an alias. Alias names do
not need to be unique.


=head2 RoutingStrategy => L<Paws::GameLift::RoutingStrategy>

The routing configuration, including routing type and fleet target, for
the alias.
