=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::CreateGameSessionQueue - Arguments for method CreateGameSessionQueue on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method CreateGameSessionQueue on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method CreateGameSessionQueue.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to CreateGameSessionQueue.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $CreateGameSessionQueueOutput = $gamelift->CreateGameSessionQueue(
      Name            => 'MyGameSessionQueueName',
      CustomEventData => 'MyQueueCustomEventData',    # OPTIONAL
      Destinations    => [
        {
          DestinationArn => 'MyArnStringModel',    # min: 1, max: 512; OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      FilterConfiguration => {
        AllowedLocations => [
          'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
        ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      NotificationTarget    => 'MyQueueSnsArnStringModel',    # OPTIONAL
      PlayerLatencyPolicies => [
        {
          MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds => 1,    # OPTIONAL
          PolicyDurationSeconds                      => 1,    # OPTIONAL
        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      PriorityConfiguration => {
        LocationOrder => [
          'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
        ],    # min: 1, max: 100; OPTIONAL
        PriorityOrder => [
          'LATENCY', ...    # values: LATENCY, COST, DESTINATION, LOCATION
        ],    # min: 1, max: 4; OPTIONAL
      },    # OPTIONAL
      Tags => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      TimeoutInSeconds => 1,    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameSessionQueue = $CreateGameSessionQueueOutput->GameSessionQueue;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::CreateGameSessionQueueOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CustomEventData => Str

Information to be added to all events that are related to this game
session queue.



=head2 Destinations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::GameSessionQueueDestination>]

A list of fleets and/or fleet aliases that can be used to fulfill game
session placement requests in the queue. Destinations are identified by
either a fleet ARN or a fleet alias ARN, and are listed in order of
placement preference.



=head2 FilterConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::FilterConfiguration>

A list of locations where a queue is allowed to place new game
sessions. Locations are specified in the form of Amazon Web Services
Region codes, such as C<us-west-2>. If this parameter is not set, game
sessions can be placed in any queue location.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A descriptive label that is associated with game session queue. Queue
names must be unique within each Region.



=head2 NotificationTarget => Str

An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive game session placement
notifications. See Setting up notifications for game session placement
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/queue-notification.html).



=head2 PlayerLatencyPolicies => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::PlayerLatencyPolicy>]

A set of policies that enforce a sliding cap on player latency when
processing game sessions placement requests. Use multiple policies to
gradually relax the cap over time if Amazon GameLift can't make a
placement. Policies are evaluated in order starting with the lowest
maximum latency value.



=head2 PriorityConfiguration => L<Paws::GameLift::PriorityConfiguration>

Custom settings to use when prioritizing destinations and locations for
game session placements. This configuration replaces the FleetIQ
default prioritization process. Priority types that are not explicitly
named will be automatically applied at the end of the prioritization
process.



=head2 Tags => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::Tag>]

A list of labels to assign to the new game session queue resource. Tags
are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services
resources are useful for resource management, access management and
cost allocation. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services
Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html) in the
I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.



=head2 TimeoutInSeconds => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that a new game session placement request
remains in the queue. When a request exceeds this time, the game
session placement changes to a C<TIMED_OUT> status. If you don't
specify a request timeout, the queue uses a default value.
