This class represents the parameters used for calling the method RegisterGameServer on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $RegisterGameServerOutput = $gamelift->RegisterGameServer(
      GameServerGroupName => 'MyGameServerGroupNameOrArn',
      GameServerId        => 'MyGameServerId',
      InstanceId          => 'MyGameServerInstanceId',
      ConnectionInfo      => 'MyGameServerConnectionInfo',    # OPTIONAL
      GameServerData      => 'MyGameServerData',              # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $GameServer = $RegisterGameServerOutput->GameServer;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::RegisterGameServerOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
