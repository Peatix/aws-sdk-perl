=head1 NAME

Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerGroupCounts

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerGroupCounts object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ACTIVE => $value, ..., TERMINATING => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::GameLift::GameServerContainerGroupCounts object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ACTIVE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The number and status of game server container groups that are deployed
across a container fleet. Combine this count with the number of server
processes that each game server container group runs to learn how many
game sessions the fleet is capable of hosting concurrently. For
example, if a fleet has 50 game server container groups, and the game
server container in each group runs 1 game server process, then the
fleet has the capacity to run host 50 game sessions at a time.
