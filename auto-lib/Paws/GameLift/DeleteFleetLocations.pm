Paws::GameLift::DeleteFleetLocations - Arguments for method DeleteFleetLocations on L<Paws::GameLift>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method DeleteFleetLocations on the
L<Amazon GameLift|Paws::GameLift> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method DeleteFleetLocations.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to DeleteFleetLocations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $gamelift = Paws->service('GameLift');
    my $DeleteFleetLocationsOutput = $gamelift->DeleteFleetLocations(
      FleetId   => 'MyFleetIdOrArn',
      Locations => [
        'MyLocationStringModel', ...    # min: 1, max: 64
      ],

    );

    # Results:
    my $FleetArn       = $DeleteFleetLocationsOutput->FleetArn;
    my $FleetId        = $DeleteFleetLocationsOutput->FleetId;
    my $LocationStates = $DeleteFleetLocationsOutput->LocationStates;

    # Returns a L<Paws::GameLift::DeleteFleetLocationsOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
