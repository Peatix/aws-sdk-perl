=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AcceptanceRequired => Bool

A flag that indicates whether a match that was created with this
configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require
acceptance, set to TRUE. With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets
use the status C<REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE> to indicate when a completed
potential match is waiting for player acceptance.



=head2 AcceptanceTimeoutSeconds => Int

The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a
proposed match, if acceptance is required.



=head2 AdditionalPlayerCount => Int

The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players.
For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a
single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2,
only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used
if C<FlexMatchMode> is set to C<STANDALONE>.



=head2 BackfillMode => Str

The method that is used to backfill game sessions created with this
matchmaking configuration. Specify MANUAL when your game manages
backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature.
Specify AUTOMATIC to have GameLift create a match backfill request
whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about
manual and automatic backfill in Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html).
Automatic backfill is not available when C<FlexMatchMode> is set to
C<STANDALONE>.

Valid values are: C<"AUTOMATIC">, C<"MANUAL">

=head2 CustomEventData => Str

Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking
configuration.



=head2 Description => Str

A description for the matchmaking configuration.



=head2 FlexMatchMode => Str

Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with
Amazon GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution.

B<STANDALONE> - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information,
including players and team assignments, in a MatchmakingSucceeded
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded)
event.

=item *

B<WITH_QUEUE> - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified Amazon
GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.

=back


Valid values are: C<"STANDALONE">, C<"WITH_QUEUE">

=head2 GameProperties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::GameLift::GameProperty>]

A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session.
For example: C<{"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}>. This
information is added to the new C<GameSession> object that is created
for a successful match. This parameter is not used if C<FlexMatchMode>
is set to C<STANDALONE>.



=head2 GameSessionData => Str

A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string
value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to
start a new game session. For more information, see Start a game
session
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession).
This information is added to the game session that is created for a
successful match. This parameter is not used if C<FlexMatchMode> is set
to C<STANDALONE>.



=head2 GameSessionQueueArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html))
that is assigned to a Amazon GameLift game session queue resource and
uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is
C<arn:aws:gamelift:E<lt>regionE<gt>::gamesessionqueue/E<lt>queue
nameE<gt>>. Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to
start new Amazon GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that are
created with this matchmaking configuration. If C<FlexMatchMode> is set
to C<STANDALONE>, do not set this parameter.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration to update. You
can use either the configuration name or ARN value.



=head2 NotificationTarget => Str

An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications.
See Setting up notifications for matchmaking
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-notification.html)
for more information.



=head2 RequestTimeoutSeconds => Int

The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain
in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can
be resubmitted as needed.



=head2 RuleSetName => Str

A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this
configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A
matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in
the same Region.
