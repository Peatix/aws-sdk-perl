=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::EcsEnvironmentFile

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::EcsEnvironmentFile object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::EcsEnvironmentFile object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of files containing the environment variables to pass to a
container. You can specify up to ten environment files. The file must
have a C<.env> file extension. Each line in an environment file should
contain an environment variable in C<VARIABLE=VALUE> format. Lines
beginning with C<#> are treated as comments and are ignored. For more
information about the environment variable file syntax, see Declare
default environment variables in file
(https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/).

If there are environment variables specified using the C<environment>
parameter in a container definition, they take precedence over the
variables contained within an environment file. If multiple environment
files are specified that contain the same variable, they're processed
from the top down. We recommend that you use unique variable names. For
more information, see Specifying environment variables
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/taskdef-envfiles.html)
in the I<Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide>.

This parameter is only supported for tasks hosted on Fargate using the
following platform versions:

=over

=item *

Linux platform version C<1.4.0> or later.

=item *

Windows platform version C<1.0.0> or later.
