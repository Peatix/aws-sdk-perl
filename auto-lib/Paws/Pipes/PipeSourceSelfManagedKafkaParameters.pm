=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeSourceSelfManagedKafkaParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeSourceSelfManagedKafkaParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalBootstrapServers => $value, ..., Vpc => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeSourceSelfManagedKafkaParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalBootstrapServers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters for using a self-managed Apache Kafka stream as a
source.

A I<self managed> cluster refers to any Apache Kafka cluster not hosted
by Amazon Web Services. This includes both clusters you manage
yourself, as well as those hosted by a third-party provider, such as
Confluent Cloud (https://www.confluent.io/), CloudKarafka
(https://www.cloudkarafka.com/), or Redpanda (https://redpanda.com/).
For more information, see Apache Kafka streams as a source
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-pipes-kafka.html)
in the I<Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.

The ARN of the Secrets Manager secret used for certification.


=head2 StartingPosition => Str

The position in a stream from which to start reading.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TopicName => Str
