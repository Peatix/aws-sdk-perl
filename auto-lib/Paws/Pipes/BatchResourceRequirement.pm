=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::BatchResourceRequirement

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::BatchResourceRequirement object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Type => $value, ..., Value => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::BatchResourceRequirement object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The type and amount of a resource to assign to a container. The
supported resources include C<GPU>, C<MEMORY>, and C<VCPU>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of resource to assign to a container. The supported resources
include C<GPU>, C<MEMORY>, and C<VCPU>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Value => Str

The quantity of the specified resource to reserve for the container.
The values vary based on the C<type> specified.

=over

=item type="GPU"

The number of physical GPUs to reserve for the container. Make sure
that the number of GPUs reserved for all containers in a job doesn't
exceed the number of available GPUs on the compute resource that the
job is launched on.

GPUs aren't available for jobs that are running on Fargate resources.

=item type="MEMORY"

The memory hard limit (in MiB) present to the container. This parameter
is supported for jobs that are running on EC2 resources. If your
container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is
terminated. This parameter maps to C<Memory> in the Create a container
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container) section
of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/)
and the C<--memory> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). You must specify at
least 4 MiB of memory for a job. This is required but can be specified
in several places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be
specified for each node at least once. This parameter maps to C<Memory>
in the Create a container
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container) section
of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/)
and the C<--memory> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing
your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type,
see Memory management
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html)
in the I<Batch User Guide>.

For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then C<value> is the
hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of the supported values and the
C<VCPU> values must be one of the values supported for that memory
value.

=item type="VCPU"

The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to
C<CpuShares> in the Create a container
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/#create-a-container) section
of the Docker Remote API (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.23/)
and the C<--cpu-shares> option to docker run
(https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). Each vCPU is
equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at
least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several
places; it must be specified for each node at least once.

The default for the Fargate On-Demand vCPU resource count quota is 6
vCPUs. For more information about Fargate quotas, see Fargate quotas
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecs-service.html#service-quotas-fargate)
in the I<Amazon Web Services General Reference>.

For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then C<value> must
match one of the supported values and the C<MEMORY> values must be one
of the values supported for that C<VCPU> value. The supported values
are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16
