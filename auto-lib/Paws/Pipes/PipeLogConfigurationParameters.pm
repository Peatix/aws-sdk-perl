=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeLogConfigurationParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeLogConfigurationParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CloudwatchLogsLogDestination => $value, ..., S3LogDestination => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeLogConfigurationParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CloudwatchLogsLogDestination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the logging configuration settings for the pipe.

When you call C<UpdatePipe>, EventBridge updates the fields in the
C<PipeLogConfigurationParameters> object atomically as one and
overrides existing values. This is by design. If you don't specify an
optional field in any of the Amazon Web Services service parameters
objects (C<CloudwatchLogsLogDestinationParameters>,
C<FirehoseLogDestinationParameters>, or C<S3LogDestinationParameters>),
EventBridge sets that field to its system-default value during the
update.

For example, suppose when you created the pipe you specified a Firehose
stream log destination. You then update the pipe to add an Amazon S3
log destination. In addition to specifying the
C<S3LogDestinationParameters> for the new log destination, you must
also specify the fields in the C<FirehoseLogDestinationParameters>
object in order to retain the Firehose stream log destination.

For more information on generating pipe log records, see Log
EventBridge Pipes in the I<Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CloudwatchLogsLogDestination => L<Paws::Pipes::CloudwatchLogsLogDestinationParameters>

The Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging configuration settings for the pipe.


=head2 FirehoseLogDestination => L<Paws::Pipes::FirehoseLogDestinationParameters>

The Amazon Data Firehose logging configuration settings for the pipe.


=head2 IncludeExecutionData => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Specify C<ALL> to include the execution data (specifically, the
C<payload>, C<awsRequest>, and C<awsResponse> fields) in the log
messages for this pipe.

This applies to all log destinations for the pipe.

For more information, see Including execution data in logs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-pipes-logs.html#eb-pipes-logs-execution-data)
in the I<Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.

By default, execution data is not included.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Level => Str

The level of logging detail to include. This applies to all log
destinations for the pipe.

For more information, see Specifying EventBridge Pipes log level
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-pipes-logs.html#eb-pipes-logs-level)
in the I<Amazon EventBridge User Guide>.


=head2 S3LogDestination => L<Paws::Pipes::S3LogDestinationParameters>

The Amazon S3 logging configuration settings for the pipe.
