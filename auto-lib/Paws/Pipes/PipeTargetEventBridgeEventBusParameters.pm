=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetEventBridgeEventBusParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetEventBridgeEventBusParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DetailType => $value, ..., Time => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetEventBridgeEventBusParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DetailType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DetailType => Str

A free-form string, with a maximum of 128 characters, used to decide
what fields to expect in the event detail.


=head2 EndpointId => Str

The URL subdomain of the endpoint. For example, if the URL for Endpoint
is https://abcde.veo.endpoints.event.amazonaws.com, then the EndpointId
is C<abcde.veo>.


=head2 Resources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Amazon Web Services resources, identified by Amazon Resource Name
(ARN), which the event primarily concerns. Any number, including zero,
may be present.


=head2 Source => Str

The source of the event.


=head2 Time => Str

The time stamp of the event, per RFC3339
