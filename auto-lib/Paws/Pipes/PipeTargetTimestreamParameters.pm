=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetTimestreamParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetTimestreamParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DimensionMappings => $value, ..., VersionValue => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetTimestreamParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DimensionMappings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters for using a Timestream for LiveAnalytics table as a
target.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DimensionMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Pipes::DimensionMapping>]

Map source data to dimensions in the target Timestream for
LiveAnalytics table.

For more information, see Amazon Timestream for LiveAnalytics concepts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/concepts.html)


=head2 EpochTimeUnit => Str

The granularity of the time units used. Default is C<MILLISECONDS>.

Required if C<TimeFieldType> is specified as C<EPOCH>.


=head2 MultiMeasureMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Pipes::MultiMeasureMapping>]

Maps multiple measures from the source event to the same record in the
specified Timestream for LiveAnalytics table.


=head2 SingleMeasureMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Pipes::SingleMeasureMapping>]

Mappings of single source data fields to individual records in the
specified Timestream for LiveAnalytics table.


=head2 TimeFieldType => Str

The type of time value used.

The default is C<EPOCH>.


=head2 TimestampFormat => Str

How to format the timestamps. For example, C<yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'>.

Required if C<TimeFieldType> is specified as C<TIMESTAMP_FORMAT>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeValue => Str

Dynamic path to the source data field that represents the time value
for your data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VersionValue => Str

64 bit version value or source data field that represents the version
value for your data.

Write requests with a higher version number will update the existing
measure values of the record and version. In cases where the measure
value is the same, the version will still be updated.

Default value is 1.

Timestream for LiveAnalytics does not support updating partial measure
values in a record.

Write requests for duplicate data with a higher version number will
update the existing measure value and version. In cases where the
measure value is the same, C<Version> will still be updated. Default
value is C<1>.

C<Version> must be C<1> or greater, or you will receive a
C<ValidationException> error.
