=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::S3LogDestinationParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::S3LogDestinationParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BucketName => $value, ..., Prefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::S3LogDestinationParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BucketName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Amazon S3 logging configuration settings for the pipe.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BucketName => Str

Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which EventBridge
delivers the log records for the pipe.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> BucketOwner => Str

Specifies the Amazon Web Services account that owns the Amazon S3
bucket to which EventBridge delivers the log records for the pipe.


=head2 OutputFormat => Str

How EventBridge should format the log records.

EventBridge currently only supports C<json> formatting.


=head2 Prefix => Str

Specifies any prefix text with which to begin Amazon S3 log object
names.

You can use prefixes to organize the data that you store in Amazon S3
buckets. A prefix is a string of characters at the beginning of the
object key name. A prefix can be any length, subject to the maximum
length of the object key name (1,024 bytes). For more information, see
Organizing objects using prefixes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-prefixes.html)
in the I<Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide>.
