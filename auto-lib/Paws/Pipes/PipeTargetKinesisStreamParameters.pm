=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetKinesisStreamParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetKinesisStreamParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { PartitionKey => $value, ..., PartitionKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeTargetKinesisStreamParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->PartitionKey

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters for using a Kinesis stream as a target.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PartitionKey => Str

Determines which shard in the stream the data record is assigned to.
Partition keys are Unicode strings with a maximum length limit of 256
characters for each key. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams uses the partition
key as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and
associated data to a specific shard. Specifically, an MD5 hash function
is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map
associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing
mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same
shard within the stream.
