=head1 NAME

Paws::Pipes::PipeEnrichmentParameters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Pipes::PipeEnrichmentParameters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HttpParameters => $value, ..., InputTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Pipes::PipeEnrichmentParameters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HttpParameters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parameters required to set up enrichment on your pipe.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HttpParameters => L<Paws::Pipes::PipeEnrichmentHttpParameters>

Contains the HTTP parameters to use when the target is a API Gateway
REST endpoint or EventBridge ApiDestination.

If you specify an API Gateway REST API or EventBridge ApiDestination as
a target, you can use this parameter to specify headers, path
parameters, and query string keys/values as part of your target
invoking request. If you're using ApiDestinations, the corresponding
Connection can also have these values configured. In case of any
conflicting keys, values from the Connection take precedence.


=head2 InputTemplate => Str

Valid JSON text passed to the enrichment. In this case, nothing from
the event itself is passed to the enrichment. For more information, see
The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange Format
(http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt).

To remove an input template, specify an empty string.
