=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceIdentifier

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceIdentifier object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceIdentifier object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Identifying information for a traffic source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Identifier => Str

Identifies the traffic source.

For Application Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, Network Load
Balancers, and VPC Lattice, this will be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
for a target group in this account and Region. For Classic Load
Balancers, this will be the name of the Classic Load Balancer in this
account and Region.

For example:

=over

=item *

Application Load Balancer ARN:
C<arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/my-targets/1234567890123456>

=item *

Classic Load Balancer name: C<my-classic-load-balancer>

=item *

VPC Lattice ARN:
C<arn:aws:vpc-lattice:us-west-2:123456789012:targetgroup/tg-1234567890123456>

=back

To get the ARN of a target group for a Application Load Balancer,
Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer, or the name of a
Classic Load Balancer, use the Elastic Load Balancing
DescribeTargetGroups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTargetGroups.html)
and DescribeLoadBalancers
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLoadBalancers.html)
API operations.

To get the ARN of a target group for VPC Lattice, use the VPC Lattice
GetTargetGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/APIReference/API_GetTargetGroup.html)
API operation.


=head2 Type => Str

Provides additional context for the value of C<Identifier>.

The following lists the valid values:

=over

=item *

C<elb> if C<Identifier> is the name of a Classic Load Balancer.

=item *

C<elbv2> if C<Identifier> is the ARN of an Application Load Balancer,
Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer target group.

=item *

C<vpc-lattice> if C<Identifier> is the ARN of a VPC Lattice target
group.

=back

Required if the identifier is the name of a Classic Load Balancer.
