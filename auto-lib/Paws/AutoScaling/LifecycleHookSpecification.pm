=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHookSpecification

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHookSpecification object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DefaultResult => $value, ..., RoleARN => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHookSpecification object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DefaultResult

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes information used to specify a lifecycle hook for an Auto
Scaling group.

For more information, see Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DefaultResult => Str

The action the Auto Scaling group takes when the lifecycle hook timeout
elapses or if an unexpected failure occurs. The default value is
C<ABANDON>.

Valid values: C<CONTINUE> | C<ABANDON>


=head2 HeartbeatTimeout => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that can elapse before the lifecycle hook
times out. The range is from C<30> to C<7200> seconds. The default
value is C<3600> seconds (1 hour).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LifecycleHookName => Str

The name of the lifecycle hook.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LifecycleTransition => Str

The lifecycle transition. For Auto Scaling groups, there are two major
lifecycle transitions.

=over

=item *

To create a lifecycle hook for scale-out events, specify
C<autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING>.

=item *

To create a lifecycle hook for scale-in events, specify
C<autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING>.

=back



=head2 NotificationMetadata => Str

Additional information that you want to include any time Amazon EC2
Auto Scaling sends a message to the notification target.


=head2 NotificationTargetARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the notification target that Amazon
EC2 Auto Scaling sends notifications to when an instance is in a wait
state for the lifecycle hook. You can specify an Amazon SNS topic or an
Amazon SQS queue.


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that allows the Auto Scaling group to publish
to the specified notification target. For information about creating
this role, see Prepare to add a lifecycle hook to your Auto Scaling
group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/prepare-for-lifecycle-notifications.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

Valid only if the notification target is an Amazon SNS topic or an
Amazon SQS queue.
