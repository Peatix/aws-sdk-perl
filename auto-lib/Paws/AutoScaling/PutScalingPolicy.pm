=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::PutScalingPolicy - Arguments for method PutScalingPolicy on L<Paws::AutoScaling>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutScalingPolicy on the
L<Auto Scaling|Paws::AutoScaling> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutScalingPolicy.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutScalingPolicy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $autoscaling = Paws->service('AutoScaling');
   # To add a scaling policy to an Auto Scaling group
   # This example adds the specified policy to the specified Auto Scaling group.
    my $PolicyARNType = $autoscaling->PutScalingPolicy(
      'AutoScalingGroupName'        => 'my-auto-scaling-group',
      'PolicyName'                  => 'alb1000-target-tracking-scaling-policy',
      'PolicyType'                  => 'TargetTrackingScaling',
      'TargetTrackingConfiguration' => {
        'PredefinedMetricSpecification' => {
          'PredefinedMetricType' => 'ALBRequestCountPerTarget',
          'ResourceLabel'        =>
'app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/targetgroup/my-alb-target-group/943f017f100becff'
        },
        'TargetValue' => 1000
      }
    );

    # Results:
    my $Alarms    = $PolicyARNType->Alarms;
    my $PolicyARN = $PolicyARNType->PolicyARN;

    # Returns a L<Paws::AutoScaling::PolicyARNType> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/autoscaling/PutScalingPolicy>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdjustmentType => Str

Specifies how the scaling adjustment is interpreted (for example, an
absolute number or a percentage). The valid values are
C<ChangeInCapacity>, C<ExactCapacity>, and C<PercentChangeInCapacity>.

Required if the policy type is C<StepScaling> or C<SimpleScaling>. For
more information, see Scaling adjustment types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> AutoScalingGroupName => Str

The name of the Auto Scaling group.



=head2 Cooldown => Int

A cooldown period, in seconds, that applies to a specific simple
scaling policy. When a cooldown period is specified here, it overrides
the default cooldown.

Valid only if the policy type is C<SimpleScaling>. For more
information, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

Default: None



=head2 Enabled => Bool

Indicates whether the scaling policy is enabled or disabled. The
default is enabled. For more information, see Disable a scaling policy
for an Auto Scaling group
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-enable-disable-scaling-policy.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.



=head2 EstimatedInstanceWarmup => Int

I<Not needed if the default instance warmup is defined for the group.>

The estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance can
contribute to the CloudWatch metrics. This warm-up period applies to
instances launched due to a specific target tracking or step scaling
policy. When a warm-up period is specified here, it overrides the
default instance warmup.

Valid only if the policy type is C<TargetTrackingScaling> or
C<StepScaling>.

The default is to use the value for the default instance warmup defined
for the group. If default instance warmup is null, then
C<EstimatedInstanceWarmup> falls back to the value of default cooldown.



=head2 MetricAggregationType => Str

The aggregation type for the CloudWatch metrics. The valid values are
C<Minimum>, C<Maximum>, and C<Average>. If the aggregation type is
null, the value is treated as C<Average>.

Valid only if the policy type is C<StepScaling>.



=head2 MinAdjustmentMagnitude => Int

The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type is
C<PercentChangeInCapacity>. For example, suppose that you create a step
scaling policy to scale out an Auto Scaling group by 25 percent and you
specify a C<MinAdjustmentMagnitude> of 2. If the group has 4 instances
and the scaling policy is performed, 25 percent of 4 is 1. However,
because you specified a C<MinAdjustmentMagnitude> of 2, Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling scales out the group by 2 instances.

Valid only if the policy type is C<StepScaling> or C<SimpleScaling>.
For more information, see Scaling adjustment types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-simple-step.html#as-scaling-adjustment)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

Some Auto Scaling groups use instance weights. In this case, set the
C<MinAdjustmentMagnitude> to a value that is at least as large as your
largest instance weight.



=head2 MinAdjustmentStep => Int

Available for backward compatibility. Use C<MinAdjustmentMagnitude>
instead.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PolicyName => Str

The name of the policy.



=head2 PolicyType => Str

One of the following policy types:

=over

=item *

C<TargetTrackingScaling>

=item *

C<StepScaling>

=item *

C<SimpleScaling> (default)

=item *

C<PredictiveScaling>

=back




=head2 PredictiveScalingConfiguration => L<Paws::AutoScaling::PredictiveScalingConfiguration>

A predictive scaling policy. Provides support for predefined and custom
metrics.

Predefined metrics include CPU utilization, network in/out, and the
Application Load Balancer request count.

For more information, see PredictiveScalingConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_PredictiveScalingConfiguration.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference>.

Required if the policy type is C<PredictiveScaling>.



=head2 ScalingAdjustment => Int

The amount by which to scale, based on the specified adjustment type. A
positive value adds to the current capacity while a negative number
removes from the current capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify
a non-negative value.

Required if the policy type is C<SimpleScaling>. (Not used with any
other policy type.)



=head2 StepAdjustments => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AutoScaling::StepAdjustment>]

A set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size of the
alarm breach.

Required if the policy type is C<StepScaling>. (Not used with any other
policy type.)



=head2 TargetTrackingConfiguration => L<Paws::AutoScaling::TargetTrackingConfiguration>

A target tracking scaling policy. Provides support for predefined or
custom metrics.

The following predefined metrics are available:

=over

=item *

C<ASGAverageCPUUtilization>

=item *

C<ASGAverageNetworkIn>

=item *

C<ASGAverageNetworkOut>

=item *

C<ALBRequestCountPerTarget>

=back

If you specify C<ALBRequestCountPerTarget> for the metric, you must
specify the C<ResourceLabel> property with the
C<PredefinedMetricSpecification>.

For more information, see TargetTrackingConfiguration
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_TargetTrackingConfiguration.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API Reference>.

Required if the policy type is C<TargetTrackingScaling>.
