=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::MixedInstancesPolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::MixedInstancesPolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InstancesDistribution => $value, ..., LaunchTemplate => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::MixedInstancesPolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InstancesDistribution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this structure to launch multiple instance types and On-Demand
Instances and Spot Instances within a single Auto Scaling group.

A mixed instances policy contains information that Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling can use to launch instances and help optimize your costs. For
more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types
and purchase options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InstancesDistribution => L<Paws::AutoScaling::InstancesDistribution>

The instances distribution.


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::AutoScaling::LaunchTemplate>

One or more launch templates and the instance types (overrides) that
are used to launch EC2 instances to fulfill On-Demand and Spot
capacities.
