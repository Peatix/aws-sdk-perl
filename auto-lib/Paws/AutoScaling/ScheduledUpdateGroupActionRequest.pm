=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupActionRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupActionRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DesiredCapacity => $value, ..., TimeZone => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupActionRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DesiredCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes information used for one or more scheduled scaling action
updates in a BatchPutScheduledUpdateGroupAction
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_BatchPutScheduledUpdateGroupAction.html)
operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DesiredCapacity => Int

The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group
after the scheduled action runs and the capacity it attempts to
maintain.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The date and time for the recurring schedule to end, in UTC.


=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 MinSize => Int

The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 Recurrence => Str

The recurring schedule for the action, in Unix cron syntax format. This
format consists of five fields separated by white spaces: [Minute]
[Hour] [Day_of_Month] [Month_of_Year] [Day_of_Week]. The value must be
in quotes (for example, C<"30 0 1 1,6,12 *">). For more information
about this format, see Crontab (http://crontab.org).

When C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> are specified with C<Recurrence>, they
form the boundaries of when the recurring action starts and stops.

Cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) by default.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScheduledActionName => Str

The name of the scaling action.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The date and time for the action to start, in YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
format in UTC/GMT only and in quotes (for example,
C<"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z">).

If you specify C<Recurrence> and C<StartTime>, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
performs the action at this time, and then performs the action based on
the specified recurrence.

If you try to schedule the action in the past, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
returns an error message.


=head2 TimeZone => Str

Specifies the time zone for a cron expression. If a time zone is not
provided, UTC is used by default.

Valid values are the canonical names of the IANA time zones, derived
from the IANA Time Zone Database (such as C<Etc/GMT+9> or
C<Pacific/Tahiti>). For more information, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
