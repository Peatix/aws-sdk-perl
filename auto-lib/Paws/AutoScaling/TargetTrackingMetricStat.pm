=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::TargetTrackingMetricStat

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::TargetTrackingMetricStat object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Metric => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::TargetTrackingMetricStat object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Metric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This structure defines the CloudWatch metric to return, along with the
statistic and unit.

For more information about the CloudWatch terminology below, see Amazon
CloudWatch concepts
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudWatch User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Metric => L<Paws::AutoScaling::Metric>

The metric to use.


=head2 Period => Int

The period of the metric in seconds. The default value is 60. Accepted
values are 10, 30, and 60. For high resolution metric, set the value to
less than 60. For more information, see Create a target tracking policy
using high-resolution metrics for faster response
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/policy-creating-high-resolution-metrics.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Stat => Str

The statistic to return. It can include any CloudWatch statistic or
extended statistic. For a list of valid values, see the table in
Statistics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Statistic)
in the I<Amazon CloudWatch User Guide>.

The most commonly used metric for scaling is C<Average>.


=head2 Unit => Str

The unit to use for the returned data points. For a complete list of
the units that CloudWatch supports, see the MetricDatum
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_MetricDatum.html)
data type in the I<Amazon CloudWatch API Reference>.
