=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceMaintenancePolicy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceMaintenancePolicy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaxHealthyPercentage => $value, ..., MinHealthyPercentage => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceMaintenancePolicy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaxHealthyPercentage

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an instance maintenance policy.

in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxHealthyPercentage => Int

Specifies the upper threshold as a percentage of the desired capacity
of the Auto Scaling group. It represents the maximum percentage of the
group that can be in service and healthy, or pending, to support your
workload when replacing instances. Value range is 100 to 200. To clear
a previously set value, specify a value of C<-1>.

Both C<MinHealthyPercentage> and C<MaxHealthyPercentage> must be
specified, and the difference between them cannot be greater than 100.
A large range increases the number of instances that can be replaced at
the same time.


=head2 MinHealthyPercentage => Int

Specifies the lower threshold as a percentage of the desired capacity
of the Auto Scaling group. It represents the minimum percentage of the
group to keep in service, healthy, and ready to use to support your
workload when replacing instances. Value range is 0 to 100. To clear a
previously set value, specify a value of C<-1>.
