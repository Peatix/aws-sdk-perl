=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupAction

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupAction object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingGroupName => $value, ..., TimeZone => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::ScheduledUpdateGroupAction object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingGroupName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a scheduled scaling action.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingGroupName => Str

The name of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 DesiredCapacity => Int

The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group
after the scheduled action runs and the capacity it attempts to
maintain.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The date and time in UTC for the recurring schedule to end. For
example, C<"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z">.


=head2 MaxSize => Int

The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 MinSize => Int

The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 Recurrence => Str

The recurring schedule for the action, in Unix cron syntax format.

When C<StartTime> and C<EndTime> are specified with C<Recurrence>, they
form the boundaries of when the recurring action starts and stops.


=head2 ScheduledActionARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the scheduled action.


=head2 ScheduledActionName => Str

The name of the scheduled action.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The date and time in UTC for this action to start. For example,
