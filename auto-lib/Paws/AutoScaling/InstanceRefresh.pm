=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceRefresh

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceRefresh object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingGroupName => $value, ..., StatusReason => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceRefresh object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingGroupName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an instance refresh for an Auto Scaling group.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingGroupName => Str

The name of the Auto Scaling group.


=head2 DesiredConfiguration => L<Paws::AutoScaling::DesiredConfiguration>

Describes the desired configuration for the instance refresh.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The date and time at which the instance refresh ended.


=head2 InstanceRefreshId => Str

The instance refresh ID.


=head2 InstancesToUpdate => Int

The number of instances remaining to update before the instance refresh
is complete.

If you roll back the instance refresh, C<InstancesToUpdate> shows you
the number of instances that were not yet updated by the instance
refresh. Therefore, these instances don't need to be replaced as part
of the rollback.


=head2 PercentageComplete => Int

The percentage of the instance refresh that is complete. For each
instance replacement, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling tracks the instance's
health status and warm-up time. When the instance's health status
changes to healthy and the specified warm-up time passes, the instance
is considered updated and is added to the percentage complete.

C<PercentageComplete> does not include instances that are replaced
during a rollback. This value gradually goes back down to zero during a
rollback.


=head2 Preferences => L<Paws::AutoScaling::RefreshPreferences>

The preferences for an instance refresh.


=head2 ProgressDetails => L<Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceRefreshProgressDetails>

Additional progress details for an Auto Scaling group that has a warm
pool.


=head2 RollbackDetails => L<Paws::AutoScaling::RollbackDetails>

The rollback details.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The date and time at which the instance refresh began.


=head2 Status => Str

The current status for the instance refresh operation:

=over

=item *

C<Pending> - The request was created, but the instance refresh has not
started.

=item *

C<InProgress> - An instance refresh is in progress.

=item *

C<Successful> - An instance refresh completed successfully.

=item *

C<Failed> - An instance refresh failed to complete. You can
troubleshoot using the status reason and the scaling activities.

=item *

C<Cancelling> - An ongoing instance refresh is being cancelled.

=item *

C<Cancelled> - The instance refresh is cancelled.

=item *

C<RollbackInProgress> - An instance refresh is being rolled back.

=item *

C<RollbackFailed> - The rollback failed to complete. You can
troubleshoot using the status reason and the scaling activities.

=item *

C<RollbackSuccessful> - The rollback completed successfully.

=item *

C<Baking> - Waiting the specified bake time after an instance refresh
has finished updating instances.

=back



=head2 StatusReason => Str

The explanation for the specific status assigned to this operation.
