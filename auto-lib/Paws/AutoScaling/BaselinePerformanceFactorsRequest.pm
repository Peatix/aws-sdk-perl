=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::BaselinePerformanceFactorsRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::BaselinePerformanceFactorsRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Cpu => $value, ..., Cpu => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::BaselinePerformanceFactorsRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Cpu

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The baseline performance to consider, using an instance family as a
baseline reference. The instance family establishes the lowest
acceptable level of performance. Auto Scaling uses this baseline to
guide instance type selection, but there is no guarantee that the
selected instance types will always exceed the baseline for every
application.

Currently, this parameter only supports CPU performance as a baseline
performance factor. For example, specifying C<c6i> uses the CPU
performance of the C<c6i> family as the baseline reference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Cpu => L<Paws::AutoScaling::CpuPerformanceFactorRequest>

The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the
baseline reference.
