=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::Filter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::Filter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::Filter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a filter that is used to return a more specific list of
results from a describe operation.

If you specify multiple filters, the filters are automatically
logically joined with an C<AND>, and the request returns only the
results that match all of the specified filters.

For more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-tagging.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the filter.

The valid values for C<Name> depend on which API operation you're using
with the filter (DescribeAutoScalingGroups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeAutoScalingGroups.html)
or DescribeTags
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/APIReference/API_DescribeTags.html)).

B<DescribeAutoScalingGroups>

Valid values for C<Name> include the following:

=over

=item *

C<tag-key> - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information
about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag keys.

=item *

C<tag-value> - Accepts tag values. The results only include information
about the Auto Scaling groups associated with these tag values.

=item *

C<tag:E<lt>keyE<gt>> - Accepts the key/value combination of the tag.
Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter
value. The results only include information about the Auto Scaling
groups associated with the specified key/value combination.

=back

B<DescribeTags>

Valid values for C<Name> include the following:

=over

=item *

C<auto-scaling-group> - Accepts the names of Auto Scaling groups. The
results only include information about the tags associated with these
Auto Scaling groups.

=item *

C<key> - Accepts tag keys. The results only include information about
the tags associated with these tag keys.

=item *

C<value> - Accepts tag values. The results only include information
about the tags associated with these tag values.

=item *

C<propagate-at-launch> - Accepts a Boolean value, which specifies
whether tags propagate to instances at launch. The results only include
information about the tags associated with the specified Boolean value.

=back



=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

If you specify multiple values for a filter, the values are
automatically logically joined with an C<OR>, and the request returns
all results that match any of the specified values. For example,
specify "tag:environment" for the filter name and
"production,development" for the filter values to find Auto Scaling
groups with the tag "environment=production" or
"environment=development".
