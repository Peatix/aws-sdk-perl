=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Identifier => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::TrafficSourceState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Identifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the state of a traffic source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Identifier => Str

The unique identifier of the traffic source.


=head2 State => Str

Describes the current state of a traffic source.

The state values are as follows:

=over

=item *

C<Adding> - The Auto Scaling instances are being registered with the
load balancer or target group.

=item *

C<Added> - All Auto Scaling instances are registered with the load
balancer or target group.

=item *

C<InService> - For an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer or target
group, at least one Auto Scaling instance passed an C<ELB> health
check. For VPC Lattice, at least one Auto Scaling instance passed an
C<VPC_LATTICE> health check.

=item *

C<Removing> - The Auto Scaling instances are being deregistered from
the load balancer or target group. If connection draining
(deregistration delay) is enabled, Elastic Load Balancing or VPC
Lattice waits for in-flight requests to complete before deregistering
the instances.

=item *

C<Removed> - All Auto Scaling instances are deregistered from the load
balancer or target group.

=back



=head2 TrafficSource => Str

This is replaced by C<Identifier>.


=head2 Type => Str

Provides additional context for the value of C<Identifier>.

The following lists the valid values:

=over

=item *

C<elb> if C<Identifier> is the name of a Classic Load Balancer.

=item *

C<elbv2> if C<Identifier> is the ARN of an Application Load Balancer,
Gateway Load Balancer, or Network Load Balancer target group.

=item *

C<vpc-lattice> if C<Identifier> is the ARN of a VPC Lattice target
group.

=back

Required if the identifier is the name of a Classic Load Balancer.
