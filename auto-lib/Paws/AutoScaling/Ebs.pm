=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::Ebs

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::Ebs object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeleteOnTermination => $value, ..., VolumeType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::Ebs object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeleteOnTermination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes information used to set up an Amazon EBS volume specified in
a block device mapping.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DeleteOnTermination => Bool

Indicates whether the volume is deleted on instance termination. For
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, the default value is C<true>.


=head2 Encrypted => Bool

Specifies whether the volume should be encrypted. Encrypted EBS volumes
can only be attached to instances that support Amazon EBS encryption.
For more information, see Requirements for Amazon EBS encryption
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.html)
in the I<Amazon EBS User Guide>. If your AMI uses encrypted volumes,
you can also only launch it on supported instance types.

If you are creating a volume from a snapshot, you cannot create an
unencrypted volume from an encrypted snapshot. Also, you cannot specify
a KMS key ID when using a launch configuration.

If you enable encryption by default, the EBS volumes that you create
are always encrypted, either using the Amazon Web Services managed KMS
key or a customer-managed KMS key, regardless of whether the snapshot
was encrypted.

For more information, see Use Amazon Web Services KMS keys to encrypt
Amazon EBS volumes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-data-protection.html#encryption)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 Iops => Int

The number of input/output (I/O) operations per second (IOPS) to
provision for the volume. For C<gp3> and C<io1> volumes, this
represents the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For
C<gp2> volumes, this represents the baseline performance of the volume
and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting.

The following are the supported values for each volume type:

=over

=item *

C<gp3>: 3,000-16,000 IOPS

=item *

C<io1>: 100-64,000 IOPS

=back

For C<io1> volumes, we guarantee 64,000 IOPS only for Instances built
on the Amazon Web Services Nitro System
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/instancetypes/ec2-nitro-instances.html).
Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS.

C<Iops> is supported when the volume type is C<gp3> or C<io1> and
required only when the volume type is C<io1>. (Not used with
C<standard>, C<gp2>, C<st1>, or C<sc1> volumes.)


=head2 SnapshotId => Str

The snapshot ID of the volume to use.

You must specify either a C<VolumeSize> or a C<SnapshotId>.


=head2 Throughput => Int

The throughput (MiBps) to provision for a C<gp3> volume.


=head2 VolumeSize => Int

The volume size, in GiBs. The following are the supported volumes sizes
for each volume type:

=over

=item *

C<gp2> and C<gp3>: 1-16,384

=item *

C<io1>: 4-16,384

=item *

C<st1> and C<sc1>: 125-16,384

=item *

C<standard>: 1-1,024

=back

You must specify either a C<SnapshotId> or a C<VolumeSize>. If you
specify both C<SnapshotId> and C<VolumeSize>, the volume size must be
equal or greater than the size of the snapshot.


=head2 VolumeType => Str

The volume type. For more information, see Amazon EBS volume types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-volume-types.html)
in the I<Amazon EBS User Guide>.

Valid values: C<standard> | C<io1> | C<gp2> | C<st1> | C<sc1> | C<gp3>
