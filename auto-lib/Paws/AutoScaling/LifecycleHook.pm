=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoScalingGroupName => $value, ..., RoleARN => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AutoScalingGroupName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a lifecycle hook. A lifecycle hook lets you create solutions
that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and
then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding
lifecycle event occurs.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoScalingGroupName => Str

The name of the Auto Scaling group for the lifecycle hook.


=head2 DefaultResult => Str

The action the Auto Scaling group takes when the lifecycle hook timeout
elapses or if an unexpected failure occurs.

Valid values: C<CONTINUE> | C<ABANDON>


=head2 GlobalTimeout => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that an instance can remain in a wait
state. The maximum is 172800 seconds (48 hours) or 100 times
C<HeartbeatTimeout>, whichever is smaller.


=head2 HeartbeatTimeout => Int

The maximum time, in seconds, that can elapse before the lifecycle hook
times out. If the lifecycle hook times out, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
performs the action that you specified in the C<DefaultResult>
property.


=head2 LifecycleHookName => Str

The name of the lifecycle hook.


=head2 LifecycleTransition => Str

The lifecycle transition.

Valid values: C<autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING> |
C<autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_TERMINATING>


=head2 NotificationMetadata => Str

Additional information that is included any time Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling sends a message to the notification target.


=head2 NotificationTargetARN => Str

The ARN of the target that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling sends notifications
to when an instance is in a wait state for the lifecycle hook.


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The ARN of the IAM role that allows the Auto Scaling group to publish
to the specified notification target (an Amazon SNS topic or an Amazon
SQS queue).
