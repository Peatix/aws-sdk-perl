=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociatePublicIpAddress => $value, ..., UserData => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::LaunchConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociatePublicIpAddress

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a launch configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociatePublicIpAddress => Bool

Specifies whether to assign a public IPv4 address to the group's
instances. If the instance is launched into a default subnet, the
default is to assign a public IPv4 address, unless you disabled the
option to assign a public IPv4 address on the subnet. If the instance
is launched into a nondefault subnet, the default is not to assign a
public IPv4 address, unless you enabled the option to assign a public
IPv4 address on the subnet. For more information, see Provide network
connectivity for your Auto Scaling instances using Amazon VPC
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/asg-in-vpc.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 BlockDeviceMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AutoScaling::BlockDeviceMapping>]

The block device mapping entries that define the block devices to
attach to the instances at launch. By default, the block devices
specified in the block device mapping for the AMI are used. For more
information, see Block device mappings
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.


=head2 ClassicLinkVPCId => Str

Available for backward compatibility.


=head2 ClassicLinkVPCSecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Available for backward compatibility.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedTime => Str

The creation date and time for the launch configuration.


=head2 EbsOptimized => Bool

Specifies whether the launch configuration is optimized for EBS I/O
(C<true>) or not (C<false>). For more information, see Amazon
EBS-optimized instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.


=head2 IamInstanceProfile => Str

The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the instance profile
associated with the IAM role for the instance. The instance profile
contains the IAM role. For more information, see IAM role for
applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/us-iam-role.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImageId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use to launch your EC2
instances. For more information, see Find a Linux AMI
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-ami.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.


=head2 InstanceMonitoring => L<Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceMonitoring>

Controls whether instances in this group are launched with detailed
(C<true>) or basic (C<false>) monitoring.

For more information, see Configure monitoring for Auto Scaling
instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/latest/userguide/enable-as-instance-metrics.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InstanceType => Str

The instance type for the instances. For information about available
instance types, see Available instance types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#AvailableInstanceTypes)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.


=head2 KernelId => Str

The ID of the kernel associated with the AMI.


=head2 KeyName => Str

The name of the key pair.

For more information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Amazon EC2 instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.


=head2 LaunchConfigurationARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the launch configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> LaunchConfigurationName => Str

The name of the launch configuration.


=head2 MetadataOptions => L<Paws::AutoScaling::InstanceMetadataOptions>

The metadata options for the instances. For more information, see
Configure the instance metadata options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-config.html#launch-configurations-imds)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 PlacementTenancy => Str

The tenancy of the instance, either C<default> or C<dedicated>. An
instance with C<dedicated> tenancy runs on isolated, single-tenant
hardware and can only be launched into a VPC.


=head2 RamdiskId => Str

The ID of the RAM disk associated with the AMI.


=head2 SecurityGroups => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list that contains the security groups to assign to the instances in
the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Control traffic to
your Amazon Web Services resources using security groups
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html)
in the I<Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide>.


=head2 SpotPrice => Str

The maximum hourly price to be paid for any Spot Instance launched to
fulfill the request. Spot Instances are launched when the price you
specify exceeds the current Spot price. For more information, see
Requesting Spot Instances for fault-tolerant and flexible applications
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-template-spot-instances.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 UserData => Str

The user data to make available to the launched EC2 instances. For more
information, see Instance metadata and user data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
(Linux) and Instance metadata and user data
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html)
(Windows). If you are using a command line tool, base64-encoding is
performed for you, and you can load the text from a file. Otherwise,
you must provide base64-encoded text. User data is limited to 16 KB.
