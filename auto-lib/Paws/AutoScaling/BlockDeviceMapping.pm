=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::BlockDeviceMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::BlockDeviceMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DeviceName => $value, ..., VirtualName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::BlockDeviceMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DeviceName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a block device mapping.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DeviceName => Str

The device name assigned to the volume (for example, C</dev/sdh> or
C<xvdh>). For more information, see Device naming on Linux instances
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/device_naming.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances>.

To define a block device mapping, set the device name and exactly one
of the following properties: C<Ebs>, C<NoDevice>, or C<VirtualName>.


=head2 Ebs => L<Paws::AutoScaling::Ebs>

Information to attach an EBS volume to an instance at launch.


=head2 NoDevice => Bool

Setting this value to C<true> prevents a volume that is included in the
block device mapping of the AMI from being mapped to the specified
device name at launch.

If C<NoDevice> is C<true> for the root device, instances might fail the
EC2 health check. In that case, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches
replacement instances.


=head2 VirtualName => Str

The name of the instance store volume (virtual device) to attach to an
instance at launch. The name must be in the form ephemeralI<X> where
I<X> is a number starting from zero (0), for example, C<ephemeral0>.
