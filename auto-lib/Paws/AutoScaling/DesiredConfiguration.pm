=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::DesiredConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::DesiredConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { LaunchTemplate => $value, ..., MixedInstancesPolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::DesiredConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->LaunchTemplate

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the desired configuration for an instance refresh.

If you specify a desired configuration, you must specify either a
C<LaunchTemplate> or a C<MixedInstancesPolicy>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 LaunchTemplate => L<Paws::AutoScaling::LaunchTemplateSpecification>

Describes the launch template and the version of the launch template
that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses to launch Amazon EC2 instances. For
more information about launch templates, see Launch templates
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/launch-templates.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.


=head2 MixedInstancesPolicy => L<Paws::AutoScaling::MixedInstancesPolicy>

Use this structure to launch multiple instance types and On-Demand
Instances and Spot Instances within a single Auto Scaling group.

A mixed instances policy contains information that Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling can use to launch instances and help optimize your costs. For
more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types
and purchase options
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-mixed-instances-groups.html)
in the I<Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide>.
