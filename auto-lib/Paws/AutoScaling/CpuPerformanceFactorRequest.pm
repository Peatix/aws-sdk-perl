=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::CpuPerformanceFactorRequest

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::CpuPerformanceFactorRequest object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { References => $value, ..., References => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::CpuPerformanceFactorRequest object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->References

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The CPU performance to consider, using an instance family as the
baseline reference.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 References => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AutoScaling::PerformanceFactorReferenceRequest>]

Specify an instance family to use as the baseline reference for CPU
performance. All instance types that match your specified attributes
will be compared against the CPU performance of the referenced instance
family, regardless of CPU manufacturer or architecture differences.

Currently only one instance family can be specified in the list.
