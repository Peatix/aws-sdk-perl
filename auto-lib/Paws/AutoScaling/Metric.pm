=head1 NAME

Paws::AutoScaling::Metric

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::AutoScaling::Metric object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dimensions => $value, ..., Namespace => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::AutoScaling::Metric object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dimensions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a specific metric.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dimensions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::AutoScaling::MetricDimension>]

The dimensions for the metric. For the list of available dimensions,
see the Amazon Web Services documentation available from the table in
Amazon Web Services services that publish CloudWatch metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
in the I<Amazon CloudWatch User Guide>.

Conditional: If you published your metric with dimensions, you must
specify the same dimensions in your scaling policy.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricName => Str

The name of the metric.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Namespace => Str

The namespace of the metric. For more information, see the table in
Amazon Web Services services that publish CloudWatch metrics
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html)
