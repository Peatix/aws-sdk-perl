=head1 NAME

Paws::RUM::MetricDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RUM::MetricDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DimensionKeys => $value, ..., ValueKey => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RUM::MetricDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DimensionKeys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that displays the definition of one extended metric that
RUM sends to CloudWatch or CloudWatch Evidently. For more information,
see Additional metrics that you can send to CloudWatch and CloudWatch
Evidently
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-vended-metrics.html).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DimensionKeys => L<Paws::RUM::DimensionKeysMap>

This field is a map of field paths to dimension names. It defines the
dimensions to associate with this metric in CloudWatch The value of
this field is used only if the metric destination is C<CloudWatch>. If
the metric destination is C<Evidently>, the value of C<DimensionKeys>
is ignored.


=head2 EventPattern => Str

The pattern that defines the metric. RUM checks events that happen in a
user's session against the pattern, and events that match the pattern
are sent to the metric destination.

If the metrics destination is C<CloudWatch> and the event also matches
a value in C<DimensionKeys>, then the metric is published with the
specified dimensions.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MetricDefinitionId => Str

The ID of this metric definition.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the metric that is defined in this structure.


=head2 Namespace => Str

If this metric definition is for a custom metric instead of an extended
metric, this field displays the metric namespace that the custom metric
is published to.


=head2 UnitLabel => Str

Use this field only if you are sending this metric to CloudWatch. It
defines the CloudWatch metric unit that this metric is measured in.


=head2 ValueKey => Str

The field within the event object that the metric value is sourced
from.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::RUM>
