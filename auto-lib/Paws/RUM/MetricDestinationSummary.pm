=head1 NAME

Paws::RUM::MetricDestinationSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RUM::MetricDestinationSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., IamRoleArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RUM::MetricDestinationSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that displays information about one destination that
CloudWatch RUM sends extended metrics to.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => Str

=head2 DestinationArn => Str

If the destination is C<Evidently>, this specifies the ARN of the
Evidently experiment that receives the metrics.

This field appears only when the destination is C<Evidently>. It
specifies the ARN of the IAM role that is used to write to the
Evidently experiment that receives the metrics.
