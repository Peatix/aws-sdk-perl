=head1 NAME

Paws::RUM::QueryFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::RUM::QueryFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Name => $value, ..., Values => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::RUM::QueryFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that defines a key and values that you can use to filter
the results. The only performance events that are returned are those
that have values matching the ones that you specify in one of your
C<QueryFilter> structures.

For example, you could specify C<Browser> as the C<Name> and specify
C<Chrome,Firefox> as the C<Values> to return events generated only from
those browsers.

Specifying C<Invert> as the C<Name> works as a "not equal to" filter.
For example, specify C<Invert> as the C<Name> and specify C<Chrome> as
the value to return all events except events from user sessions with
the Chrome browser.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Name => Str

The name of a key to search for. The filter returns only the events
that match the C<Name> and C<Values> that you specify.

Valid values for C<Name> are C<Browser> | C<Device> | C<Country> |
C<Page> | C<OS> | C<EventType> | C<Invert>


=head2 Values => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The values of the C<Name> that are to be be included in the returned
results.
