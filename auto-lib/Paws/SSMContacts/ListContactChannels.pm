    # To list the contact channels of a contact
    # The following list-contact-channels example lists the available contact
    # channels of the specified contact.
    my $ListContactChannelsResult =
      $ssm -
      contacts->ListContactChannels( 'ContactId' =>
        'arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/akuam' );
