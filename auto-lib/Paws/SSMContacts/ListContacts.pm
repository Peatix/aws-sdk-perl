Paws::SSMContacts::ListContacts - Arguments for method ListContacts on L<Paws::SSMContacts>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method ListContacts on the
L<AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager Contacts|Paws::SSMContacts> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method ListContacts.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to ListContacts.

# To list all escalation plans and contacts
# The following list-contacts example lists the contacts and escalation plans in
# your account.
    my $ListContactsResult = $ssm -contacts->ListContacts();

    # Results:

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
