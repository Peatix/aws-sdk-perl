=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { GlobalConfidenceLevel => $value, ..., InlineRedactionPatterns => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->GlobalConfidenceLevel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The configuration for in-session inline redaction.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 GlobalConfidenceLevel => Int

The global confidence level for the inline redaction configuration.
This indicates the certainty of data type matches in the redaction
process. Confidence level 3 means high confidence, and requires a
formatted text pattern match in order for content to be redacted.
Confidence level 2 means medium confidence, and redaction considers
both formatted and unformatted text, and adds keyword associate to the
logic. Confidence level 1 means low confidence, and redaction is
enforced for both formatted pattern + unformatted pattern without
keyword. This is applied to patterns that do not have a pattern-level
confidence level. Defaults to confidence level 2.


=head2 GlobalEnforcedUrls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The global enforced URL configuration for the inline redaction
configuration. This is applied to patterns that do not have a
pattern-level enforced URL list.


=head2 GlobalExemptUrls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The global exempt URL configuration for the inline redaction
configuration. This is applied to patterns that do not have a
pattern-level exempt URL list.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InlineRedactionPatterns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionPattern>]

The inline redaction patterns to be enabled for the inline redaction
configuration.
