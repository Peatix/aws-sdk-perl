=head1 NAME

Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionPattern

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionPattern object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BuiltInPatternId => $value, ..., RedactionPlaceHolder => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::InlineRedactionPattern object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BuiltInPatternId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The set of patterns that determine the data types redacted in session.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BuiltInPatternId => Str

The built-in pattern from the list of preconfigured patterns. Either a
customPattern or builtInPatternId is required.


=head2 ConfidenceLevel => Int

The confidence level for inline redaction pattern. This indicates the
certainty of data type matches in the redaction process. Confidence
level 3 means high confidence, and requires a formatted text pattern
match in order for content to be redacted. Confidence level 2 means
medium confidence, and redaction considers both formatted and
unformatted text, and adds keyword associate to the logic. Confidence
level 1 means low confidence, and redaction is enforced for both
formatted pattern + unformatted pattern without keyword. This overrides
the global confidence level.


=head2 CustomPattern => L<Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::CustomPattern>

E<gt>The configuration for a custom pattern. Either a customPattern or
builtInPatternId is required.


=head2 EnforcedUrls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The enforced URL configuration for the inline redaction pattern. This
will override the global enforced URL configuration.


=head2 ExemptUrls => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The exempt URL configuration for the inline redaction pattern. This
will override the global exempt URL configuration for the inline
redaction pattern.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RedactionPlaceHolder => L<Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::RedactionPlaceHolder>

The redaction placeholder that will replace the redacted text in
session for the inline redaction pattern.
