Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::NetworkSettings

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::NetworkSettings object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociatedPortalArns => $value, ..., VpcId => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::WorkSpacesWeb::NetworkSettings object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociatedPortalArns

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A network settings resource that can be associated with a web portal.
Once associated with a web portal, network settings define how
streaming instances will connect with your specified VPC.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AssociatedPortalArns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of web portal ARNs that this network settings is associated
with.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> NetworkSettingsArn => Str

The ARN of the network settings.


=head2 SecurityGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

One or more security groups used to control access from streaming
instances to your VPC.


=head2 SubnetIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The subnets in which network interfaces are created to connect
streaming instances to your VPC. At least two of these subnets must be
in different availability zones.


=head2 VpcId => Str

The VPC that streaming instances will connect to.
