=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingWorkflowInputSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingWorkflowInputSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InputSourceARN => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingWorkflowInputSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InputSourceARN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object containing C<InputSourceARN>, C<SchemaName>, and C<Type>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InputSourceARN => Str

An Glue table Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or a matching workflow ARN for
the input source table.


=head2 SchemaName => Str

The name of the schema to be retrieved.


=head2 Type => Str

The type of ID namespace. There are two types: C<SOURCE> and C<TARGET>.

The C<SOURCE> contains configurations for C<sourceId> data that will be
processed in an ID mapping workflow.

The C<TARGET> contains a configuration of C<targetId> which all
C<sourceIds> will resolve to.
