=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingRuleBasedProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingRuleBasedProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeMatchingModel => $value, ..., Rules => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingRuleBasedProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeMatchingModel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that defines the list of matching rules to run in an ID
mapping workflow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeMatchingModel => Str

The comparison type. You can either choose C<ONE_TO_ONE> or
C<MANY_TO_MANY> as the C<attributeMatchingModel>.

If you choose C<MANY_TO_MANY>, the system can match attributes across
the sub-types of an attribute type. For example, if the value of the
C<Email> field of Profile A matches the value of the C<BusinessEmail>
field of Profile B, the two profiles are matched on the C<Email>
attribute type.

If you choose C<ONE_TO_ONE>, the system can only match attributes if
the sub-types are an exact match. For example, for the C<Email>
attribute type, the system will only consider it a match if the value
of the C<Email> field of Profile A matches the value of the C<Email>
field of Profile B.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RecordMatchingModel => Str

The type of matching record that is allowed to be used in an ID mapping
workflow.

If the value is set to C<ONE_SOURCE_TO_ONE_TARGET>, only one record in
the source can be matched to the same record in the target.

If the value is set to C<MANY_SOURCE_TO_ONE_TARGET>, multiple records
in the source can be matched to one record in the target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RuleDefinitionType => Str

The set of rules you can use in an ID mapping workflow. The limitations
specified for the source or target to define the match rules must be
compatible.


=head2 Rules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EntityResolution::Rule>]

The rules that can be used for ID mapping.
