=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::InputSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::InputSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ApplyNormalization => $value, ..., SchemaName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::InputSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ApplyNormalization

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object containing C<InputSourceARN>, C<SchemaName>, and
C<ApplyNormalization>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ApplyNormalization => Bool

Normalizes the attributes defined in the schema in the input data. For
example, if an attribute has an C<AttributeType> of C<PHONE_NUMBER>,
and the data in the input table is in a format of 1234567890, Entity
Resolution will normalize this field in the output to (123)-456-7890.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InputSourceARN => Str

An Glue table Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the input source table.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SchemaName => Str

The name of the schema to be retrieved.
