=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::IdNamespaceSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::IdNamespaceSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CreatedAt => $value, ..., UpdatedAt => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::IdNamespaceSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CreatedAt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A summary of ID namespaces.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> CreatedAt => Str

The timestamp of when the ID namespace was created.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the ID namespace.


=head2 IdMappingWorkflowProperties => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EntityResolution::IdNamespaceIdMappingWorkflowMetadata>]

An object which defines any additional configurations required by the
ID mapping workflow.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IdNamespaceArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ID namespace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IdNamespaceName => Str

The name of the ID namespace.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The type of ID namespace. There are two types: C<SOURCE> and C<TARGET>.

The C<SOURCE> contains configurations for C<sourceId> data that will be
processed in an ID mapping workflow.

The C<TARGET> contains a configuration of C<targetId> which all
C<sourceIds> will resolve to.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> UpdatedAt => Str

The timestamp of when the ID namespace was last updated.
