=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::RuleBasedProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::RuleBasedProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributeMatchingModel => $value, ..., Rules => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::RuleBasedProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributeMatchingModel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object which defines the list of matching rules to run in a matching
workflow. RuleBasedProperties contain a C<Rules> field, which is a list
of rule objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AttributeMatchingModel => Str

The comparison type. You can either choose C<ONE_TO_ONE> or
C<MANY_TO_MANY> as the C<attributeMatchingModel>.

If you choose C<MANY_TO_MANY>, the system can match attributes across
the sub-types of an attribute type. For example, if the value of the
C<Email> field of Profile A and the value of C<BusinessEmail> field of
Profile B matches, the two profiles are matched on the C<Email>
attribute type.

If you choose C<ONE_TO_ONE>, the system can only match attributes if
the sub-types are an exact match. For example, for the C<Email>
attribute type, the system will only consider it a match if the value
of the C<Email> field of Profile A matches the value of the C<Email>
field of Profile B.


=head2 MatchPurpose => Str

An indicator of whether to generate IDs and index the data or not.

If you choose C<IDENTIFIER_GENERATION>, the process generates IDs and
indexes the data.

If you choose C<INDEXING>, the process indexes the data without
generating IDs.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Rules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::EntityResolution::Rule>]

A list of C<Rule> objects, each of which have fields C<RuleName> and
C<MatchingKeys>.
