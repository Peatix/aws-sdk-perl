=head1 NAME

Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingJobMetrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingJobMetrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { InputRecords => $value, ..., UniqueRecordsLoaded => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::EntityResolution::IdMappingJobMetrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->InputRecords

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that contains metrics about an ID mapping job, including
counts of input records, processed records, and mapped records between
source and target identifiers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 InputRecords => Int

The total number of records that were input for processing.


=head2 RecordsNotProcessed => Int

The total number of records that did not get processed.


=head2 TotalMappedRecords => Int

The total number of records that were mapped.


=head2 TotalMappedSourceRecords => Int

The total number of mapped source records.


=head2 TotalMappedTargetRecords => Int

The total number of distinct mapped target records.


=head2 TotalRecordsProcessed => Int

The total number of records that were processed.


=head2 UniqueRecordsLoaded => Int

The number of records remaining after loading and aggregating duplicate
records. Duplicates are determined by the field marked as UNIQUE_ID in
your schema mapping - records sharing the same value in this field are
considered duplicates. For example, if you specified "customer_id" as a
UNIQUE_ID field and had three records with the same customer_id value,
they would count as one unique record in this metric.
