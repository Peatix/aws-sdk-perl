=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTAnalytics::DeltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::DeltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { TimeoutInMinutes => $value, ..., TimeoutInMinutes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::DeltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->TimeoutInMinutes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the configuration information of a delta time
session window.

C<DeltaTime>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DeltaTime.html)
specifies a time interval. You can use C<DeltaTime> to create dataset
contents with data that has arrived in the data store since the last
execution. For an example of C<DeltaTime>, see Creating a SQL dataset
with a delta window (CLI)
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/automate-create-dataset.html#automate-example6)
in the I<IoT Analytics User Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> TimeoutInMinutes => Int

A time interval. You can use C<timeoutInMinutes> so that IoT Analytics
can batch up late data notifications that have been generated since the
last execution. IoT Analytics sends one batch of notifications to
Amazon CloudWatch Events at one time.

For more information about how to write a timestamp expression, see
Date and Time Functions and Operators
(https://prestodb.io/docs/0.172/functions/datetime.html), in the
I<Presto 0.172 Documentation>.
