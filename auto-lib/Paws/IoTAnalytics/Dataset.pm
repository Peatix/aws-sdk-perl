=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTAnalytics::Dataset

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::Dataset object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actions => $value, ..., VersioningConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::Dataset object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a dataset.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatasetAction>]

The C<DatasetAction> objects that automatically create the dataset
contents.


=head2 Arn => Str

The ARN of the dataset.


=head2 ContentDeliveryRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatasetContentDeliveryRule>]

When dataset contents are created they are delivered to destinations
specified here.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

When the dataset was created.


=head2 LastUpdateTime => Str

The last time the dataset was updated.


=head2 LateDataRules => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::LateDataRule>]

A list of data rules that send notifications to CloudWatch, when data
arrives late. To specify C<lateDataRules>, the dataset must use a
DeltaTimer
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/APIReference/API_DeltaTime.html)
filter.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the dataset.


=head2 RetentionPeriod => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::RetentionPeriod>

Optional. How long, in days, message data is kept for the dataset.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the dataset.


=head2 Triggers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatasetTrigger>]

The C<DatasetTrigger> objects that specify when the dataset is
automatically updated.


=head2 VersioningConfiguration => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::VersioningConfiguration>

Optional. How many versions of dataset contents are kept. If not
specified or set to null, only the latest version plus the latest
succeeded version (if they are different) are kept for the time period
specified by the C<retentionPeriod> parameter. For more information,
see Keeping Multiple Versions of IoT Analytics datasets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iotanalytics/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#aws-iot-analytics-dataset-versions)
in the I<IoT Analytics User Guide>.
