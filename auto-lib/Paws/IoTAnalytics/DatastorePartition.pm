=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatastorePartition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatastorePartition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AttributePartition => $value, ..., TimestampPartition => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTAnalytics::DatastorePartition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AttributePartition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single dimension to partition a data store. The dimension must be an
C<AttributePartition> or a C<TimestampPartition>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AttributePartition => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::Partition>

A partition dimension defined by an C<attributeName>.


=head2 TimestampPartition => L<Paws::IoTAnalytics::TimestampPartition>

A partition dimension defined by a timestamp attribute.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::IoTAnalytics>
