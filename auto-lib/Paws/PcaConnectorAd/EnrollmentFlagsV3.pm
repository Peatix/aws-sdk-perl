=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::EnrollmentFlagsV3

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::EnrollmentFlagsV3 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EnableKeyReuseOnNtTokenKeysetStorageFull => $value, ..., UserInteractionRequired => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::EnrollmentFlagsV3 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EnableKeyReuseOnNtTokenKeysetStorageFull

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Template configurations for v3 template schema.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EnableKeyReuseOnNtTokenKeysetStorageFull => Bool

Allow renewal using the same key.


=head2 IncludeSymmetricAlgorithms => Bool

Include symmetric algorithms allowed by the subject.


=head2 NoSecurityExtension => Bool

This flag instructs the CA to not include the security extension
szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT (OID:1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2), as specified in
[MS-WCCE] sections 2.2.2.7.7.4 and 3.2.2.6.2.1.4.5.9, in the issued
certificate. This addresses a Windows Kerberos elevation-of-privilege
vulnerability.


=head2 RemoveInvalidCertificateFromPersonalStore => Bool

Delete expired or revoked certificates instead of archiving them.


=head2 UserInteractionRequired => Bool

Require user interaction when the subject is enrolled and the private
key associated with the certificate is used.
