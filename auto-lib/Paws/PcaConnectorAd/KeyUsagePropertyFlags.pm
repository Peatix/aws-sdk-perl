=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsagePropertyFlags

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsagePropertyFlags object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Decrypt => $value, ..., Sign => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsagePropertyFlags object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Decrypt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies key usage.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Decrypt => Bool

Allows key for encryption and decryption.


=head2 KeyAgreement => Bool

Allows key exchange without encryption.


=head2 Sign => Bool

Allow key use for digital signature.
