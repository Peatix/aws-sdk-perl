=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV4

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV4 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientVersion => $value, ..., UseLegacyProvider => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV4 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Private key flags for v4 templates specify the client compatibility, if
the private key can be exported, if user input is required when using a
private key, if an alternate signature algorithm should be used, and if
certificates are renewed using the same private key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientVersion => Str

Defines the minimum client compatibility.


=head2 ExportableKey => Bool

Allows the private key to be exported.


=head2 RequireAlternateSignatureAlgorithm => Bool

Requires the PKCS #1 v2.1 signature format for certificates. You should
verify that your CA, objects, and applications can accept this
signature format.


=head2 RequireSameKeyRenewal => Bool

Renew certificate using the same private key.


=head2 StrongKeyProtectionRequired => Bool

Require user input when using the private key for enrollment.


=head2 UseLegacyProvider => Bool

Specifies the cryptographic service provider category used to generate
private keys. Set to TRUE to use Legacy Cryptographic Service Providers
and FALSE to use Key Storage Providers.
