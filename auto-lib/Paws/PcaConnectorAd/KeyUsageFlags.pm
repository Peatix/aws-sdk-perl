=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsageFlags

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsageFlags object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataEncipherment => $value, ..., NonRepudiation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsageFlags object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataEncipherment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The key usage flags represent the purpose (e.g., encipherment,
signature) of the key contained in the certificate.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataEncipherment => Bool

DataEncipherment is asserted when the subject public key is used for
directly enciphering raw user data without the use of an intermediate
symmetric cipher.


=head2 DigitalSignature => Bool

The digitalSignature is asserted when the subject public key is used
for verifying digital signatures.


=head2 KeyAgreement => Bool

KeyAgreement is asserted when the subject public key is used for key
agreement.


=head2 KeyEncipherment => Bool

KeyEncipherment is asserted when the subject public key is used for
enciphering private or secret keys, i.e., for key transport.


=head2 NonRepudiation => Bool

NonRepudiation is asserted when the subject public key is used to
verify digital signatures.
