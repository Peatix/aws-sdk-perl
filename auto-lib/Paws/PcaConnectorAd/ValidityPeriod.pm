  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Period => $value, ..., PeriodType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::ValidityPeriod object:

  $result->Att1->Period

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information describing the end of the validity period of the
certificate. This parameter sets the E<ldquo>Not AfterE<rdquo> date for
the certificate. Certificate validity is the period of time during
which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit
date and time when the certificate expires, or as a span of time after
issuance, stated in hours, days, months, or years. For more
information, see Validity in RFC 5280. This value is unaffected when
ValidityNotBefore is also specified. For example, if Validity is set to
20 days in the future, the certificate will expire 20 days from
issuance time regardless of the ValidityNotBefore value.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Period => Int

The numeric value for the validity period.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PeriodType => Str

The unit of time. You can select hours, days, weeks, months, and years.
