=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyAttributesV4

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyAttributesV4 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Algorithm => $value, ..., MinimalKeyLength => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyAttributesV4 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the attributes of the private key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Algorithm => Str

Defines the algorithm used to generate the private key.


=head2 CryptoProviders => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Defines the cryptographic providers used to generate the private key.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> KeySpec => Str

Defines the purpose of the private key. Set it to "KEY_EXCHANGE" or
"SIGNATURE" value.


=head2 KeyUsageProperty => L<Paws::PcaConnectorAd::KeyUsageProperty>

The key usage property defines the purpose of the private key contained
in the certificate. You can specify specific purposes using property
flags or all by using property type ALL.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinimalKeyLength => Int

Set the minimum key length of the private key.



=head1 SEE ALSO
