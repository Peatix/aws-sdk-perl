=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::CertificateValidity

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::CertificateValidity object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RenewalPeriod => $value, ..., ValidityPeriod => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::CertificateValidity object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RenewalPeriod

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information describing the end of the validity period of the
certificate. This parameter sets the E<ldquo>Not AfterE<rdquo> date for
the certificate. Certificate validity is the period of time during
which a certificate is valid. Validity can be expressed as an explicit
date and time when the certificate expires, or as a span of time after
issuance, stated in days, months, or years. For more information, see
Validity in RFC 5280. This value is unaffected when ValidityNotBefore
is also specified. For example, if Validity is set to 20 days in the
future, the certificate will expire 20 days from issuance time
regardless of the ValidityNotBefore value.
