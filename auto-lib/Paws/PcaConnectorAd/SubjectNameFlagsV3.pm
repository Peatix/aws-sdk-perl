=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::SubjectNameFlagsV3

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::SubjectNameFlagsV3 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RequireCommonName => $value, ..., SanRequireUpn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::SubjectNameFlagsV3 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RequireCommonName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information to include in the subject name and alternate subject name
of the certificate. The subject name can be common name, directory
path, DNS as common name, or left blank. You can optionally include
email to the subject name for user templates. If you leave the subject
name blank then you must set a subject alternate name. The subject
alternate name (SAN) can include globally unique identifier (GUID),
DNS, domain DNS, email, service principal name (SPN), and user
principal name (UPN). You can leave the SAN blank. If you leave the SAN
blank, then you must set a subject name.
