=head1 NAME

Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV3

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV3 object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ClientVersion => $value, ..., StrongKeyProtectionRequired => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::PcaConnectorAd::PrivateKeyFlagsV3 object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ClientVersion

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Private key flags for v3 templates specify the client compatibility, if
the private key can be exported, if user input is required when using a
private key, and if an alternate signature algorithm should be used.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ClientVersion => Str

Defines the minimum client compatibility.


=head2 ExportableKey => Bool

Allows the private key to be exported.


=head2 RequireAlternateSignatureAlgorithm => Bool

Reguires the PKCS #1 v2.1 signature format for certificates. You should
verify that your CA, objects, and applications can accept this
signature format.


=head2 StrongKeyProtectionRequired => Bool

Requirer user input when using the private key for enrollment.
