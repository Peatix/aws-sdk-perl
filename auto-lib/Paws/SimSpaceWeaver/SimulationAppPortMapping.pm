=head1 NAME

Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppPortMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppPortMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actual => $value, ..., Declared => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppPortMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actual

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of TCP/UDP ports for a custom or service app.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actual => Int

The TCP/UDP port number of the running app. SimSpace Weaver dynamically
assigns this port number when the app starts. SimSpace Weaver maps the
C<Declared> port to the C<Actual> port. Clients connect to the app
using the app's IP address and the C<Actual> port number.


=head2 Declared => Int

The TCP/UDP port number of the app, declared in the simulation schema.
SimSpace Weaver maps the C<Declared> port to the C<Actual> port. The
source code for the app should bind to the C<Declared> port.
