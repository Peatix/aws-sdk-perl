=head1 NAME

Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppEndpointInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppEndpointInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Address => $value, ..., IngressPortMappings => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppEndpointInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Address

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the network endpoint that you can use to connect to
your custom or service app. For more information about SimSpace Weaver
apps, see Key concepts: Apps
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/what-is_key-concepts.html#what-is_key-concepts_apps)
in the I<SimSpace Weaver User Guide>..

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Address => Str

The IP address of the app. SimSpace Weaver dynamically assigns this IP
address when the app starts.


=head2 IngressPortMappings => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationAppPortMapping>]

The inbound TCP/UDP port numbers of the app. The combination of an IP
address and a port number form a network endpoint.
