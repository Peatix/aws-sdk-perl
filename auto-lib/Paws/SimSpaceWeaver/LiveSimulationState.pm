=head1 NAME

Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::LiveSimulationState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::LiveSimulationState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Clocks => $value, ..., Domains => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::LiveSimulationState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Clocks

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of additional state information, such as domain and clock
configuration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Clocks => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::SimulationClock>]

A list of simulation clocks.

At this time, a simulation has only one clock.


=head2 Domains => ArrayRef[L<Paws::SimSpaceWeaver::Domain>]

A list of domains for the simulation. For more information about
domains, see Key concepts: Domains
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/what-is_key-concepts.html#what-is_key-concepts_domains)
in the I<SimSpace Weaver User Guide>.



=head1 SEE ALSO
