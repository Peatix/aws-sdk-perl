=head1 NAME

Paws::CodeDeploy::LoadBalancerInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodeDeploy::LoadBalancerInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ElbInfoList => $value, ..., TargetGroupPairInfoList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodeDeploy::LoadBalancerInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ElbInfoList

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the Elastic Load Balancing load balancer or target
group used in a deployment.

You can use load balancers and target groups in combination. For
example, if you have two Classic Load Balancers, and five target groups
tied to an Application Load Balancer, you can specify the two Classic
Load Balancers in C<elbInfoList>, and the five target groups in
C<targetGroupInfoList>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ElbInfoList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodeDeploy::ELBInfo>]

An array that contains information about the load balancers to use for
load balancing in a deployment. If you're using Classic Load Balancers,
specify those load balancers in this array.

You can add up to 10 load balancers to the array.

If you're using Application Load Balancers or Network Load Balancers,
use the C<targetGroupInfoList> array instead of this one.


=head2 TargetGroupInfoList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodeDeploy::TargetGroupInfo>]

An array that contains information about the target groups to use for
load balancing in a deployment. If you're using Application Load
Balancers and Network Load Balancers, specify their associated target
groups in this array.

You can add up to 10 target groups to the array.

If you're using Classic Load Balancers, use the C<elbInfoList> array
instead of this one.


=head2 TargetGroupPairInfoList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodeDeploy::TargetGroupPairInfo>]

The target group pair information. This is an array of
C<TargeGroupPairInfo> objects with a maximum size of one.
