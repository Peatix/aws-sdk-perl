=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::Container

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::Container object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., Ports => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::Container object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the settings of a container that will be launched, or that is
launched, to an Amazon Lightsail container service.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Command => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The launch command for the container.


=head2 Environment => L<Paws::Lightsail::Environment>

The environment variables of the container.


=head2 Image => Str

The name of the image used for the container.

Container images sourced from your Lightsail container service, that
are registered and stored on your service, start with a colon (C<:>).
For example, if your container service name is C<container-service-1>,
the container image label is C<mystaticsite>, and you want to use the
third (C<3>) version of the registered container image, then you should
specify C<:container-service-1.mystaticsite.3>. To use the latest
version of a container image, specify C<latest> instead of a version
number (for example, C<:container-service-1.mystaticsite.latest>).
Lightsail will automatically use the highest numbered version of the
registered container image.

Container images sourced from a public registry like Docker Hub don't
start with a colon. For example, C<nginx:latest> or C<nginx>.


=head2 Ports => L<Paws::Lightsail::PortMap>

The open firewall ports of the container.
