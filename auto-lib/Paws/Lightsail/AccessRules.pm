=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::AccessRules

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::AccessRules object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowPublicOverrides => $value, ..., GetObject => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::AccessRules object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowPublicOverrides

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the anonymous access permissions for an Amazon Lightsail
bucket and its objects.

For more information about bucket access permissions, see Understanding
bucket permissions in Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-understanding-bucket-permissions)
in the

I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowPublicOverrides => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the access control list (ACL)
permissions that are applied to individual objects override the
C<getObject> option that is currently specified.

When this is true, you can use the PutObjectAcl
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObjectAcl.html)
Amazon S3 API action to set individual objects to public (read-only)
using the C<public-read> ACL, or to private using the C<private> ACL.


=head2 GetObject => Str

Specifies the anonymous access to all objects in a bucket.

The following options can be specified:

=over

=item *

C<public> - Sets all objects in the bucket to public (read-only),
making them readable by anyone in the world.

If the C<getObject> value is set to C<public>, then all objects in the
bucket default to public regardless of the C<allowPublicOverrides>
value.

=item *

C<private> - Sets all objects in the bucket to private, making them
readable only by you or anyone you give access to.

If the C<getObject> value is set to C<private>, and the
C<allowPublicOverrides> value is set to C<true>, then all objects in
the bucket default to private unless they are configured with a
C<public-read> ACL. Individual objects with a C<public-read> ACL are
readable by anyone in the world.
