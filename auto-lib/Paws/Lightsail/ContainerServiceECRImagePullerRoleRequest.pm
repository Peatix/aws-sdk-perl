=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a request to activate or deactivate the role that you can use
to grant an Amazon Lightsail container service access to Amazon Elastic
Container Registry (Amazon ECR) private repositories.

When activated, Lightsail creates an Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role for the specified Lightsail container service. You can use
the ARN of the role to create a trust relationship between your
Lightsail container service and an Amazon ECR private repository in
your Amazon Web Services account. This allows your container service to
pull images from Amazon ECR private repositories. For more information,
see Configuring access to an Amazon ECR private repository for an
Amazon Lightsail container service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-container-service-ecr-private-repo-access)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsActive => Bool
