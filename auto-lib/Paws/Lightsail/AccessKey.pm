=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::AccessKey

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::AccessKey object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccessKeyId => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::AccessKey object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccessKeyId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes an access key for an Amazon Lightsail bucket.

Access keys grant full programmatic access to the specified bucket and
its objects. You can have a maximum of two access keys per bucket. Use
the CreateBucketAccessKey
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/API_CreateBucketAccessKey.html)
action to create an access key for a specific bucket. For more
information about access keys, see Creating access keys for a bucket in
Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-creating-bucket-access-keys)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

The C<secretAccessKey> value is returned only in response to the
C<CreateBucketAccessKey> action. You can get a secret access key only
when you first create an access key; you cannot get the secret access
key later. If you lose the secret access key, you must create a new
access key.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccessKeyId => Str

The ID of the access key.


=head2 CreatedAt => Str

The timestamp when the access key was created.


=head2 LastUsed => L<Paws::Lightsail::AccessKeyLastUsed>

An object that describes the last time the access key was used.

This object does not include data in the response of a
CreateBucketAccessKey
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/2016-11-28/api-reference/API_CreateBucketAccessKey.html)
action. If the access key has not been used, the C<region> and
C<serviceName> values are C<N/A>, and the C<lastUsedDate> value is
null.


=head2 SecretAccessKey => Str

The secret access key used to sign requests.

You should store the secret access key in a safe location. We recommend
that you delete the access key if the secret access key is compromised.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of the access key.

A status of C<Active> means that the key is valid, while C<Inactive>
means it is not.
