=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::RegisteredDomainDelegationInfo

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::RegisteredDomainDelegationInfo object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { NameServersUpdateState => $value, ..., R53HostedZoneDeletionState => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::RegisteredDomainDelegationInfo object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->NameServersUpdateState

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the delegation state of an Amazon Route 53 registered domain
to Amazon Lightsail.

When you delegate an Amazon Route 53 registered domain to Lightsail,
you can manage the DNS of the domain using a Lightsail DNS zone. You no
longer use the Route 53 hosted zone to manage the DNS of the domain. To
delegate the domain, Lightsail automatically updates the domain's name
servers in Route 53 to the name servers of the Lightsail DNS zone.
Then, Lightsail automatically deletes the Route 53 hosted zone for the
domain.

All of the following conditions must be true for automatic domain
delegation to be successful:

=over

=item *

The registered domain must be in the same Amazon Web Services account
as the Lightsail account making the request.

=item *

The user or entity making the request must have permission to manage
domains in Route 53.

=item *

The Route 53 hosted zone for the domain must be empty. It cannot
contain DNS records other than start of authority (SOA) and name server
records.

=back

If automatic domain delegation fails, or if you manage the DNS of your
domain using a service other than Route 53, then you must manually add
the Lightsail DNS zone name servers to your domain in order to delegate
management of its DNS to Lightsail. For more information, see Creating
a DNS zone to manage your domainE<rsquo>s records in Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/lightsail-how-to-create-dns-entry)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.
