=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::BucketAccessLogConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::BucketAccessLogConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Destination => $value, ..., Prefix => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::BucketAccessLogConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Destination

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the access log configuration for a bucket in the Amazon
Lightsail object storage service.

For more information about bucket access logs, see Logging bucket
requests using access logging in Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-bucket-access-logs)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Destination => Str

The name of the bucket where the access logs are saved. The destination
can be a Lightsail bucket in the same account, and in the same Amazon
Web Services Region as the source bucket.

This parameter is required when enabling the access log for a bucket,
and should be omitted when disabling the access log.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Enabled => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether bucket access logging is enabled
for the bucket.


=head2 Prefix => Str

The optional object prefix for the bucket access log.

The prefix is an optional addition to the object key that organizes
your access log files in the destination bucket. For example, if you
specify a C<logs/> prefix, then each log object will begin with the
C<logs/> prefix in its key (for example,
C<logs/2021-11-01-21-32-16-E568B2907131C0C0>).

This parameter can be optionally specified when enabling the access log
for a bucket, and should be omitted when disabling the access log.
