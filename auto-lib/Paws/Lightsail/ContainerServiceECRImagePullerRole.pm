=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::ContainerServiceECRImagePullerRole object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { IsActive => $value, ..., PrincipalArn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::ContainerServiceECRImagePullerRole object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->IsActive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the activation status of the role that you can use to grant
an Amazon Lightsail container service access to Amazon Elastic
Container Registry (Amazon ECR) private repositories.

When activated, Lightsail creates an Identity and Access Management
(IAM) role for the specified Lightsail container service. You can use
the ARN of the role to create a trust relationship between your
Lightsail container service and an Amazon ECR private repository in
your Amazon Web Services account. This allows your container service to
pull images from Amazon ECR private repositories. For more information,
see Configuring access to an Amazon ECR private repository for an
Amazon Lightsail container service
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-container-service-ecr-private-repo-access)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 IsActive => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether the role is activated.


=head2 PrincipalArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role, if it is activated.
