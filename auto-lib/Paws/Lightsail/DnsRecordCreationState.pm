=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::DnsRecordCreationState

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::DnsRecordCreationState object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Code => $value, ..., Message => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::DnsRecordCreationState object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the creation state of the canonical name (CNAME) records that
are automatically added by Amazon Lightsail to the DNS of a domain to
validate domain ownership for an SSL/TLS certificate.

When you create an SSL/TLS certificate for a Lightsail resource, you
must add a set of CNAME records to the DNS of the domains for the
certificate to validate that you own the domains. Lightsail can
automatically add the CNAME records to the DNS of the domain if the DNS
zone for the domain exists within your Lightsail account. If automatic
record addition fails, or if you manage the DNS of your domain using a
third-party service, then you must manually add the CNAME records to
the DNS of your domain. For more information, see Verify an SSL/TLS
certificate in Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/verify-tls-ssl-certificate-using-dns-cname-https)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.
