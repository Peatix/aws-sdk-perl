=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::InstanceMetadataOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::InstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { HttpEndpoint => $value, ..., State => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::InstanceMetadataOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->HttpEndpoint

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metadata options for the instance.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 HttpEndpoint => Str

Indicates whether the HTTP metadata endpoint on your instances is
enabled or disabled.

If the value is C<disabled>, you cannot access your instance metadata.


=head2 HttpProtocolIpv6 => Str

Indicates whether the IPv6 endpoint for the instance metadata service
is enabled or disabled.


=head2 HttpPutResponseHopLimit => Int

The desired HTTP PUT response hop limit for instance metadata requests.
A larger number means that the instance metadata requests can travel
farther.


=head2 HttpTokens => Str

The state of token usage for your instance metadata requests.

If the state is C<optional>, you can choose whether to retrieve
instance metadata with a signed token header on your request. If you
retrieve the IAM role credentials without a token, the version 1.0 role
credentials are returned. If you retrieve the IAM role credentials by
using a valid signed token, the version 2.0 role credentials are
returned.

If the state is C<required>, you must send a signed token header with
all instance metadata retrieval requests. In this state, retrieving the
IAM role credential always returns the version 2.0 credentials. The
version 1.0 credentials are not available.

Not all instance blueprints in Lightsail support version 2.0
credentials. Use the C<MetadataNoToken> instance metric to track the
number of calls to the instance metadata service that are using version
1.0 credentials. For more information, see Viewing instance metrics in
Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-viewing-instance-health-metrics)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.


=head2 State => Str

The state of the metadata option changes.

The following states are possible:

=over

=item *

C<pending> - The metadata options are being updated. The instance is
not yet ready to process metadata traffic with the new selection.

=item *

C<applied> - The metadata options have been successfully applied to the
instance.
