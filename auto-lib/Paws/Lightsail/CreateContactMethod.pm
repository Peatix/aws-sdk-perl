    my $lightsail = Paws->service('Lightsail');
    my $CreateContactMethodResult = $lightsail->CreateContactMethod(
      ContactEndpoint => 'MyStringMax256',
      Protocol        => 'Email',

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ContactEndpoint => Str

The destination of the contact method, such as an email address or a

maximum of 15 digits, and they are prefixed with the plus character (+)
and the country code. For example, a U.S. phone number in E.164 format
would be specified as +1XXX5550100. For more information, see E.164
