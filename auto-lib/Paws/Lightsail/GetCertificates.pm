Paws::Lightsail::GetCertificates - Arguments for method GetCertificates on L<Paws::Lightsail>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetCertificates on the
L<Amazon Lightsail|Paws::Lightsail> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetCertificates.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetCertificates.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $lightsail = Paws->service('Lightsail');
    my $GetCertificatesResult = $lightsail->GetCertificates(
      CertificateName     => 'MyCertificateName',    # OPTIONAL
      CertificateStatuses => [
        'PENDING_VALIDATION',
        ... # values: PENDING_VALIDATION, ISSUED, INACTIVE, EXPIRED, VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT, REVOKED, FAILED
      ],    # OPTIONAL
      IncludeCertificateDetails => 1,             # OPTIONAL
      PageToken                 => 'Mystring',    # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $Certificates  = $GetCertificatesResult->Certificates;
    my $NextPageToken = $GetCertificatesResult->NextPageToken;

    # Returns a L<Paws::Lightsail::GetCertificatesResult> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
