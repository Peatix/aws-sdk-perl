=head1 NAME

Paws::Lightsail::AccountLevelBpaSync

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Lightsail::AccountLevelBpaSync object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BpaImpactsLightsail => $value, ..., Status => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Lightsail::AccountLevelBpaSync object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BpaImpactsLightsail

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes the synchronization status of the Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3) account-level block public access (BPA) feature for
your Lightsail buckets.

The account-level BPA feature of Amazon S3 provides centralized
controls to limit public access to all Amazon S3 buckets in an account.
BPA can make all Amazon S3 buckets in an Amazon Web Services account
private regardless of the individual bucket and object permissions that
are configured. Lightsail buckets take into account the Amazon S3
account-level BPA configuration when allowing or denying public access.
To do this, Lightsail periodically fetches the account-level BPA
configuration from Amazon S3. When the account-level BPA status is
C<InSync>, the Amazon S3 account-level BPA configuration is
synchronized and it applies to your Lightsail buckets. For more
information about Amazon Simple Storage Service account-level BPA and
how it affects Lightsail buckets, see Block public access for buckets
in Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-block-public-access-for-buckets)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BpaImpactsLightsail => Bool

A Boolean value that indicates whether account-level block public
access is affecting your Lightsail buckets.


=head2 LastSyncedAt => Str

The timestamp of when the account-level BPA configuration was last
synchronized. This value is null when the account-level BPA
configuration has not been synchronized.


=head2 Message => Str

A message that provides a reason for a C<Failed> or C<Defaulted>
synchronization status.

The following messages are possible:

=over

=item *

C<SYNC_ON_HOLD> - The synchronization has not yet happened. This status
message occurs immediately after you create your first Lightsail
bucket. This status message should change after the first
synchronization happens, approximately 1 hour after the first bucket is
created.

=item *

C<DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING> - The synchronization failed because the
required service-linked role is missing from your Amazon Web Services
account. The account-level BPA configuration for your Lightsail buckets
is defaulted to I<active> until the synchronization can occur. This
means that all your buckets are private and not publicly accessible.
For more information about how to create the required service-linked
role to allow synchronization, see Using Service-Linked Roles for
Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=item *

C<DEFAULTED_FOR_SLR_MISSING_ON_HOLD> - The synchronization failed
because the required service-linked role is missing from your Amazon
Web Services account. Account-level BPA is not yet configured for your
Lightsail buckets. Therefore, only the bucket access permissions and
individual object access permissions apply to your Lightsail buckets.
For more information about how to create the required service-linked
role to allow synchronization, see Using Service-Linked Roles for
Amazon Lightsail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail/latest/userguide/amazon-lightsail-using-service-linked-roles)
in the I<Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide>.

=item *

C<Unknown> - The reason that synchronization failed is unknown. Contact
Amazon Web ServicesSupport for more information.

=back



=head2 Status => Str

The status of the account-level BPA synchronization.

The following statuses are possible:

=over

=item *

C<InSync> - Account-level BPA is synchronized. The Amazon S3
account-level BPA configuration applies to your Lightsail buckets.

=item *

C<NeverSynced> - Synchronization has not yet happened. The Amazon S3
account-level BPA configuration does not apply to your Lightsail
buckets.

=item *

C<Failed> - Synchronization failed. The Amazon S3 account-level BPA
configuration does not apply to your Lightsail buckets.

=item *

C<Defaulted> - Synchronization failed and account-level BPA for your
Lightsail buckets is defaulted to I<active>.

=back

You might need to complete further actions if the status is C<Failed>
or C<Defaulted>. The C<message> parameter provides more information for
those statuses.
