=head1 NAME

Paws::CodePipeline::PipelineSummary

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodePipeline::PipelineSummary object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Created => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodePipeline::PipelineSummary object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Created

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Returns a summary of a pipeline.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Created => Str

The date and time the pipeline was created, in timestamp format.


=head2 ExecutionMode => Str

The method that the pipeline will use to handle multiple executions.
The default mode is SUPERSEDED.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the pipeline.


=head2 PipelineType => Str

CodePipeline provides the following pipeline types, which differ in
characteristics and price, so that you can tailor your pipeline
features and cost to the needs of your applications.

=over

=item *

V1 type pipelines have a JSON structure that contains standard
pipeline, stage, and action-level parameters.

=item *

V2 type pipelines have the same structure as a V1 type, along with
additional parameters for release safety and trigger configuration.

=back

Including V2 parameters, such as triggers on Git tags, in the pipeline
JSON when creating or updating a pipeline will result in the pipeline
having the V2 type of pipeline and the associated costs.

For information about which type of pipeline to choose, see What type
of pipeline is right for me?
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-types-planning.html).


=head2 Updated => Str

The date and time of the last update to the pipeline, in timestamp
format.


=head2 Version => Int
