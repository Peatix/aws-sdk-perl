=head1 NAME

Paws::CodePipeline::StageDeclaration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodePipeline::StageDeclaration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actions => $value, ..., OnSuccess => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodePipeline::StageDeclaration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents information about a stage and its definition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Actions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodePipeline::ActionDeclaration>]

The actions included in a stage.


=head2 BeforeEntry => L<Paws::CodePipeline::BeforeEntryConditions>

The method to use when a stage allows entry. For example, configuring
this field for conditions will allow entry to the stage when the
conditions are met.


=head2 Blockers => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CodePipeline::BlockerDeclaration>]

Reserved for future use.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the stage.


=head2 OnFailure => L<Paws::CodePipeline::FailureConditions>

The method to use when a stage has not completed successfully. For
example, configuring this field for rollback will roll back a failed
stage automatically to the last successful pipeline execution in the
stage.


=head2 OnSuccess => L<Paws::CodePipeline::SuccessConditions>

The method to use when a stage has succeeded. For example, configuring
this field for conditions will allow the stage to succeed when the
conditions are met.



=head1 SEE ALSO
