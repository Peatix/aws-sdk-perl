=head1 NAME

Paws::CodePipeline::GetActionType - Arguments for method GetActionType on L<Paws::CodePipeline>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method GetActionType on the
L<AWS CodePipeline|Paws::CodePipeline> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method GetActionType.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to GetActionType.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $codepipeline = Paws->service('CodePipeline');
    my $GetActionTypeOutput = $codepipeline->GetActionType(
      Category => 'Source',
      Owner    => 'MyActionTypeOwner',
      Provider => 'MyActionProvider',
      Version  => 'MyVersion',

    );

    # Results:
    my $ActionType = $GetActionTypeOutput->ActionType;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CodePipeline::GetActionTypeOutput> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
