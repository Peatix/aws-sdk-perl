=head1 NAME

Paws::CodePipeline::WebhookAuthConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodePipeline::WebhookAuthConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedIPRange => $value, ..., SecretToken => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodePipeline::WebhookAuthConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedIPRange

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The authentication applied to incoming webhook trigger requests.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedIPRange => Str

The property used to configure acceptance of webhooks in an IP address
range. For IP, only the C<AllowedIPRange> property must be set. This
property must be set to a valid CIDR range.


=head2 SecretToken => Str

The property used to configure GitHub authentication. For GITHUB_HMAC,
only the C<SecretToken> property must be set.

When creating CodePipeline webhooks, do not use your own credentials or
reuse the same secret token across multiple webhooks. For optimal
security, generate a unique secret token for each webhook you create.
The secret token is an arbitrary string that you provide, which GitHub
uses to compute and sign the webhook payloads sent to CodePipeline, for
protecting the integrity and authenticity of the webhook payloads.
Using your own credentials or reusing the same token across multiple
webhooks can lead to security vulnerabilities.

If a secret token was provided, it will be redacted in the response.
