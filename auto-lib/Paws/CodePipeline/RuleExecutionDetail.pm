=head1 NAME

Paws::CodePipeline::RuleExecutionDetail

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CodePipeline::RuleExecutionDetail object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Input => $value, ..., UpdatedBy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CodePipeline::RuleExecutionDetail object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Input

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The details of the runs for a rule and the results produced on an
artifact as it passes through stages in the pipeline.

timestamp format.


=head2 Output => L<Paws::CodePipeline::RuleExecutionOutput>

Output details for the rule execution, such as the rule execution
result.


=head2 PipelineExecutionId => Str

The ID of the pipeline execution in the stage where the rule was run.
Use the GetPipelineState action to retrieve the current
pipelineExecutionId of the stage.


=head2 PipelineVersion => Int
