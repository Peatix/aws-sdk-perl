configurations, notifications, user inputs, AWS Chatbot generated
responses, and interaction data. This data helps us to continuously
improve and develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Your

sophisticated controls to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. AWS
Chatbot does not store or use interactions in chat channels with Amazon
Q for training AI technologies for AWS Chatbot.
