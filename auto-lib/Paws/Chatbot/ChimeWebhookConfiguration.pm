=head1 NAME

Paws::Chatbot::ChimeWebhookConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Chatbot::ChimeWebhookConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ChatConfigurationArn => $value, ..., WebhookDescription => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Chatbot::ChimeWebhookConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ChatConfigurationArn

The name of the configuration.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> IamRoleArn => Str

A user-defined role that AWS Chatbot assumes. This is not the

The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the SNS topics that deliver
notifications to AWS Chatbot.

the organization's AWS Chatbot policy has explicitly denied that

Provided if State is C<DISABLED>. Provides context as to why the
resource is disabled.

A map of tags assigned to a resource. A tag is a string-to-string map
of key-value pairs.

C<RoomName/WebhookName>.
