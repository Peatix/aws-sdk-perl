=head1 NAME

Paws::HealthLake::IdentityProviderConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::HealthLake::IdentityProviderConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthorizationStrategy => $value, ..., Metadata => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::HealthLake::IdentityProviderConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthorizationStrategy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The identity provider configuration that you gave when the data store
was created.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> AuthorizationStrategy => Str

=head2 IdpLambdaArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function that you want to
use to decode the access token created by the authorization server.


=head2 Metadata => Str

The JSON metadata elements that you want to use in your identity
provider configuration. Required elements are listed based on the
