          S3Uri    => 'MyS3Uri',              # max: 1024

      ClientToken => 'MyClientTokenString',    # OPTIONAL
      JobName     => 'MyJobName',              # OPTIONAL
    );

    # Results:
    my $DatastoreId = $StartFHIRExportJobResponse->DatastoreId;
    my $JobId       = $StartFHIRExportJobResponse->JobId;
    my $JobStatus   = $StartFHIRExportJobResponse->JobStatus;
