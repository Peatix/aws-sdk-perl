=head1 NAME

Paws::XRay::TagResource - Arguments for method TagResource on L<Paws::XRay>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method TagResource on the
L<AWS X-Ray|Paws::XRay> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method TagResource.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to TagResource.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $xray = Paws->service('XRay');
    my $TagResourceResponse = $xray->TagResource(
      ResourceARN => 'MyAmazonResourceName',
      Tags        => [
        {
          Key   => 'MyTagKey',      # min: 1, max: 128
          Value => 'MyTagValue',    # max: 256

        },
        ...
      ],

    );

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/xray/TagResource>
