=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::Sensor

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::Sensor object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedValues => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::Sensor object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedValues

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An input component that reports the environmental condition of a
vehicle.

You can collect data about fluid levels, temperatures, vibrations, or
battery voltage from sensors.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllowedValues => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of possible values a sensor can take.


=head2 Comment => Str

A comment in addition to the description.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataType => Str

The specified data type of the sensor.


=head2 DeprecationMessage => Str

The deprecation message for the node or the branch that was moved or
deleted.


=head2 Description => Str

A brief description of a sensor.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FullyQualifiedName => Str
