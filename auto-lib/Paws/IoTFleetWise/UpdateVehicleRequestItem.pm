=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::UpdateVehicleRequestItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::UpdateVehicleRequestItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Attributes => $value, ..., VehicleName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::UpdateVehicleRequestItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Attributes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about the vehicle to update.

Access to certain Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise features is
currently gated. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Region

in the I<Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Attributes => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::AttributesMap>

Static information about a vehicle in a key-value pair. For example:

C<"engineType"> : C<"1.3 L R2">


=head2 AttributeUpdateMode => Str

The method the specified attributes will update the existing attributes
on the vehicle. UseC<Overwite> to replace the vehicle attributes with
the specified attributes. Or use C<Merge> to combine all attributes.

This is required if attributes are present in the input.


=head2 DecoderManifestArn => Str

The ARN of the signal decoder manifest associated with the vehicle to
update.


=head2 ModelManifestArn => Str

The ARN of the vehicle model (model manifest) associated with the
vehicle to update.


=head2 StateTemplatesToAdd => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::StateTemplateAssociation>]

Associate additional state templates to track the state of the vehicle.
State templates determine which signal updates the vehicle sends to the
cloud.


=head2 StateTemplatesToRemove => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Remove existing state template associations from the vehicle.


=head2 StateTemplatesToUpdate => ArrayRef[L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::StateTemplateAssociation>]

Change the C<stateTemplateUpdateStrategy> of state templates already
associated with the vehicle.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> VehicleName => Str

The unique ID of the vehicle to update.
