=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::DataPartitionStorageOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::DataPartitionStorageOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { MaximumSize => $value, ..., StorageLocation => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::DataPartitionStorageOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->MaximumSize

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Size, time, and location options for the data partition.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MaximumSize => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::StorageMaximumSize>

The maximum storage size of the data stored in the data partition.

Newer data overwrites older data when the partition reaches the maximum
size.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> MinimumTimeToLive => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::StorageMinimumTimeToLive>

The amount of time that data in this partition will be kept on disk.

=over

=item *

After the designated amount of time passes, the data can be removed,
but it's not guaranteed to be removed.

=item *

Before the time expires, data in this partition can still be deleted if
