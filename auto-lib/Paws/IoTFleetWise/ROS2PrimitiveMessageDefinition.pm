=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::ROS2PrimitiveMessageDefinition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::ROS2PrimitiveMessageDefinition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Offset => $value, ..., UpperBound => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::ROS2PrimitiveMessageDefinition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Offset

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a ROS 2 compliant primitive type message of the complex data
structure.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Offset => Num

The offset used to calculate the signal value. Combined with scaling,
the calculation is C<value = raw_value * scaling + offset>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimitiveType => Str

The primitive type (integer, floating point, boolean, etc.) for the ROS
2 primitive message definition.


=head2 Scaling => Num

A multiplier used to decode the message.


=head2 UpperBound => Int

An optional attribute specifying the upper bound for C<STRING> and
C<WSTRING>.
