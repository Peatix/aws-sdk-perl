=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::Actuator

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::Actuator object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowedValues => $value, ..., Unit => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::Actuator object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowedValues

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A signal that represents a vehicle device such as the engine, heater,
and door locks. Data from an actuator reports the state of a certain
vehicle device.

Updating actuator data can change the state of a device. For example,
you can turn on or off the heater by updating its actuator data.

A list of possible values an actuator can take.


=head2 AssignedValue => Str

A specified value for the actuator.


=head2 Comment => Str

A comment in addition to the description.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DataType => Str

The specified data type of the actuator.


=head2 DeprecationMessage => Str

The deprecation message for the node or the branch that was moved or
deleted.


=head2 Description => Str

A brief description of the actuator.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FullyQualifiedName => Str

The fully qualified name of the actuator. For example, the fully
qualified name of an actuator might be C<Vehicle.Front.Left.Door.Lock>.


=head2 Max => Num

The specified possible maximum value of an actuator.


=head2 Min => Num

The specified possible minimum value of an actuator.


=head2 StructFullyQualifiedName => Str

The fully qualified name of the struct node for the actuator if the
data type of the actuator is C<Struct> or C<StructArray>. For example,
the struct fully qualified name of an actuator might be
C<Vehicle.Door.LockStruct>.
