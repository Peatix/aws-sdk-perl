=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::Node

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::Node object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Actuator => $value, ..., Struct => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::Node object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Actuator

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A general abstraction of a signal. A node can be specified as an
actuator, attribute, branch, or sensor.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Actuator => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::Actuator>

Information about a node specified as an actuator.

An actuator is a digital representation of a vehicle device.


=head2 Attribute => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::Attribute>

Information about a node specified as an attribute.

An attribute represents static information about a vehicle.


=head2 Branch => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::Branch>

Information about a node specified as a branch.

A group of signals that are defined in a hierarchical structure.


=head2 Property => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CustomProperty>

Represents a member of the complex data structure. The C<datatype> of
the property can be either primitive or another C<struct>.


=head2 Sensor => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::Sensor>




=head2 Struct => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CustomStruct>

Represents a complex or higher-order data structure.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::IoTFleetWise>
