=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalDecoder

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalDecoder object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CanSignal => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalDecoder object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CanSignal

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a signal decoder.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CanSignal => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CanSignal>

Information about signal decoder using the Controller Area Network
(CAN) protocol.


=head2 CustomDecodingSignal => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CustomDecodingSignal>

Information about a custom signal decoder
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_CustomDecodingSignal.html).

Access to certain Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise features is
currently gated. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Region
and feature availability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/developerguide/fleetwise-regions.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> FullyQualifiedName => Str

The fully qualified name of a signal decoder as defined in a vehicle
model.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InterfaceId => Str

The ID of a network interface that specifies what network protocol a
vehicle follows.


=head2 MessageSignal => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::MessageSignal>

The decoding information for a specific message which supports higher
order data types.


=head2 ObdSignal => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::ObdSignal>

Information about signal decoder using the on-board diagnostic (OBD) II
protocol.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The network protocol for the vehicle. For example, C<CAN_SIGNAL>
specifies a protocol that defines how data is communicated between
electronic control units (ECUs). C<OBD_SIGNAL> specifies a protocol
that defines how self-diagnostic data is communicated between ECUs.
