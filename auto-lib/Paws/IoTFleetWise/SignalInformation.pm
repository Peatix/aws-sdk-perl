=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalInformation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalInformation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataPartitionId => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::SignalInformation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataPartitionId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about a signal.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataPartitionId => Str

The ID of the data partition this signal is associated with.

The ID must match one of the IDs provided in C<dataPartitions>. This is
accomplished either by specifying a particular data partition ID or by
using C<default> for an established default partition. You can
establish a default partition in the C<DataPartition> data type.

If you upload a signal as a condition for a campaign's data partition,
the same signal must be included in C<signalsToCollect>.

Access to certain Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise features is
currently gated. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Region
and feature availability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/developerguide/fleetwise-regions.html)
in the I<Amazon Web Services IoT FleetWise Developer Guide>.


=head2 MaxSampleCount => Int

The maximum number of samples to collect.


=head2 MinimumSamplingIntervalMs => Int

The minimum duration of time (in milliseconds) between two triggering
events to collect data.

If a signal changes often, you might want to collect data at a slower
rate.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the signal.
