  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AssociationBehavior => $value, ..., VehicleName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::CreateVehicleRequestItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AssociationBehavior
