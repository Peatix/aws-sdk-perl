=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::NetworkInterface

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::NetworkInterface object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CanInterface => $value, ..., VehicleMiddleware => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::NetworkInterface object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CanInterface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents a node and its specifications in an in-vehicle communication
network. All signal decoders must be associated with a network node.

To return this information about all the network interfaces specified
in a decoder manifest, use the API operation.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CanInterface => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CanInterface>

Information about a network interface specified by the Controller Area
Network (CAN) protocol.


=head2 CustomDecodingInterface => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::CustomDecodingInterface>

Information about a custom network interface
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/latest/APIReference/API_CustomDecodingInterface.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> InterfaceId => Str

The ID of the network interface.


=head2 ObdInterface => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::ObdInterface>

Information about a network interface specified by the on-board
diagnostic (OBD) II protocol.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The network protocol for the vehicle. For example, C<CAN_SIGNAL>
specifies a protocol that defines how data is communicated between
electronic control units (ECUs). C<OBD_SIGNAL> specifies a protocol
that defines how self-diagnostic data is communicated between ECUs.


=head2 VehicleMiddleware => L<Paws::IoTFleetWise::VehicleMiddleware>

The vehicle middleware defined as a type of network interface. Examples
of vehicle middleware include C<ROS2> and C<SOME/IP>.
