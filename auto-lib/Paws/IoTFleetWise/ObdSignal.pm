=head1 NAME

Paws::IoTFleetWise::ObdSignal

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::IoTFleetWise::ObdSignal object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BitMaskLength => $value, ..., StartByte => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::IoTFleetWise::ObdSignal object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BitMaskLength

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Information about signal messages using the on-board diagnostics (OBD)
II protocol in a vehicle.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BitMaskLength => Int

The number of bits to mask in a message.


=head2 BitRightShift => Int

The number of positions to shift bits in the message.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ByteLength => Int

The length of a message.


=head2 IsSigned => Bool

Determines whether the message is signed (C<true>) or not (C<false>).
If it's signed, the message can represent both positive and negative
numbers. The C<isSigned> parameter only applies to the C<INTEGER> raw
signal type, and it doesn't affect the C<FLOATING_POINT> raw signal
type. The default value is C<false>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Offset => Num

The offset used to calculate the signal value. Combined with scaling,
the calculation is C<value = raw_value * scaling + offset>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Pid => Int

The diagnostic code used to request data from a vehicle for this
signal.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PidResponseLength => Int

The length of the requested data.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Scaling => Num

A multiplier used to decode the message.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ServiceMode => Int

The mode of operation (diagnostic service) in a message.


=head2 SignalValueType => Str

The value type of the signal. The default value is C<INTEGER>.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> StartByte => Int

Indicates the beginning of the message.
