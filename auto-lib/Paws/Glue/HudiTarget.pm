=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::HudiTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::HudiTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConnectionName => $value, ..., Paths => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::HudiTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConnectionName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies an Apache Hudi data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConnectionName => Str

The name of the connection to use to connect to the Hudi target. If
your Hudi files are stored in buckets that require VPC authorization,
you can set their connection properties here.


=head2 Exclusions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of glob patterns used to exclude from the crawl. For more
information, see Catalog Tables with a Crawler
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-crawler.html).


=head2 MaximumTraversalDepth => Int

The maximum depth of Amazon S3 paths that the crawler can traverse to
discover the Hudi metadata folder in your Amazon S3 path. Used to limit
the crawler run time.


=head2 Paths => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An array of Amazon S3 location strings for Hudi, each indicating the
root folder with which the metadata files for a Hudi table resides. The
Hudi folder may be located in a child folder of the root folder.

The crawler will scan all folders underneath a path for a Hudi folder.
