=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::KinesisStreamingSourceOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::KinesisStreamingSourceOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddIdleTimeBetweenReads => $value, ..., StreamName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::KinesisStreamingSourceOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddIdleTimeBetweenReads

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additional options for the Amazon Kinesis streaming data source.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddIdleTimeBetweenReads => Bool

Adds a time delay between two consecutive getRecords operations. The
default value is C<"False">. This option is only configurable for Glue
version 2.0 and above.


=head2 AddRecordTimestamp => Str

When this option is set to 'true', the data output will contain an
additional column named "__src_timestamp" that indicates the time when
the corresponding record received by the stream. The default value is
'false'. This option is supported in Glue version 4.0 or later.


=head2 AvoidEmptyBatches => Bool

Avoids creating an empty microbatch job by checking for unread data in
the Kinesis data stream before the batch is started. The default value
is C<"False">.


=head2 Classification => Str

An optional classification.


=head2 Delimiter => Str

Specifies the delimiter character.


=head2 DescribeShardInterval => Int

The minimum time interval between two ListShards API calls for your
script to consider resharding. The default value is C<1s>.


=head2 EmitConsumerLagMetrics => Str

When this option is set to 'true', for each batch, it will emit the
metrics for the duration between the oldest record received by the
stream and the time it arrives in Glue to CloudWatch. The metric's name
is "glue.driver.streaming.maxConsumerLagInMs". The default value is
'false'. This option is supported in Glue version 4.0 or later.


=head2 EndpointUrl => Str

The URL of the Kinesis endpoint.


=head2 IdleTimeBetweenReadsInMs => Int

The minimum time delay between two consecutive getRecords operations,
specified in ms. The default value is C<1000>. This option is only
configurable for Glue version 2.0 and above.


=head2 MaxFetchRecordsPerShard => Int

The maximum number of records to fetch per shard in the Kinesis data
stream per microbatch. Note: The client can exceed this limit if the
streaming job has already read extra records from Kinesis (in the same
get-records call). If C<MaxFetchRecordsPerShard> needs to be strict
then it needs to be a multiple of C<MaxRecordPerRead>. The default
value is C<100000>.


=head2 MaxFetchTimeInMs => Int

The maximum time spent for the job executor to read records for the
current batch from the Kinesis data stream, specified in milliseconds
(ms). Multiple C<GetRecords> API calls may be made within this time.
The default value is C<1000>.


=head2 MaxRecordPerRead => Int

The maximum number of records to fetch from the Kinesis data stream in
each getRecords operation. The default value is C<10000>.


=head2 MaxRetryIntervalMs => Int

The maximum cool-off time period (specified in ms) between two retries
of a Kinesis Data Streams API call. The default value is C<10000>.


=head2 NumRetries => Int

The maximum number of retries for Kinesis Data Streams API requests.
The default value is C<3>.


=head2 RetryIntervalMs => Int

The cool-off time period (specified in ms) before retrying the Kinesis
Data Streams API call. The default value is C<1000>.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume using AWS Security
Token Service (AWS STS). This role must have permissions for describe
or read record operations for the Kinesis data stream. You must use
this parameter when accessing a data stream in a different account.
Used in conjunction with C<"awsSTSSessionName">.


=head2 RoleSessionName => Str

An identifier for the session assuming the role using AWS STS. You must
use this parameter when accessing a data stream in a different account.
Used in conjunction with C<"awsSTSRoleARN">.


=head2 StartingPosition => Str

The starting position in the Kinesis data stream to read data from. The
possible values are C<"latest">, C<"trim_horizon">, C<"earliest">, or a
timestamp string in UTC format in the pattern C<yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ>
(where C<Z> represents a UTC timezone offset with a +/-. For example:
"2023-04-04T08:00:00-04:00"). The default value is C<"latest">.

Note: Using a value that is a timestamp string in UTC format for
"startingPosition" is supported only for Glue version 4.0 or later.


=head2 StartingTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of the record in the Kinesis data stream to start reading
data from. The possible values are a timestamp string in UTC format of
the pattern C<yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ> (where Z represents a UTC timezone
offset with a +/-. For example: "2023-04-04T08:00:00+08:00").


=head2 StreamArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Kinesis data stream.


=head2 StreamName => Str

The name of the Kinesis data stream.
