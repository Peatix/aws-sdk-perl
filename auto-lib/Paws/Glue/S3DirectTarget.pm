=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::S3DirectTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::S3DirectTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Compression => $value, ..., SchemaChangePolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::S3DirectTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Compression

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a data target that writes to Amazon S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Compression => Str

Specifies how the data is compressed. This is generally not necessary
if the data has a standard file extension. Possible values are
C<"gzip"> and C<"bzip">).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Format => Str

Specifies the data output format for the target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The nodes that are inputs to the data target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the data target.


=head2 NumberTargetPartitions => Str

Specifies the number of target partitions when writing data directly to
Amazon S3.


=head2 PartitionKeys => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Str|Undef]]

Specifies native partitioning using a sequence of keys.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Path => Str

A single Amazon S3 path to write to.


=head2 SchemaChangePolicy => L<Paws::Glue::DirectSchemaChangePolicy>

A policy that specifies update behavior for the crawler.
