=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Workflow

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Workflow object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BlueprintDetails => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Workflow object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BlueprintDetails

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A workflow is a collection of multiple dependent Glue jobs and crawlers
that are run to complete a complex ETL task. A workflow manages the
execution and monitoring of all its jobs and crawlers.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BlueprintDetails => L<Paws::Glue::BlueprintDetails>

This structure indicates the details of the blueprint that this
particular workflow is created from.


=head2 CreatedOn => Str

The date and time when the workflow was created.


=head2 DefaultRunProperties => L<Paws::Glue::WorkflowRunProperties>

A collection of properties to be used as part of each execution of the
workflow. The run properties are made available to each job in the
workflow. A job can modify the properties for the next jobs in the
flow.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the workflow.


=head2 Graph => L<Paws::Glue::WorkflowGraph>

The graph representing all the Glue components that belong to the
workflow as nodes and directed connections between them as edges.


=head2 LastModifiedOn => Str

The date and time when the workflow was last modified.


=head2 LastRun => L<Paws::Glue::WorkflowRun>

The information about the last execution of the workflow.


=head2 MaxConcurrentRuns => Int

You can use this parameter to prevent unwanted multiple updates to
data, to control costs, or in some cases, to prevent exceeding the
maximum number of concurrent runs of any of the component jobs. If you
leave this parameter blank, there is no limit to the number of
concurrent workflow runs.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the workflow.



=head1 SEE ALSO
