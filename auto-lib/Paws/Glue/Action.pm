=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Action

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Action object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arguments => $value, ..., Timeout => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Action object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arguments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines an action to be initiated by a trigger.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arguments => L<Paws::Glue::GenericMap>

The job arguments used when this trigger fires. For this job run, they
replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself.

You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script
consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

For information about how to specify and consume your own Job
arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html)
topic in the developer guide.

For information about the key-value pairs that Glue consumes to set up
your job, see the Special Parameters Used by Glue
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html)
topic in the developer guide.


=head2 CrawlerName => Str

The name of the crawler to be used with this action.


=head2 JobName => Str

The name of a job to be run.


=head2 NotificationProperty => L<Paws::Glue::NotificationProperty>

Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.


=head2 SecurityConfiguration => Str

The name of the C<SecurityConfiguration> structure to be used with this
action.


=head2 Timeout => Int

The C<JobRun> timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job
run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters C<TIMEOUT>
status. This overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

Jobs must have timeout values less than 7 days or 10080 minutes.
Otherwise, the jobs will throw an exception.

When the value is left blank, the timeout is defaulted to 2880 minutes.

Any existing Glue jobs that had a timeout value greater than 7 days
will be defaulted to 7 days. For instance if you have specified a
timeout of 20 days for a batch job, it will be stopped on the 7th day.

For streaming jobs, if you have set up a maintenance window, it will be
restarted during the maintenance window after 7 days.
