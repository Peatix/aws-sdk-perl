=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::ComputeEnvironmentConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::ComputeEnvironmentConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComputeEnvironment => $value, ..., SupportedAuthenticationTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::ComputeEnvironmentConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComputeEnvironment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object containing configuration for a compute environment (such as
Spark, Python or Athena) returned by the C<DescribeConnectionType> API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComputeEnvironment => Str

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Description => Str

A description of the compute environment.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

A name for the compute environment configuration.


=head2 PhysicalConnectionPropertiesRequired => Bool

Indicates whether C<PhysicalConnectionProperties> are required for the
compute environment.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SupportedAuthenticationTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]
