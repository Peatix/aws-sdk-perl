=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::S3IcebergDirectTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::S3IcebergDirectTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalOptions => $value, ..., SchemaChangePolicy => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::S3IcebergDirectTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalOptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a target that writes to an Iceberg data source in Amazon S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalOptions => L<Paws::Glue::AdditionalOptions>

Provides additional configuration options for customizing the Iceberg
table behavior.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Compression => Str

Specifies the compression codec used for Iceberg table files in S3.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Format => Str

Specifies the file format used for storing Iceberg table data (e.g.,
Parquet, ORC).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Defines the single input source that provides data to this Iceberg
target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

Specifies the unique identifier for the Iceberg target node in your
data pipeline.


=head2 NumberTargetPartitions => Str

Sets the number of target partitions for distributing Iceberg table
files across S3.


=head2 PartitionKeys => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Str|Undef]]

Specifies the columns used to partition the Iceberg table data in S3.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Path => Str

Defines the S3 location where the Iceberg table data will be stored.


=head2 SchemaChangePolicy => L<Paws::Glue::DirectSchemaChangePolicy>

Defines how schema changes are handled when writing data to the Iceberg
table.
