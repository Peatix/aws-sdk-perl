=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::DropNullFields

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::DropNullFields object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inputs => $value, ..., NullTextList => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::DropNullFields object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inputs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a transform that removes columns from the dataset if all
values in the column are 'null'. By default, Glue Studio will recognize
null objects, but some values such as empty strings, strings that are
"null", -1 integers or other placeholders such as zeros, are not
automatically recognized as nulls.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The data inputs identified by their node names.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the transform node.


=head2 NullCheckBoxList => L<Paws::Glue::NullCheckBoxList>

A structure that represents whether certain values are recognized as
null values for removal.


=head2 NullTextList => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::NullValueField>]

A structure that specifies a list of NullValueField structures that
represent a custom null value such as zero or other value being used as
a null placeholder unique to the dataset.

The C<DropNullFields> transform removes custom null values only if both
the value of the null placeholder and the datatype match the data.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Glue>
