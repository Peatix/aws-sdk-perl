=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::DataQualityResult

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::DataQualityResult object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AnalyzerResults => $value, ..., StartedOn => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::DataQualityResult object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AnalyzerResults

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Describes a data quality result.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AnalyzerResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::DataQualityAnalyzerResult>]

A list of C<DataQualityAnalyzerResult> objects representing the results
for each analyzer.


=head2 CompletedOn => Str

The date and time when this data quality run completed.


=head2 DataSource => L<Paws::Glue::DataSource>

The table associated with the data quality result, if any.


=head2 EvaluationContext => Str

In the context of a job in Glue Studio, each node in the canvas is
typically assigned some sort of name and data quality nodes will have
names. In the case of multiple nodes, the C<evaluationContext> can
differentiate the nodes.


=head2 JobName => Str

The job name associated with the data quality result, if any.


=head2 JobRunId => Str

The job run ID associated with the data quality result, if any.


=head2 Observations => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::DataQualityObservation>]

A list of C<DataQualityObservation> objects representing the
observations generated after evaluating the rules and analyzers.


=head2 ProfileId => Str

The Profile ID for the data quality result.


=head2 ResultId => Str

A unique result ID for the data quality result.


=head2 RuleResults => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::DataQualityRuleResult>]

A list of C<DataQualityRuleResult> objects representing the results for
each rule.


=head2 RulesetEvaluationRunId => Str

The unique run ID for the ruleset evaluation for this data quality
result.


=head2 RulesetName => Str

The name of the ruleset associated with the data quality result.


=head2 Score => Num

An aggregate data quality score. Represents the ratio of rules that
passed to the total number of rules.


=head2 StartedOn => Str

The date and time when this data quality run started.
