=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Catalog

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Catalog object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllowFullTableExternalDataAccess => $value, ..., UpdateTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Catalog object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllowFullTableExternalDataAccess

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The catalog object represents a logical grouping of databases in the
Glue Data Catalog or a federated source. You can now create a
Redshift-federated catalog or a catalog containing resource links to
Redshift databases in another account or region.
