=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::CrawlsFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::CrawlsFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldName => $value, ..., FilterOperator => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::CrawlsFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list of fields, comparators and value that you can use to filter the
crawler runs for a specified crawler.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FieldName => Str

A key used to filter the crawler runs for a specified crawler. Valid
values for each of the field names are:

=over

=item *

C<CRAWL_ID>: A string representing the UUID identifier for a crawl.

=item *

C<STATE>: A string representing the state of the crawl.

=item *

C<START_TIME> and C<END_TIME>: The epoch timestamp in milliseconds.

=item *

C<DPU_HOUR>: The number of data processing unit (DPU) hours used for
the crawl.

=back



=head2 FieldValue => Str

The value provided for comparison on the crawl field.


=head2 FilterOperator => Str

A defined comparator that operates on the value. The available
operators are:

=over

=item *

C<GT>: Greater than.

=item *

C<GE>: Greater than or equal to.

=item *

C<LT>: Less than.

=item *

C<LE>: Less than or equal to.

=item *

C<EQ>: Equal to.
