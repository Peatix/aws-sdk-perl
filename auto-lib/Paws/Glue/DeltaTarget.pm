=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::DeltaTarget

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::DeltaTarget object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConnectionName => $value, ..., WriteManifest => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::DeltaTarget object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConnectionName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a Delta data store to crawl one or more Delta tables.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConnectionName => Str

The name of the connection to use to connect to the Delta table target.


=head2 CreateNativeDeltaTable => Bool

Specifies whether the crawler will create native tables, to allow
integration with query engines that support querying of the Delta
transaction log directly.


=head2 DeltaTables => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the Amazon S3 paths to the Delta tables.


=head2 WriteManifest => Bool

Specifies whether to write the manifest files to the Delta table path.
