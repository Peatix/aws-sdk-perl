=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::IntegrationPartition

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::IntegrationPartition object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldName => $value, ..., FunctionSpec => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::IntegrationPartition object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldName

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that describes how data is partitioned on the target.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 FieldName => Str

The field name used to partition data on the target. Avoid using
columns that have unique values for each row (for example,
`LastModifiedTimestamp`, `SystemModTimeStamp`) as the partition column.
These columns are not suitable for partitioning because they create a
large number of small partitions, which can lead to performance issues.


=head2 FunctionSpec => Str

Specifies the function used to partition data on the target. The only
accepted value for this parameter is `'identity'` (string). The
`'identity'` function ensures that the data partitioning on the target
follows the same scheme as the source. In other words, the partitioning
structure of the source data is preserved in the target destination.
