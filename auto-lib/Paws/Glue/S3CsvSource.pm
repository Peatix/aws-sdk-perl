=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::S3CsvSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::S3CsvSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalOptions => $value, ..., WriteHeader => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::S3CsvSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalOptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a command-separated value (CSV) data store stored in Amazon
S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalOptions => L<Paws::Glue::S3DirectSourceAdditionalOptions>

Specifies additional connection options.


=head2 CompressionType => Str

Specifies how the data is compressed. This is generally not necessary
if the data has a standard file extension. Possible values are
C<"gzip"> and C<"bzip">).


=head2 Escaper => Str

Specifies a character to use for escaping. This option is used only
when reading CSV files. The default value is C<none>. If enabled, the
character which immediately follows is used as-is, except for a small
set of well-known escapes (C<\n>, C<\r>, C<\t>, and C<\0>).


=head2 Exclusions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A string containing a JSON list of Unix-style glob patterns to exclude.
For example, "[\"**.pdf\"]" excludes all PDF files.


=head2 GroupFiles => Str

Grouping files is turned on by default when the input contains more
than 50,000 files. To turn on grouping with fewer than 50,000 files,
set this parameter to "inPartition". To disable grouping when there are
more than 50,000 files, set this parameter to C<"none">.


=head2 GroupSize => Str

The target group size in bytes. The default is computed based on the
input data size and the size of your cluster. When there are fewer than
50,000 input files, C<"groupFiles"> must be set to C<"inPartition"> for
this to take effect.


=head2 MaxBand => Int

This option controls the duration in milliseconds after which the s3
listing is likely to be consistent. Files with modification timestamps
falling within the last maxBand milliseconds are tracked specially when
using JobBookmarks to account for Amazon S3 eventual consistency. Most
users don't need to set this option. The default is 900000
milliseconds, or 15 minutes.


=head2 MaxFilesInBand => Int

This option specifies the maximum number of files to save from the last
maxBand seconds. If this number is exceeded, extra files are skipped
and only processed in the next job run.


=head2 Multiline => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether a single record can span
multiple lines. This can occur when a field contains a quoted new-line
character. You must set this option to True if any record spans
multiple lines. The default value is C<False>, which allows for more
aggressive file-splitting during parsing.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the data store.


=head2 OptimizePerformance => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether to use the advanced SIMD CSV
reader along with Apache Arrow based columnar memory formats. Only
available in Glue version 3.0.


=head2 OutputSchemas => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::GlueSchema>]

Specifies the data schema for the S3 CSV source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Paths => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the Amazon S3 paths to read from.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> QuoteChar => Str

Specifies the character to use for quoting. The default is a double
quote: C<'"'>. Set this to C<-1> to turn off quoting entirely.


=head2 Recurse => Bool

If set to true, recursively reads files in all subdirectories under the
specified paths.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Separator => Str

Specifies the delimiter character. The default is a comma: ",", but any
other character can be specified.


=head2 SkipFirst => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether to skip the first data line. The
default value is C<False>.


=head2 WithHeader => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether to treat the first line as a
header. The default value is C<False>.


=head2 WriteHeader => Bool

A Boolean value that specifies whether to write the header to output.
The default value is C<True>.
