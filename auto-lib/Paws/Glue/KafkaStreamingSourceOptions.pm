=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::KafkaStreamingSourceOptions

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::KafkaStreamingSourceOptions object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AddRecordTimestamp => $value, ..., TopicName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::KafkaStreamingSourceOptions object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AddRecordTimestamp

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Additional options for streaming.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AddRecordTimestamp => Str

When this option is set to 'true', the data output will contain an
additional column named "__src_timestamp" that indicates the time when
the corresponding record received by the topic. The default value is
'false'. This option is supported in Glue version 4.0 or later.


=head2 Assign => Str

The specific C<TopicPartitions> to consume. You must specify at least
one of C<"topicName">, C<"assign"> or C<"subscribePattern">.


=head2 BootstrapServers => Str

A list of bootstrap server URLs, for example, as
C<b-1.vpc-test-2.o4q88o.c6.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9094>. This
option must be specified in the API call or defined in the table
metadata in the Data Catalog.


=head2 Classification => Str

An optional classification.


=head2 ConnectionName => Str

The name of the connection.


=head2 Delimiter => Str

Specifies the delimiter character.


=head2 EmitConsumerLagMetrics => Str

When this option is set to 'true', for each batch, it will emit the
metrics for the duration between the oldest record received by the
topic and the time it arrives in Glue to CloudWatch. The metric's name
is "glue.driver.streaming.maxConsumerLagInMs". The default value is
'false'. This option is supported in Glue version 4.0 or later.


=head2 EndingOffsets => Str

The end point when a batch query is ended. Possible values are either
C<"latest"> or a JSON string that specifies an ending offset for each
C<TopicPartition>.


=head2 IncludeHeaders => Bool

Whether to include the Kafka headers. When the option is set to "true",
the data output will contain an additional column named
"glue_streaming_kafka_headers" with type C<Array[Struct(key: String,
value: String)]>. The default value is "false". This option is
available in Glue version 3.0 or later only.


=head2 MaxOffsetsPerTrigger => Int

The rate limit on the maximum number of offsets that are processed per
trigger interval. The specified total number of offsets is
proportionally split across C<topicPartitions> of different volumes.
The default value is null, which means that the consumer reads all
offsets until the known latest offset.


=head2 MinPartitions => Int

The desired minimum number of partitions to read from Kafka. The
default value is null, which means that the number of spark partitions
is equal to the number of Kafka partitions.


=head2 NumRetries => Int

The number of times to retry before failing to fetch Kafka offsets. The
default value is C<3>.


=head2 PollTimeoutMs => Int

The timeout in milliseconds to poll data from Kafka in Spark job
executors. The default value is C<512>.


=head2 RetryIntervalMs => Int

The time in milliseconds to wait before retrying to fetch Kafka
offsets. The default value is C<10>.


=head2 SecurityProtocol => Str

The protocol used to communicate with brokers. The possible values are
C<"SSL"> or C<"PLAINTEXT">.


=head2 StartingOffsets => Str

The starting position in the Kafka topic to read data from. The
possible values are C<"earliest"> or C<"latest">. The default value is
C<"latest">.


=head2 StartingTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of the record in the Kafka topic to start reading data
from. The possible values are a timestamp string in UTC format of the
pattern C<yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SSZ> (where Z represents a UTC timezone
offset with a +/-. For example: "2023-04-04T08:00:00+08:00").

Only one of C<StartingTimestamp> or C<StartingOffsets> must be set.


=head2 SubscribePattern => Str

A Java regex string that identifies the topic list to subscribe to. You
must specify at least one of C<"topicName">, C<"assign"> or
C<"subscribePattern">.


=head2 TopicName => Str

The topic name as specified in Apache Kafka. You must specify at least
one of C<"topicName">, C<"assign"> or C<"subscribePattern">.
