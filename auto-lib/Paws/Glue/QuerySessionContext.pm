=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::QuerySessionContext

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::QuerySessionContext object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalContext => $value, ..., QueryStartTime => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::QuerySessionContext object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalContext

=head1 DESCRIPTION

or Glue. Contains both a Lake Formation generated authorization
identifier and information from the request's authorization context.

An opaque string-string map passed by the query engine.


=head2 ClusterId => Str

An identifier string for the consumer cluster.


=head2 QueryAuthorizationId => Str

A cryptographically generated query identifier generated by Glue or
Lake Formation.


=head2 QueryId => Str

A unique identifier generated by the query engine for the query.


=head2 QueryStartTime => Str

A timestamp provided by the query engine for when the query started.
