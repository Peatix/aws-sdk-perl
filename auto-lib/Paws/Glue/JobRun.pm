=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::JobRun

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::JobRun object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllocatedCapacity => $value, ..., WorkerType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::JobRun object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllocatedCapacity

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains information about a job run.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllocatedCapacity => Int

This field is deprecated. Use C<MaxCapacity> instead.

The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) allocated to this
JobRun. From 2 to 100 DPUs can be allocated; the default is 10. A DPU
is a relative measure of processing power that consists of 4 vCPUs of
compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For more information, see the
Glue pricing page (https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/).


=head2 Arguments => L<Paws::Glue::GenericMap>

The job arguments associated with this run. For this job run, they
replace the default arguments set in the job definition itself.

You can specify arguments here that your own job-execution script
consumes, as well as arguments that Glue itself consumes.

Job arguments may be logged. Do not pass plaintext secrets as
arguments. Retrieve secrets from a Glue Connection, Secrets Manager or
other secret management mechanism if you intend to keep them within the
Job.

For information about how to specify and consume your own Job
arguments, see the Calling Glue APIs in Python
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-python-calling.html)
topic in the developer guide.

For information about the arguments you can provide to this field when
configuring Spark jobs, see the Special Parameters Used by Glue
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/aws-glue-programming-etl-glue-arguments.html)
topic in the developer guide.

For information about the arguments you can provide to this field when
configuring Ray jobs, see Using job parameters in Ray jobs
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/author-job-ray-job-parameters.html)
in the developer guide.


=head2 Attempt => Int

The number of the attempt to run this job.


=head2 CompletedOn => Str

The date and time that this job run completed.


=head2 DPUSeconds => Num

This field can be set for either job runs with execution class C<FLEX>
or when Auto Scaling is enabled, and represents the total time each
executor ran during the lifecycle of a job run in seconds, multiplied
by a DPU factor (1 for C<G.1X>, 2 for C<G.2X>, or 0.25 for C<G.025X>
workers). This value may be different than the
C<executionEngineRuntime> * C<MaxCapacity> as in the case of Auto
Scaling jobs, as the number of executors running at a given time may be
less than the C<MaxCapacity>. Therefore, it is possible that the value
of C<DPUSeconds> is less than C<executionEngineRuntime> *
C<MaxCapacity>.


=head2 ErrorMessage => Str

An error message associated with this job run.


=head2 ExecutionClass => Str

Indicates whether the job is run with a standard or flexible execution
class. The standard execution-class is ideal for time-sensitive
workloads that require fast job startup and dedicated resources.

The flexible execution class is appropriate for time-insensitive jobs
whose start and completion times may vary.

Only jobs with Glue version 3.0 and above and command type C<glueetl>
will be allowed to set C<ExecutionClass> to C<FLEX>. The flexible
execution class is available for Spark jobs.


=head2 ExecutionTime => Int

The amount of time (in seconds) that the job run consumed resources.


=head2 GlueVersion => Str

In Spark jobs, C<GlueVersion> determines the versions of Apache Spark
and Python that Glue available in a job. The Python version indicates
the version supported for jobs of type Spark.

Ray jobs should set C<GlueVersion> to C<4.0> or greater. However, the
versions of Ray, Python and additional libraries available in your Ray
job are determined by the C<Runtime> parameter of the Job command.

For more information about the available Glue versions and
corresponding Spark and Python versions, see Glue version
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/add-job.html) in the
developer guide.

Jobs that are created without specifying a Glue version default to Glue
0.9.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID of this job run.


=head2 JobMode => Str

A mode that describes how a job was created. Valid values are:

=over

=item *

C<SCRIPT> - The job was created using the Glue Studio script editor.

=item *

C<VISUAL> - The job was created using the Glue Studio visual editor.

=item *

C<NOTEBOOK> - The job was created using an interactive sessions
notebook.

=back

When the C<JobMode> field is missing or null, C<SCRIPT> is assigned as
the default value.


=head2 JobName => Str

The name of the job definition being used in this run.


=head2 JobRunQueuingEnabled => Bool

Specifies whether job run queuing is enabled for the job run.

A value of true means job run queuing is enabled for the job run. If
false or not populated, the job run will not be considered for
queueing.


=head2 JobRunState => Str

The current state of the job run. For more information about the
statuses of jobs that have terminated abnormally, see Glue Job Run
Statuses
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/job-run-statuses.html).


=head2 LastModifiedOn => Str

The last time that this job run was modified.


=head2 LogGroupName => Str

The name of the log group for secure logging that can be server-side
encrypted in Amazon CloudWatch using KMS. This name can be
C</aws-glue/jobs/>, in which case the default encryption is C<NONE>. If
you add a role name and C<SecurityConfiguration> name (in other words,
C</aws-glue/jobs-yourRoleName-yourSecurityConfigurationName/>), then
that security configuration is used to encrypt the log group.


=head2 MaintenanceWindow => Str

This field specifies a day of the week and hour for a maintenance
window for streaming jobs. Glue periodically performs maintenance
activities. During these maintenance windows, Glue will need to restart
your streaming jobs.

Glue will restart the job within 3 hours of the specified maintenance
window. For instance, if you set up the maintenance window for Monday
at 10:00AM GMT, your jobs will be restarted between 10:00AM GMT to
1:00PM GMT.


=head2 MaxCapacity => Num

For Glue version 1.0 or earlier jobs, using the standard worker type,
the number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated
when this job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power
that consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB of memory. For
more information, see the Glue pricing page
(https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/).

For Glue version 2.0+ jobs, you cannot specify a C<Maximum capacity>.
Instead, you should specify a C<Worker type> and the C<Number of
workers>.

Do not set C<MaxCapacity> if using C<WorkerType> and
C<NumberOfWorkers>.

The value that can be allocated for C<MaxCapacity> depends on whether
you are running a Python shell job, an Apache Spark ETL job, or an
Apache Spark streaming ETL job:

=over

=item *

When you specify a Python shell job (C<JobCommand.Name>="pythonshell"),
you can allocate either 0.0625 or 1 DPU. The default is 0.0625 DPU.

=item *

When you specify an Apache Spark ETL job (C<JobCommand.Name>="glueetl")
or Apache Spark streaming ETL job (C<JobCommand.Name>="gluestreaming"),
you can allocate from 2 to 100 DPUs. The default is 10 DPUs. This job
type cannot have a fractional DPU allocation.

=back



=head2 NotificationProperty => L<Paws::Glue::NotificationProperty>

Specifies configuration properties of a job run notification.


=head2 NumberOfWorkers => Int

The number of workers of a defined C<workerType> that are allocated
when a job runs.


=head2 PredecessorRuns => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::Predecessor>]

A list of predecessors to this job run.


=head2 PreviousRunId => Str

The ID of the previous run of this job. For example, the C<JobRunId>
specified in the C<StartJobRun> action.


=head2 ProfileName => Str

The name of an Glue usage profile associated with the job run.


=head2 SecurityConfiguration => Str

The name of the C<SecurityConfiguration> structure to be used with this
job run.


=head2 StartedOn => Str

The date and time at which this job run was started.


=head2 StateDetail => Str

This field holds details that pertain to the state of a job run. The
field is nullable.

For example, when a job run is in a WAITING state as a result of job
run queuing, the field has the reason why the job run is in that state.


=head2 Timeout => Int

The C<JobRun> timeout in minutes. This is the maximum time that a job
run can consume resources before it is terminated and enters C<TIMEOUT>
status. This value overrides the timeout value set in the parent job.

Jobs must have timeout values less than 7 days or 10080 minutes.
Otherwise, the jobs will throw an exception.

When the value is left blank, the timeout is defaulted to 2880 minutes.

Any existing Glue jobs that had a timeout value greater than 7 days
will be defaulted to 7 days. For instance if you have specified a
timeout of 20 days for a batch job, it will be stopped on the 7th day.

For streaming jobs, if you have set up a maintenance window, it will be
restarted during the maintenance window after 7 days.


=head2 TriggerName => Str

The name of the trigger that started this job run.


=head2 WorkerType => Str

The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a job runs.
Accepts a value of G.1X, G.2X, G.4X, G.8X or G.025X for Spark jobs.
Accepts the value Z.2X for Ray jobs.

=over

=item *

For the C<G.1X> worker type, each worker maps to 1 DPU (4 vCPUs, 16 GB
of memory) with 94GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We
recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms,
joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run
most jobs.

=item *

For the C<G.2X> worker type, each worker maps to 2 DPU (8 vCPUs, 32 GB
of memory) with 138GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We
recommend this worker type for workloads such as data transforms,
joins, and queries, to offers a scalable and cost effective way to run
most jobs.

=item *

For the C<G.4X> worker type, each worker maps to 4 DPU (16 vCPUs, 64 GB
of memory) with 256GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We
recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most
demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker
type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs in
the following Amazon Web Services Regions: US East (Ohio), US East (N.
Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific
(Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Canada (Central), Europe (Frankfurt),
Europe (Ireland), and Europe (Stockholm).

=item *

For the C<G.8X> worker type, each worker maps to 8 DPU (32 vCPUs, 128
GB of memory) with 512GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We
recommend this worker type for jobs whose workloads contain your most
demanding transforms, aggregations, joins, and queries. This worker
type is available only for Glue version 3.0 or later Spark ETL jobs, in
the same Amazon Web Services Regions as supported for the C<G.4X>
worker type.

=item *

For the C<G.025X> worker type, each worker maps to 0.25 DPU (2 vCPUs, 4
GB of memory) with 84GB disk, and provides 1 executor per worker. We
recommend this worker type for low volume streaming jobs. This worker
type is only available for Glue version 3.0 or later streaming jobs.

=item *

For the C<Z.2X> worker type, each worker maps to 2 M-DPU (8vCPUs, 64 GB
of memory) with 128 GB disk, and provides up to 8 Ray workers based on
the autoscaler.
