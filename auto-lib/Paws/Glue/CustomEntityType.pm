Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::CustomEntityType object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ContextWords => $value, ..., RegexString => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::CustomEntityType object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ContextWords

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object representing a custom pattern for detecting sensitive data
across the columns and rows of your structured data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ContextWords => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]
