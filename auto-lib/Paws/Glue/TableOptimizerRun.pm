=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerRun

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerRun object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CompactionMetrics => $value, ..., StartTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerRun object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CompactionMetrics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains details for a table optimizer run.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CompactionMetrics => L<Paws::Glue::CompactionMetrics>

A C<CompactionMetrics> object containing metrics for the optimizer run.


=head2 EndTimestamp => Str

Represents the epoch timestamp at which the compaction job ended.


=head2 Error => Str

An error that occured during the optimizer run.


=head2 EventType => Str

An event type representing the status of the table optimizer run.


=head2 Metrics => L<Paws::Glue::RunMetrics>

A C<RunMetrics> object containing metrics for the optimizer run.

This member is deprecated. See the individual metric members for
compaction, retention, and orphan file deletion.


=head2 OrphanFileDeletionMetrics => L<Paws::Glue::OrphanFileDeletionMetrics>

An C<OrphanFileDeletionMetrics> object containing metrics for the
optimizer run.


=head2 RetentionMetrics => L<Paws::Glue::RetentionMetrics>

A C<RetentionMetrics> object containing metrics for the optimizer run.


=head2 StartTimestamp => Str

Represents the epoch timestamp at which the compaction job was started
within Lake Formation.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Glue>
