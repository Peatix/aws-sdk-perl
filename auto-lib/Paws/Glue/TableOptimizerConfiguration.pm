=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerConfiguration

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerConfiguration object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Enabled => $value, ..., VpcConfiguration => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerConfiguration object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Enabled

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains details on the configuration of a table optimizer. You pass
this configuration when creating or updating a table optimizer.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Enabled => Bool

Whether table optimization is enabled.


=head2 OrphanFileDeletionConfiguration => L<Paws::Glue::OrphanFileDeletionConfiguration>

The configuration for an orphan file deletion optimizer.


=head2 RetentionConfiguration => L<Paws::Glue::RetentionConfiguration>

The configuration for a snapshot retention optimizer.


=head2 RoleArn => Str

A role passed by the caller which gives the service permission to
update the resources associated with the optimizer on the caller's
behalf.


=head2 VpcConfiguration => L<Paws::Glue::TableOptimizerVpcConfiguration>

A C<TableOptimizerVpcConfiguration> object representing the VPC
configuration for a table optimizer.

This configuration is necessary to perform optimization on tables that
are in a customer VPC.



=head1 SEE ALSO
