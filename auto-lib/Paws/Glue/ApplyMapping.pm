=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::ApplyMapping

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::ApplyMapping object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inputs => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::ApplyMapping object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inputs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a transform that maps data property keys in the data source
to data property keys in the data target. You can rename keys, modify
the data types for keys, and choose which keys to drop from the
dataset.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 B<REQUIRED> Mapping => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::Mapping>]

Specifies the mapping of data property keys in the data source to data
property keys in the data target.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the transform node.
