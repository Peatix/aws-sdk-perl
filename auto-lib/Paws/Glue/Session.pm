=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Session

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Session object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Command => $value, ..., WorkerType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Session object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Command

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The period in which a remote Spark runtime environment is running.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Command => L<Paws::Glue::SessionCommand>

The command object.See SessionCommand.


=head2 CompletedOn => Str

The date and time that this session is completed.


=head2 Connections => L<Paws::Glue::ConnectionsList>

The number of connections used for the session.


=head2 CreatedOn => Str

The time and date when the session was created.


=head2 DefaultArguments => L<Paws::Glue::OrchestrationArgumentsMap>

A map array of key-value pairs. Max is 75 pairs.


=head2 Description => Str

The description of the session.


=head2 DPUSeconds => Num

The DPUs consumed by the session (formula: ExecutionTime *
MaxCapacity).


=head2 ErrorMessage => Str

The error message displayed during the session.


=head2 ExecutionTime => Num

The total time the session ran for.


=head2 GlueVersion => Str

The Glue version determines the versions of Apache Spark and Python
that Glue supports. The GlueVersion must be greater than 2.0.


=head2 Id => Str

The ID of the session.


=head2 IdleTimeout => Int

The number of minutes when idle before the session times out.


=head2 MaxCapacity => Num

The number of Glue data processing units (DPUs) that can be allocated
when the job runs. A DPU is a relative measure of processing power that
consists of 4 vCPUs of compute capacity and 16 GB memory.


=head2 NumberOfWorkers => Int

The number of workers of a defined C<WorkerType> to use for the
session.


=head2 ProfileName => Str

The name of an Glue usage profile associated with the session.


=head2 Progress => Num

The code execution progress of the session.


=head2 Role => Str

The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with
the Session.


=head2 SecurityConfiguration => Str

The name of the SecurityConfiguration structure to be used with the
session.


=head2 Status => Str

The session status.


=head2 WorkerType => Str

The type of predefined worker that is allocated when a session runs.
Accepts a value of C<G.1X>, C<G.2X>, C<G.4X>, or C<G.8X> for Spark
sessions. Accepts the value C<Z.2X> for Ray sessions.
