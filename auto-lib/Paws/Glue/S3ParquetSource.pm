=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::S3ParquetSource

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::S3ParquetSource object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdditionalOptions => $value, ..., Recurse => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::S3ParquetSource object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdditionalOptions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies an Apache Parquet data store stored in Amazon S3.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdditionalOptions => L<Paws::Glue::S3DirectSourceAdditionalOptions>

Specifies additional connection options.


=head2 CompressionType => Str

Specifies how the data is compressed. This is generally not necessary
if the data has a standard file extension. Possible values are
C<"gzip"> and C<"bzip">).


=head2 Exclusions => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A string containing a JSON list of Unix-style glob patterns to exclude.
For example, "[\"**.pdf\"]" excludes all PDF files.


=head2 GroupFiles => Str

Grouping files is turned on by default when the input contains more
than 50,000 files. To turn on grouping with fewer than 50,000 files,
set this parameter to "inPartition". To disable grouping when there are
more than 50,000 files, set this parameter to C<"none">.


=head2 GroupSize => Str

The target group size in bytes. The default is computed based on the
input data size and the size of your cluster. When there are fewer than
50,000 input files, C<"groupFiles"> must be set to C<"inPartition"> for
this to take effect.


=head2 MaxBand => Int

This option controls the duration in milliseconds after which the s3
listing is likely to be consistent. Files with modification timestamps
falling within the last maxBand milliseconds are tracked specially when
using JobBookmarks to account for Amazon S3 eventual consistency. Most
users don't need to set this option. The default is 900000
milliseconds, or 15 minutes.


=head2 MaxFilesInBand => Int

This option specifies the maximum number of files to save from the last
maxBand seconds. If this number is exceeded, extra files are skipped
and only processed in the next job run.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the data store.


=head2 OutputSchemas => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::GlueSchema>]

Specifies the data schema for the S3 Parquet source.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Paths => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of the Amazon S3 paths to read from.


=head2 Recurse => Bool

If set to true, recursively reads files in all subdirectories under the
specified paths.
