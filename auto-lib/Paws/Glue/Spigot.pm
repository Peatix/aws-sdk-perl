=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Spigot

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Spigot object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inputs => $value, ..., Topk => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Spigot object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inputs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a transform that writes samples of the data to an Amazon S3
bucket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The data inputs identified by their node names.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the transform node.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Path => Str

A path in Amazon S3 where the transform will write a subset of records
from the dataset to a JSON file in an Amazon S3 bucket.


=head2 Prob => Num

The probability (a decimal value with a maximum value of 1) of picking
any given record. A value of 1 indicates that each row read from the
dataset should be included in the sample output.


=head2 Topk => Int

Specifies a number of records to write starting from the beginning of
the dataset.
