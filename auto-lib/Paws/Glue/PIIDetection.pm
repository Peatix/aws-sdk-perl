=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::PIIDetection

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::PIIDetection object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EntityTypesToDetect => $value, ..., ThresholdFraction => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::PIIDetection object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EntityTypesToDetect

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a transform that identifies, removes or masks PII data.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> EntityTypesToDetect => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

Indicates the types of entities the PIIDetection transform will
identify as PII data.

PII type entities include: PERSON_NAME, DATE, USA_SNN, EMAIL, USA_ITIN,
USA_PASSPORT_NUMBER, PHONE_NUMBER, BANK_ACCOUNT, IP_ADDRESS,
MAC_ADDRESS, USA_CPT_CODE, USA_HCPCS_CODE, USA_NATIONAL_DRUG_CODE,
USA_MEDICARE_BENEFICIARY_IDENTIFIER,
USA_HEALTH_INSURANCE_CLAIM_NUMBER,CREDIT_CARD,USA_NATIONAL_PROVIDER_IDENTIFIER,USA_DEA_NUMBER,USA_DRIVING_LICENSE


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The node ID inputs to the transform.


=head2 MaskValue => Str

Indicates the value that will replace the detected entity.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the transform node.


=head2 OutputColumnName => Str

Indicates the output column name that will contain any entity type
detected in that row.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PiiType => Str

Indicates the type of PIIDetection transform.


=head2 SampleFraction => Num

Indicates the fraction of the data to sample when scanning for PII
entities.


=head2 ThresholdFraction => Num

Indicates the fraction of the data that must be met in order for a
column to be identified as PII data.
