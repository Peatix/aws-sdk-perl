Paws::Glue::IntegrationConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::IntegrationConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RefreshInterval => $value, ..., RefreshInterval => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::IntegrationConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RefreshInterval

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Properties associated with the integration.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RefreshInterval => Str

Specifies the frequency at which CDC (Change Data Capture) pulls or
incremental loads should occur. This parameter provides flexibility to
align the refresh rate with your specific data update patterns, system
load considerations, and performance optimization goals. Time increment
can be set from 15 minutes to 8640 minutes (six days). Currently
supports creation of C<RefreshInterval> only.
