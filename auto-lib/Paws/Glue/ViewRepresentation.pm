=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::ViewRepresentation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::ViewRepresentation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Dialect => $value, ..., ViewOriginalText => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::ViewRepresentation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Dialect

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A structure that contains the dialect of the view, and the query that
defines the view.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Dialect => Str

The dialect of the query engine.


=head2 DialectVersion => Str

The version of the dialect of the query engine. For example, 3.0.0.


=head2 IsStale => Bool

Dialects marked as stale are no longer valid and must be updated before
they can be queried in their respective query engines.


=head2 ValidationConnection => Str

The name of the connection to be used to validate the specific
representation of the view.


=head2 ViewExpandedText => Str

The expanded SQL for the view. This SQL is used by engines while
processing a query on a view. Engines may perform operations during
view creation to transform C<ViewOriginalText> to C<ViewExpandedText>.
For example:

=over

=item *

Fully qualified identifiers: C<SELECT * from table1 -E<gt> SELECT *
from db1.table1>

=back



=head2 ViewOriginalText => Str

The C<SELECT> query provided by the customer during C<CREATE VIEW DDL>.
This SQL is not used during a query on a view (C<ViewExpandedText> is
used instead). C<ViewOriginalText> is used for cases like C<SHOW CREATE
VIEW> where users want to see the original DDL command that created the
view.
