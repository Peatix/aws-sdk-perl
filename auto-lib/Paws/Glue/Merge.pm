=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Merge

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Merge object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Inputs => $value, ..., Source => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Merge object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Inputs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies a transform that merges a C<DynamicFrame> with a staging
C<DynamicFrame> based on the specified primary keys to identify
records. Duplicate records (records with the same primary keys) are not
de-duplicated.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Inputs => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The data inputs identified by their node names.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the transform node.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PrimaryKeys => ArrayRef[ArrayRef[Str|Undef]]

The list of primary key fields to match records from the source and
staging dynamic frames.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Source => Str

The source C<DynamicFrame> that will be merged with a staging
C<DynamicFrame>.
