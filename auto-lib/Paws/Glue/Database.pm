=head1 NAME

Paws::Glue::Database

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::Database object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { CatalogId => $value, ..., TargetDatabase => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::Database object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->CatalogId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Database> object represents a logical grouping of tables that
might reside in a Hive metastore or an RDBMS.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 CatalogId => Str

The ID of the Data Catalog in which the database resides.


=head2 CreateTableDefaultPermissions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Glue::PrincipalPermissions>]

Creates a set of default permissions on the table for principals. Used
by Lake Formation. Not used in the normal course of Glue operations.


=head2 CreateTime => Str

The time at which the metadata database was created in the catalog.


=head2 Description => Str

A description of the database.


=head2 FederatedDatabase => L<Paws::Glue::FederatedDatabase>

A C<FederatedDatabase> structure that references an entity outside the
Glue Data Catalog.


=head2 LocationUri => Str

The location of the database (for example, an HDFS path).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Name => Str

The name of the database. For Hive compatibility, this is folded to
lowercase when it is stored.


=head2 Parameters => L<Paws::Glue::ParametersMap>

These key-value pairs define parameters and properties of the database.


=head2 TargetDatabase => L<Paws::Glue::DatabaseIdentifier>

A C<DatabaseIdentifier> structure that describes a target database for
resource linking.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Glue>
