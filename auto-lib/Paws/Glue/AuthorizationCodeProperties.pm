Paws::Glue::AuthorizationCodeProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Glue::AuthorizationCodeProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AuthorizationCode => $value, ..., RedirectUri => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Glue::AuthorizationCodeProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AuthorizationCode

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The set of properties required for the the OAuth2 C<AUTHORIZATION_CODE>
grant type workflow.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AuthorizationCode => Str

An authorization code to be used in the third leg of the
C<AUTHORIZATION_CODE> grant workflow. This is a single-use code which
becomes invalid once exchanged for an access token, thus it is
acceptable to have this value as a request parameter.


=head2 RedirectUri => Str

The redirect URI where the user gets redirected to by authorization
server when issuing an authorization code. The URI is subsequently used
when the authorization code is exchanged for an access token.
