=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedEventSelector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedEventSelector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { FieldSelectors => $value, ..., Name => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedEventSelector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->FieldSelectors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Advanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for
CloudTrail management, data, and network activity events. They help you
control costs by logging only those events that are important to you.
For more information about configuring advanced event selectors, see
the Logging data events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html),
Logging network activity events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html),
and Logging management events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
topics in the I<CloudTrail User Guide>.

You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a
trail.

For information about configurable advanced event selector fields, see
AdvancedEventSelector
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html)
in the I<CloudTrail API Reference>.
