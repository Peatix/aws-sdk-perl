=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::PutEventSelectors - Arguments for method PutEventSelectors on L<Paws::CloudTrail>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method PutEventSelectors on the
L<AWS CloudTrail|Paws::CloudTrail> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method PutEventSelectors.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to PutEventSelectors.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cloudtrail = Paws->service('CloudTrail');
    my $PutEventSelectorsResponse = $cloudtrail->PutEventSelectors(
      TrailName              => 'MyString',
      AdvancedEventSelectors => [
        {
          FieldSelectors => [
            {
              Field    => 'MySelectorField',    # min: 1, max: 1000
              EndsWith => [
                'MyOperatorValue', ...          # min: 1, max: 2048

    # Results:
    my $AdvancedEventSelectors =
      $PutEventSelectorsResponse->AdvancedEventSelectors;
    my $EventSelectors = $PutEventSelectorsResponse->EventSelectors;
    my $TrailARN       = $PutEventSelectorsResponse->TrailARN;

    # Returns a L<Paws::CloudTrail::PutEventSelectorsResponse> object.

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdvancedEventSelectors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedEventSelector>]

Specifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can use
advanced event selectors to log management events, data events for all
resource types, and network activity events.

You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced
event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and
selectors on a trail. You can use either C<AdvancedEventSelectors> or
C<EventSelectors>, but not both. If you apply C<AdvancedEventSelectors>
to a trail, any existing C<EventSelectors> are overwritten. For more
information about advanced event selectors, see Logging data events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
and Logging network activity events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-network-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
in the I<CloudTrail User Guide>.



=head2 EventSelectors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudTrail::EventSelector>]

Specifies the settings for your event selectors. You can use event
selectors to log management events and data events for the following
resource types:

=over

=item *

C<AWS::DynamoDB::Table>

=item *

C<AWS::Lambda::Function>

=item *

C<AWS::S3::Object>

=back

You can't use event selectors to log network activity events.

You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail. You can use
either C<EventSelectors> or C<AdvancedEventSelectors> in a
C<PutEventSelectors> request, but not both. If you apply
C<EventSelectors> to a trail, any existing C<AdvancedEventSelectors>
are overwritten.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> TrailName => Str

Specifies the name of the trail or trail ARN. If you specify a trail
name, the string must meet the following requirements:

=over

=item *

Contain only ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), periods (.),
underscores (_), or dashes (-)

=item *

Start with a letter or number, and end with a letter or number

=item *

Be between 3 and 128 characters

=item *

Have no adjacent periods, underscores or dashes. Names like
C<my-_namespace> and C<my--namespace> are not valid.

=item *

Not be in IP address format (for example, 192.168.5.4)

=back

If you specify a trail ARN, it must be in the following format.

C<arn:aws:cloudtrail:us-east-2:123456789012:trail/MyTrail>
