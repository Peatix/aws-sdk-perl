=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::EventSelector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrail::EventSelector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DataResources => $value, ..., ReadWriteType => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrail::EventSelector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DataResources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event
settings for your trail. By default, trails created without specific
event selectors will be configured to log all read and write management
events, and no data events. When an event occurs in your account,
CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all trails. For each trail,
if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs
the event. If the event doesn't match any event selector, the trail
doesn't log the event.

You can configure up to five event selectors for a trail.

You cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a
trail.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DataResources => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudTrail::DataResource>]

CloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects in
standard S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with
basic event selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for an
individual event selector, but the total number of data resources
cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit
does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events.

For more information, see Data Events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
and Limits in CloudTrail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html)
in the I<CloudTrail User Guide>.

To log data events for all other resource types including objects
stored in directory buckets
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/directory-buckets-overview.html),
you must use AdvancedEventSelectors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedEventSelector.html).
You must also use C<AdvancedEventSelectors> if you want to filter on
the C<eventName> field.


=head2 ExcludeManagementEventSources => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An optional list of service event sources from which you do not want
management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list
can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out Key Management
Service or Amazon RDS Data API events by containing
C<kms.amazonaws.com> or C<rdsdata.amazonaws.com>. By default,
C<ExcludeManagementEventSources> is empty, and KMS and Amazon RDS Data
API events are logged to your trail. You can exclude management event
sources only in Regions that support the event source.


=head2 IncludeManagementEvents => Bool

Specify if you want your event selector to include management events
for your trail.

For more information, see Management Events
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
in the I<CloudTrail User Guide>.

By default, the value is C<true>.

The first copy of management events is free. You are charged for
additional copies of management events that you are logging on any
subsequent trail in the same Region. For more information about
CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing
(http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/pricing/).


=head2 ReadWriteType => Str

Specify if you want your trail to log read-only events, write-only
events, or all. For example, the EC2 C<GetConsoleOutput> is a read-only
API operation and C<RunInstances> is a write-only API operation.

By default, the value is C<All>.
