=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::EventDataStore

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrail::EventDataStore object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AdvancedEventSelectors => $value, ..., UpdatedTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrail::EventDataStore object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AdvancedEventSelectors

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A storage lake of event data against which you can run complex
SQL-based queries. An event data store can include events that you have
logged on your account. To select events for an event data store, use
advanced event selectors
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-lake-concepts.html#adv-event-selectors).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AdvancedEventSelectors => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedEventSelector>]

The advanced event selectors that were used to select events for the
data store.


=head2 CreatedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp of the event data store's creation.


=head2 EventDataStoreArn => Str

The ARN of the event data store.


=head2 MultiRegionEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether the event data store includes events from all
Regions, or only from the Region in which it was created.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the event data store.


=head2 OrganizationEnabled => Bool

Indicates that an event data store is collecting logged events for an
organization.


=head2 RetentionPeriod => Int

The retention period, in days.


=head2 Status => Str

The status of an event data store.


=head2 TerminationProtectionEnabled => Bool

Indicates whether the event data store is protected from termination.


=head2 UpdatedTimestamp => Str

The timestamp showing when an event data store was updated, if
applicable. C<UpdatedTimestamp> is always either the same or newer than
the time shown in C<CreatedTimestamp>.
