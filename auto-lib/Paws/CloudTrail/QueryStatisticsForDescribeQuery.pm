=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::QueryStatisticsForDescribeQuery

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrail::QueryStatisticsForDescribeQuery object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { BytesScanned => $value, ..., ExecutionTimeInMillis => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrail::QueryStatisticsForDescribeQuery object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->BytesScanned

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gets metadata about a query, including the number of events that were
matched, the total number of events scanned, the query run time in
milliseconds, and the query's creation time.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 BytesScanned => Int

The total bytes that the query scanned in the event data store. This
value matches the number of bytes for which your account is billed for
the query, unless the query is still running.


=head2 CreationTime => Str

The creation time of the query.


=head2 EventsMatched => Int

The number of events that matched a query.


=head2 EventsScanned => Int

The number of events that the query scanned in the event data store.


=head2 ExecutionTimeInMillis => Int

The query's run time, in milliseconds.
