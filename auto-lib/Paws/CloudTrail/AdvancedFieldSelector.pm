=head1 NAME

Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedFieldSelector

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedFieldSelector object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { EndsWith => $value, ..., StartsWith => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CloudTrail::AdvancedFieldSelector object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->EndsWith

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A single selector statement in an advanced event selector.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 EndsWith => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that includes events that match the last few characters of
the event record field specified as the value of C<Field>.


=head2 Equals => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that includes events that match the exact value of the
event record field specified as the value of C<Field>. This is the only
valid operator that you can use with the C<readOnly>, C<eventCategory>,
and C<resources.type> fields.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Field => Str

A field in a CloudTrail event record on which to filter events to be
logged. For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config
configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of
Amazon Web Services, the field is used only for selecting events as
filtering is not supported.

For more information, see AdvancedFieldSelector
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_AdvancedFieldSelector.html)
in the I<CloudTrail API Reference>.

Selectors don't support the use of wildcards like C<*> . To match
multiple values with a single condition, you may use C<StartsWith>,
C<EndsWith>, C<NotStartsWith>, or C<NotEndsWith> to explicitly match
the beginning or end of the event field.


=head2 NotEndsWith => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of
the event record field specified as the value of C<Field>.


=head2 NotEquals => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the
event record field specified as the value of C<Field>.


=head2 NotStartsWith => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of
the event record field specified as the value of C<Field>.


=head2 StartsWith => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

An operator that includes events that match the first few characters of
the event record field specified as the value of C<Field>.
