=head1 NAME

Paws::DSQL::MultiRegionProperties

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::DSQL::MultiRegionProperties object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Clusters => $value, ..., WitnessRegion => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::DSQL::MultiRegionProperties object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Clusters

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Defines the structure for multi-Region cluster configurations,
containing the witness region and linked cluster settings.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Clusters => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The set of linked clusters that form the multi-Region cluster
configuration. Each linked cluster represents a database instance in a
different Region.


=head2 WitnessRegion => Str

The that serves as the witness region for a multi-Region cluster. The
witness region helps maintain cluster consistency and quorum.
