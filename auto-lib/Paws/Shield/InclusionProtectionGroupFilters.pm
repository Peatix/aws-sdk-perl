=head1 NAME

Paws::Shield::InclusionProtectionGroupFilters

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Shield::InclusionProtectionGroupFilters object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Aggregations => $value, ..., ResourceTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Shield::InclusionProtectionGroupFilters object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Aggregations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Narrows the set of protection groups that the call retrieves. You can
retrieve a single protection group by its name and you can retrieve all
protection groups that are configured with a specific pattern,
aggregation, or resource type. You can provide up to one criteria per
filter type. Shield Advanced returns the protection groups that exactly
match all of the search criteria that you provide.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Aggregations => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The aggregation setting of the protection groups that you want to
retrieve.


=head2 Patterns => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The pattern specification of the protection groups that you want to
retrieve.


=head2 ProtectionGroupIds => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The ID of the protection group that you want to retrieve.


=head2 ResourceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The resource type configuration of the protection groups that you want
to retrieve. In the protection group configuration, you specify the
resource type when you set the group's C<Pattern> to
C<BY_RESOURCE_TYPE>.
