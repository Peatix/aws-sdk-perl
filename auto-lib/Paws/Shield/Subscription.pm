=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Shield::Subscription object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AutoRenew => $value, ..., TimeCommitmentInSeconds => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Shield::Subscription object:

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AutoRenew => Str

If C<ENABLED>, the subscription will be automatically renewed at the
end of the existing subscription period.

When you initally create a subscription, C<AutoRenew> is set to
C<ENABLED>. You can change this by submitting an C<UpdateSubscription>
request. If the C<UpdateSubscription> request does not included a value
for C<AutoRenew>, the existing value for C<AutoRenew> remains
unchanged.


=head2 EndTime => Str

The date and time your subscription will end.


=head2 Limits => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Shield::Limit>]

Specifies how many protections of a given type you can create.


=head2 ProactiveEngagementStatus => Str

If C<ENABLED>, the Shield Response Team (SRT) will use email and phone
to notify contacts about escalations to the SRT and to initiate
proactive customer support.

If C<PENDING>, you have requested proactive engagement and the request
is pending. The status changes to C<ENABLED> when your request is fully
processed.

If C<DISABLED>, the SRT will not proactively notify contacts about
escalations or to initiate proactive customer support.


=head2 StartTime => Str

The start time of the subscription, in Unix time in seconds.


=head2 SubscriptionArn => Str

The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the subscription.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> SubscriptionLimits => L<Paws::Shield::SubscriptionLimits>
