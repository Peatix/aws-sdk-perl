=head1 NAME

Paws::Kinesis::ShardFilter

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Kinesis::ShardFilter object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ShardId => $value, ..., Type => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Kinesis::ShardFilter object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ShardId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The request parameter used to filter out the response of the
C<ListShards> API.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ShardId => Str

The exclusive start C<shardID> speified in the C<ShardFilter>
parameter. This property can only be used if the C<AFTER_SHARD_ID>
shard type is specified.


=head2 Timestamp => Str

The timestamps specified in the C<ShardFilter> parameter. A timestamp
is a Unix epoch date with precision in milliseconds. For example,
2016-04-04T19:58:46.480-00:00 or 1459799926.480. This property can only
be used if C<FROM_TIMESTAMP> or C<AT_TIMESTAMP> shard types are
specified.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Type => Str

The shard type specified in the C<ShardFilter> parameter. This is a
required property of the C<ShardFilter> parameter.

You can specify the following valid values:

=over

=item *

C<AFTER_SHARD_ID> - the response includes all the shards, starting with
the shard whose ID immediately follows the C<ShardId> that you
provided.

=item *

C<AT_TRIM_HORIZON> - the response includes all the shards that were
open at C<TRIM_HORIZON>.

=item *

C<FROM_TRIM_HORIZON> - (default), the response includes all the shards
within the retention period of the data stream (trim to tip).

=item *

C<AT_LATEST> - the response includes only the currently open shards of
the data stream.

=item *

C<AT_TIMESTAMP> - the response includes all shards whose start
timestamp is less than or equal to the given timestamp and end
timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp or still
open.

=item *

C<FROM_TIMESTAMP> - the response incldues all closed shards whose end
timestamp is greater than or equal to the given timestamp and also all
open shards. Corrected to C<TRIM_HORIZON> of the data stream if
C<FROM_TIMESTAMP> is less than the C<TRIM_HORIZON> value.
