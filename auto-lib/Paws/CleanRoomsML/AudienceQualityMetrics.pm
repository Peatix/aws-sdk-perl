=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRoomsML::AudienceQualityMetrics

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRoomsML::AudienceQualityMetrics object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RecallMetric => $value, ..., RelevanceMetrics => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRoomsML::AudienceQualityMetrics object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RecallMetric

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Metrics that describe the quality of the generated audience.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 RecallMetric => Num

The recall score of the generated audience. Recall is the percentage of
the most similar users (by default, the most similar 20%) from a sample
of the training data that are included in the seed audience by the
audience generation job. Values range from 0-1, larger values indicate
a better audience. A recall value approximately equal to the maximum
bin size indicates that the audience model is equivalent to random
selection.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RelevanceMetrics => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CleanRoomsML::RelevanceMetric>]

The relevance scores of the generated audience.
