=head1 NAME

Paws::CleanRoomsML::ContainerConfig

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::CleanRoomsML::ContainerConfig object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arguments => $value, ..., MetricDefinitions => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::CleanRoomsML::ContainerConfig object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arguments

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides configuration information for the dockerized container where
the model algorithm is stored.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arguments => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The arguments for a container used to run a training job. See How
Amazon SageMaker Runs Your Training Image for additional information.
For more information, see How Sagemaker runs your training image
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo-dockerfile.html).


=head2 Entrypoint => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The entrypoint script for a Docker container used to run a training
job. This script takes precedence over the default train processing
instructions. See How Amazon SageMaker Runs Your Training Image for
additional information. For more information, see How Sagemaker runs
your training image
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/your-algorithms-training-algo-dockerfile.html).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ImageUri => Str

The registry path of the docker image that contains the algorithm.
Clean Rooms ML supports both C<registry/repository[:tag]> and
C<registry/repositry[@digest]> image path formats. For more information
about using images in Clean Rooms ML, see the Sagemaker API reference
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AlgorithmSpecification.html#sagemaker-Type-AlgorithmSpecification-TrainingImage).


=head2 MetricDefinitions => ArrayRef[L<Paws::CleanRoomsML::MetricDefinition>]

A list of metric definition objects. Each object specifies the metric
name and regular expressions used to parse algorithm logs. Amazon Web
Services Clean Rooms ML publishes each metric to all members' Amazon
CloudWatch using IAM role configured in PutMLConfiguration.
