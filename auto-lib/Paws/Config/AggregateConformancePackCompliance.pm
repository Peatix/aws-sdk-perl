=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::AggregateConformancePackCompliance

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::AggregateConformancePackCompliance object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ComplianceType => $value, ..., TotalRuleCount => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::AggregateConformancePackCompliance object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ComplianceType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the number of compliant and noncompliant rules within a
conformance pack. Also provides the compliance status of the
conformance pack and the total rule count which includes compliant
rules, noncompliant rules, and rules that cannot be evaluated due to
insufficient data.

A conformance pack is compliant if all of the rules in a conformance
packs are compliant. It is noncompliant if any of the rules are not
compliant. The compliance status of a conformance pack is
INSUFFICIENT_DATA only if all rules within a conformance pack cannot be
evaluated due to insufficient data. If some of the rules in a
conformance pack are compliant but the compliance status of other rules
in that same conformance pack is INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the conformance
pack shows compliant.
