=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMetadata

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMetadata object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { DebugLogDeliveryAccounts => $value, ..., TagValueScope => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::OrganizationCustomPolicyRuleMetadata object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->DebugLogDeliveryAccounts

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An object that specifies metadata for your organization's Config Custom
Policy rule. The metadata includes the runtime system in use, which
accounts have debug logging enabled, and other custom rule metadata,
such as resource type, resource ID of Amazon Web Services resource, and
organization trigger types that initiate Config to evaluate Amazon Web
Services resources against a rule.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 DebugLogDeliveryAccounts => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of accounts that you can enable debug logging for your
organization Config Custom Policy rule. List is null when debug logging
is enabled for all accounts.


=head2 Description => Str

The description that you provide for your organization Config Custom
Policy rule.


=head2 InputParameters => Str

A string, in JSON format, that is passed to your organization Config
Custom Policy rule.


=head2 MaximumExecutionFrequency => Str

The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a rule.
Your Config Custom Policy rule is triggered when Config delivers the
configuration snapshot. For more information, see
ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties.


=head2 OrganizationConfigRuleTriggerTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The type of notification that initiates Config to run an evaluation for
a rule. For Config Custom Policy rules, Config supports
change-initiated notification types:

=over

=item *

C<ConfigurationItemChangeNotification> - Initiates an evaluation when
Config delivers a configuration item as a result of a resource change.

=item *

C<OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification> - Initiates an
evaluation when Config delivers an oversized configuration item. Config
may generate this notification type when a resource changes and the
notification exceeds the maximum size allowed by Amazon SNS.

=back



=head2 B<REQUIRED> PolicyRuntime => Str

The runtime system for your organization Config Custom Policy rules.
Guard is a policy-as-code language that allows you to write policies
that are enforced by Config Custom Policy rules. For more information
about Guard, see the Guard GitHub Repository
(https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard).


=head2 B<REQUIRED> PolicyText => Str

The policy definition containing the logic for your organization Config
Custom Policy rule.


=head2 ResourceIdScope => Str

The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.


=head2 ResourceTypesScope => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.


=head2 TagKeyScope => Str

One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a general
label that acts like a category for more specific tag values.


=head2 TagValueScope => Str

The optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A value acts
as a descriptor within a tag category (key).
