=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::RecordingMode

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::RecordingMode object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { RecordingFrequency => $value, ..., RecordingModeOverrides => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::RecordingMode object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->RecordingFrequency

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the default recording frequency that Config uses to record
configuration changes. Config supports I<Continuous recording> and
I<Daily recording>.

=over

=item *

Continuous recording allows you to record configuration changes
continuously whenever a change occurs.

=item *

Daily recording allows you to receive a configuration item (CI)
representing the most recent state of your resources over the last
24-hour period, only if itE<rsquo>s different from the previous CI
recorded.

=back

Firewall Manager depends on continuous recording to monitor your
resources. If you are using Firewall Manager, it is recommended that
you set the recording frequency to Continuous.

You can also override the recording frequency for specific resource
types.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> RecordingFrequency => Str

The default recording frequency that Config uses to record
configuration changes.

Daily recording cannot be specified for the following resource types:

=over

=item *

C<AWS::Config::ResourceCompliance>

=item *

C<AWS::Config::ConformancePackCompliance>

=item *

C<AWS::Config::ConfigurationRecorder>

=back

For the B<allSupported> (C<ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES>) recording
strategy, these resource types will be set to Continuous recording.


=head2 RecordingModeOverrides => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Config::RecordingModeOverride>]

An array of C<recordingModeOverride> objects for you to specify your
overrides for the recording mode. The C<recordingModeOverride> object
in the C<recordingModeOverrides> array consists of three fields: a
C<description>, the new C<recordingFrequency>, and an array of
C<resourceTypes> to override.



=head1 SEE ALSO

This class forms part of L<Paws>, describing an object used in L<Paws::Config>
