=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::ConfigurationItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::ConfigurationItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::ConfigurationItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A list that contains detailed configurations of a specified resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the
resource.


=head2 Arn => Str

Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the resource.


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone associated with the resource.


=head2 AwsRegion => Str

The region where the resource resides.


=head2 Configuration => Str

The description of the resource configuration.


=head2 ConfigurationItemCaptureTime => Str

The time when the recording of configuration changes was initiated for
the resource.


=head2 ConfigurationItemDeliveryTime => Str

The time when configuration changes for the resource were delivered.

This field is optional and is not guaranteed to be present in a
configuration item (CI). If you are using daily recording, this field
will be populated. However, if you are using continuous recording, this
field will be omitted since the delivery time is instantaneous as the
CI is available right away. For more information on daily recording and
continuous recording, see Recording Frequency
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-recording-frequency)
in the I<Config Developer Guide>.


=head2 ConfigurationItemMD5Hash => Str

Unique MD5 hash that represents the configuration item's state.

You can use MD5 hash to compare the states of two or more configuration
items that are associated with the same resource.


=head2 ConfigurationItemStatus => Str

The configuration item status. Valid values include:

=over

=item *

OK E<ndash> The resource configuration has been updated

=item *

ResourceDiscovered E<ndash> The resource was newly discovered

=item *

ResourceNotRecorded E<ndash> The resource was discovered but its
configuration was not recorded since the recorder doesn't record
resources of this type

=item *

ResourceDeleted E<ndash> The resource was deleted

=item *

ResourceDeletedNotRecorded E<ndash> The resource was deleted but its
configuration was not recorded since the recorder doesn't record
resources of this type

=back



=head2 ConfigurationStateId => Str

An identifier that indicates the ordering of the configuration items of
a resource.


=head2 RecordingFrequency => Str

The recording frequency that Config uses to record configuration
changes for the resource.


=head2 RelatedEvents => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A list of CloudTrail event IDs.

A populated field indicates that the current configuration was
initiated by the events recorded in the CloudTrail log. For more
information about CloudTrail, see What Is CloudTrail
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/what_is_cloud_trail_top_level.html).

An empty field indicates that the current configuration was not
initiated by any event. As of Version 1.3, the relatedEvents field is
empty. You can access the LookupEvents API
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_LookupEvents.html)
in the I<CloudTrail API Reference> to retrieve the events for the
resource.


=head2 Relationships => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Config::Relationship>]

A list of related Amazon Web Services resources.


=head2 ResourceCreationTime => Str

The time stamp when the resource was created.


=head2 ResourceId => Str

The ID of the resource (for example, C<sg-xxxxxx>).


=head2 ResourceName => Str

The custom name of the resource, if available.


=head2 ResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource.


=head2 SupplementaryConfiguration => L<Paws::Config::SupplementaryConfiguration>

Configuration attributes that Config returns for certain resource types
to supplement the information returned for the C<configuration>
parameter.


=head2 Tags => L<Paws::Config::Tags>

A mapping of key value tags associated with the resource.


=head2 Version => Str

The version number of the resource configuration.
