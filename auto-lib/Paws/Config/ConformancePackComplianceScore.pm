A compliance score is the percentage of the number of compliant
rule-resource combinations in a conformance pack compared to the number
of total possible rule-resource combinations in the conformance pack.
This metric provides you with a high-level view of the compliance state
of your conformance packs. You can use it to identify, investigate, and
understand the level of compliance in your conformance packs.
