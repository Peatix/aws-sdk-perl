=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::BaseConfigurationItem

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::BaseConfigurationItem object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., Version => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::BaseConfigurationItem object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The detailed configurations of a specified resource.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AccountId => Str

The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID associated with the
resource.


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource.


=head2 AvailabilityZone => Str

The Availability Zone associated with the resource.


=head2 AwsRegion => Str

The region where the resource resides.


=head2 Configuration => Str

The description of the resource configuration.


=head2 ConfigurationItemCaptureTime => Str

The time when the recording of configuration changes was initiated for
the resource.


=head2 ConfigurationItemDeliveryTime => Str

This field is optional and is not guaranteed to be present in a
configuration item (CI). If you are using daily recording, this field
will be populated. However, if you are using continuous recording, this
field will be omitted since the delivery time is instantaneous as the
CI is available right away. For more information on daily recording and
continuous recording, see Recording Frequency
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-recording-frequency)
in the I<Config Developer Guide>.


=head2 ConfigurationItemStatus => Str

The configuration item status. Valid values include:

=item *

OK E<ndash> The resource configuration has been updated.

=item *

ResourceDiscovered E<ndash> The resource was newly discovered.

=item *

ResourceNotRecorded E<ndash> The resource was discovered, but its
configuration was not recorded since the recorder doesn't record
resources of this type.

=item *

ResourceDeleted E<ndash> The resource was deleted

=item *

configuration was not recorded since the recorder doesn't record
resources of this type.

=back



=head2 ConfigurationStateId => Str
