=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::ConfigRule

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::ConfigRule object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ConfigRuleArn => $value, ..., Source => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::ConfigRule object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ConfigRuleArn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Config rules evaluate the configuration settings of your Amazon Web
Services resources. A rule can run when Config detects a configuration
change to an Amazon Web Services resource or at a periodic frequency
that you choose (for example, every 24 hours). There are two types of
rules: I<Config Managed Rules> and I<Config Custom Rules>.

Config Managed Rules are predefined, customizable rules created by
Config. For a list of managed rules, see List of Config Managed Rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).

Config Custom Rules are rules that you create from scratch. There are
two ways to create Config custom rules: with Lambda functions ( Lambda
Developer Guide
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-function))
and with Guard (Guard GitHub Repository
(https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)), a
policy-as-code language. Config custom rules created with Lambda are
called I<Config Custom Lambda Rules> and Config custom rules created
with Guard are called I<Config Custom Policy Rules>.

For more information about developing and using Config rules, see
Evaluating Resource with Config Rules
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config.html)
in the I<Config Developer Guide>.

You can use the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs if
you want to create a rule that triggers evaluations for your resources
when Config delivers the configuration snapshot. For more information,
see ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 ConfigRuleArn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Config rule.


=head2 ConfigRuleId => Str

The ID of the Config rule.


=head2 ConfigRuleName => Str

The name that you assign to the Config rule. The name is required if
you are adding a new rule.


=head2 ConfigRuleState => Str

Indicates whether the Config rule is active or is currently being
deleted by Config. It can also indicate the evaluation status for the
Config rule.

Config sets the state of the rule to C<EVALUATING> temporarily after
you use the C<StartConfigRulesEvaluation> request to evaluate your
resources against the Config rule.

Config sets the state of the rule to C<DELETING_RESULTS> temporarily
after you use the C<DeleteEvaluationResults> request to delete the
current evaluation results for the Config rule.

Config temporarily sets the state of a rule to C<DELETING> after you
use the C<DeleteConfigRule> request to delete the rule. After Config
deletes the rule, the rule and all of its evaluations are erased and
are no longer available.


=head2 CreatedBy => Str

Service principal name of the service that created the rule.

The field is populated only if the service-linked rule is created by a
service. The field is empty if you create your own rule.


=head2 Description => Str

The description that you provide for the Config rule.


=head2 EvaluationModes => ArrayRef[L<Paws::Config::EvaluationModeConfiguration>]

The modes the Config rule can be evaluated in. The valid values are
distinct objects. By default, the value is Detective evaluation mode
only.


=head2 InputParameters => Str

A string, in JSON format, that is passed to the Config rule Lambda
function.


=head2 MaximumExecutionFrequency => Str

The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a rule.
You can specify a value for C<MaximumExecutionFrequency> when:

=over

=item *

This is for an Config managed rule that is triggered at a periodic
frequency.

=item *

Your custom rule is triggered when Config delivers the configuration
snapshot. For more information, see ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties.

=back

By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every 24 hours.
To change the frequency, specify a valid value for the
C<MaximumExecutionFrequency> parameter.


=head2 Scope => L<Paws::Config::Scope>

Defines which resources can trigger an evaluation for the rule. The
scope can include one or more resource types, a combination of one
resource type and one resource ID, or a combination of a tag key and
value. Specify a scope to constrain the resources that can trigger an
evaluation for the rule. If you do not specify a scope, evaluations are
triggered when any resource in the recording group changes.

The scope can be empty.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> Source => L<Paws::Config::Source>

Provides the rule owner (C<Amazon Web Services> for managed rules,
C<CUSTOM_POLICY> for Custom Policy rules, and C<CUSTOM_LAMBDA> for
Custom Lambda rules), the rule identifier, and the notifications that
cause the function to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.
