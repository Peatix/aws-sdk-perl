=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::Evaluation

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::Evaluation object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Annotation => $value, ..., OrderingTimestamp => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::Evaluation object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Annotation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Identifies an Amazon Web Services resource and indicates whether it
complies with the Config rule that it was evaluated against.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Annotation => Str

Supplementary information about how the evaluation determined the
compliance.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComplianceResourceId => Str

The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComplianceResourceType => Str

The type of Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> ComplianceType => Str

Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services resource complies with the
Config rule that it was evaluated against.

For the C<Evaluation> data type, Config supports only the C<COMPLIANT>,
C<NON_COMPLIANT>, and C<NOT_APPLICABLE> values. Config does not support
the C<INSUFFICIENT_DATA> value for this data type.

Similarly, Config does not accept C<INSUFFICIENT_DATA> as the value for
C<ComplianceType> from a C<PutEvaluations> request. For example, an
Lambda function for a custom Config rule cannot pass an
C<INSUFFICIENT_DATA> value to Config.


=head2 B<REQUIRED> OrderingTimestamp => Str

The time of the event in Config that triggered the evaluation. For
event-based evaluations, the time indicates when Config created the
configuration item that triggered the evaluation. For periodic
evaluations, the time indicates when Config triggered the evaluation at
the frequency that you specified (for example, every 24 hours).
