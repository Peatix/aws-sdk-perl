Paws::Config::AggregateComplianceByConformancePack

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::AggregateComplianceByConformancePack object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AccountId => $value, ..., ConformancePackName => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::AggregateComplianceByConformancePack object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AccountId

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides aggregate compliance of the conformance pack. Indicates
whether a conformance pack is compliant based on the name of the
conformance pack, account ID, and region.

A conformance pack is compliant if all of the rules in a conformance
packs are compliant. It is noncompliant if any of the rules are not
compliant. The compliance status of a conformance pack is
INSUFFICIENT_DATA only if all rules within a conformance pack cannot be
evaluated due to insufficient data. If some of the rules in a
conformance pack are compliant but the compliance status of other rules
in that same conformance pack is INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the conformance
pack shows compliant.
