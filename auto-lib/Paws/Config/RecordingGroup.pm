=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::RecordingGroup

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::RecordingGroup object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { AllSupported => $value, ..., ResourceTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::RecordingGroup object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->AllSupported

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies which resource types Config records for configuration
changes. By default, Config records configuration changes for all
current and future supported resource types in the Amazon Web Services
Region where you have enabled Config, excluding the global IAM resource
types: IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies.

In the recording group, you specify whether you want to record all
supported current and future supported resource types or to include or
exclude specific resources types. For a list of supported resource
types, see Supported Resource Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources)
in the I<Config developer guide>.

If you don't want Config to record all current and future supported
resource types (excluding the global IAM resource types), use one of
the following recording strategies:

=over

=item 1.

B<Record all current and future resource types with exclusions>
(C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>), or

=item 2.

B<Record specific resource types> (C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>).

=back

If you use the recording strategy to B<Record all current and future
resource types> (C<ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES>), you can use the flag
C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> to include the global IAM resource types
in your recording.

B<Aurora global clusters are recorded in all enabled Regions>

The C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster> resource type will be recorded in all
supported Config Regions where the configuration recorder is enabled.

If you do not want to record C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster> in all enabled
Regions, use the C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> or
C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> recording strategy.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 AllSupported => Bool

Specifies whether Config records configuration changes for all
supported resource types, excluding the global IAM resource types.

If you set this field to C<true>, when Config adds support for a new
resource type, Config starts recording resources of that type
automatically.

If you set this field to C<true>, you cannot enumerate specific
resource types to record in the C<resourceTypes> field of
RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html),
or to exclude in the C<resourceTypes> field of ExclusionByResourceTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ExclusionByResourceTypes.html).

B<Region availability>

Check Resource Coverage by Region Availability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/what-is-resource-config-coverage.html)
to see if a resource type is supported in the Amazon Web Services
Region where you set up Config.


=head2 ExclusionByResourceTypes => L<Paws::Config::ExclusionByResourceTypes>

An object that specifies how Config excludes resource types from being
recorded by the configuration recorder.

B<Required fields>

To use this option, you must set the C<useOnly> field of
RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>.


=head2 IncludeGlobalResourceTypes => Bool

This option is a bundle which only applies to the global IAM resource
types: IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies. These
global IAM resource types can only be recorded by Config in Regions
where Config was available before February 2022. You cannot be record
the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported by Config after
February 2022. For a list of those Regions, see Recording Amazon Web
Services Resources | Global Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-all).

B<Aurora global clusters are recorded in all enabled Regions>

The C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster> resource type will be recorded in all
supported Config Regions where the configuration recorder is enabled,
even if C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> is setC<false>. The
C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> option is a bundle which only applies to
IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies.

If you do not want to record C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster> in all enabled
Regions, use one of the following recording strategies:

=over

=item 1.

B<Record all current and future resource types with exclusions>
(C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>), or

=item 2.

B<Record specific resource types> (C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>).

=back

For more information, see Selecting Which Resources are Recorded
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-all)
in the I<Config developer guide>.

B<includeGlobalResourceTypes and the exclusion recording strategy>

The C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> field has no impact on the
C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> recording strategy. This means that the
global IAM resource types (IAM users, groups, roles, and customer
managed policies) will not be automatically added as exclusions for
C<exclusionByResourceTypes> when C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> is set
to C<false>.

The C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> field should only be used to modify
the C<AllSupported> field, as the default for the C<AllSupported> field
is to record configuration changes for all supported resource types
excluding the global IAM resource types. To include the global IAM
resource types when C<AllSupported> is set to C<true>, make sure to set
C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> to C<true>.

To exclude the global IAM resource types for the
C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> recording strategy, you need to manually
add them to the C<resourceTypes> field of C<exclusionByResourceTypes>.

B<Required and optional fields>

Before you set this field to C<true>, set the C<allSupported> field of
RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>. Optionally, you can set the C<useOnly> field of
RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES>.

B<Overriding fields>

If you set this field to C<false> but list global IAM resource types in
the C<resourceTypes> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html),
Config will still record configuration changes for those specified
resource types I<regardless> of if you set the
C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> field to false.

If you do not want to record configuration changes to the global IAM
resource types (IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed
policies), make sure to not list them in the C<resourceTypes> field in
addition to setting the C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> field to false.


=head2 RecordingStrategy => L<Paws::Config::RecordingStrategy>

An object that specifies the recording strategy for the configuration
recorder.

=over

=item *

If you set the C<useOnly> field of RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config records configuration
changes for all supported resource types, excluding the global IAM
resource types. You also must set the C<allSupported> field of
RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>. When Config adds support for a new resource type, Config
automatically starts recording resources of that type.

=item *

If you set the C<useOnly> field of RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config records configuration changes
for only the resource types you specify in the C<resourceTypes> field
of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html).

=item *

If you set the C<useOnly> field of RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config records configuration changes
for all supported resource types except the resource types that you
specify to exclude from being recorded in the C<resourceTypes> field of
ExclusionByResourceTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ExclusionByResourceTypes.html).

=back

B<Required and optional fields>

The C<recordingStrategy> field is optional when you set the
C<allSupported> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>.

The C<recordingStrategy> field is optional when you list resource types
in the C<resourceTypes> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html).

The C<recordingStrategy> field is required if you list resource types
to exclude from recording in the C<resourceTypes> field of
ExclusionByResourceTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ExclusionByResourceTypes.html).

B<Overriding fields>

If you choose C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> for the recording
strategy, the C<exclusionByResourceTypes> field will override other
properties in the request.

For example, even if you set C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> to false,
global IAM resource types will still be automatically recorded in this
option unless those resource types are specifically listed as
exclusions in the C<resourceTypes> field of
C<exclusionByResourceTypes>.

B<Global resources types and the resource exclusion recording strategy>

By default, if you choose the C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> recording
strategy, when Config adds support for a new resource type in the
Region where you set up the configuration recorder, including global
resource types, Config starts recording resources of that type
automatically.

Unless specifically listed as exclusions, C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster>
will be recorded automatically in all supported Config Regions were the
configuration recorder is enabled.

IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies will be
recorded in the Region where you set up the configuration recorder if
that is a Region where Config was available before February 2022. You
cannot be record the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported by
Config after February 2022. For a list of those Regions, see Recording
Amazon Web Services Resources | Global Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-all).


=head2 ResourceTypes => ArrayRef[Str|Undef]

A comma-separated list that specifies which resource types Config
records.

For a list of valid C<resourceTypes> values, see the B<Resource Type
Value> column in Supported Amazon Web Services resource Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources)
in the I<Config developer guide>.

B<Required and optional fields>

Optionally, you can set the C<useOnly> field of RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>.

To record all configuration changes, set the C<allSupported> field of
RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>, and either omit this field or don't specify any resource
types in this field. If you set the C<allSupported> field to C<false>
and specify values for C<resourceTypes>, when Config adds support for a
new type of resource, it will not record resources of that type unless
you manually add that type to your recording group.

B<Region availability>

Before specifying a resource type for Config to track, check Resource
Coverage by Region Availability
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/what-is-resource-config-coverage.html)
to see if the resource type is supported in the Amazon Web Services
Region where you set up Config. If a resource type is supported by
Config in at least one Region, you can enable the recording of that
resource type in all Regions supported by Config, even if the specified
resource type is not supported in the Amazon Web Services Region where
you set up Config.
