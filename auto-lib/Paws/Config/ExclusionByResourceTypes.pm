=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::ExclusionByResourceTypes

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::ExclusionByResourceTypes object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { ResourceTypes => $value, ..., ResourceTypes => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::ExclusionByResourceTypes object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->ResourceTypes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies whether the configuration recorder excludes certain resource
types from being recorded. Use the C<resourceTypes> field to enter a
comma-separated list of resource types you want to exclude from
recording.

By default, when Config adds support for a new resource type in the
Region where you set up the configuration recorder, including global
resource types, Config starts recording resources of that type
automatically.

B<How to use the exclusion recording strategy>

To use this option, you must set the C<useOnly> field of
RecordingStrategy
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingStrategy.html)
to C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>.

Config will then record configuration changes for all supported
resource types, except the resource types that you specify to exclude
from being recorded.

B<Global resource types and the exclusion recording strategy>

Unless specifically listed as exclusions, C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster>
will be recorded automatically in all supported Config Regions were the
configuration recorder is enabled.

IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies will be
recorded in the Region where you set up the configuration recorder if
that is a Region where Config was available before February 2022. You
cannot be record the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported by
Config after February 2022. For a list of those Regions, see Recording
Amazon Web Services Resources | Global Resources
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/select-resources.html#select-resources-all).
