=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::ConfigurationRecorder

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::ConfigurationRecorder object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { Arn => $value, ..., ServicePrincipal => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::ConfigurationRecorder object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->Arn

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Records configuration changes to the resource types in scope.

For more information about the configuration recorder, see B<Working
with the Configuration Recorder>
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/stop-start-recorder.html)
in the I<Config Developer Guide>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 Arn => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified configuration recorder.


=head2 Name => Str

The name of the configuration recorder.

For customer managed configuration recorders, Config automatically
assigns the name of "default" when creating a configuration recorder if
you do not specify a name at creation time.

For service-linked configuration recorders, Config automatically
assigns a name that has the prefix "C<AWS>" to a new service-linked
configuration recorder.

B<Changing the name of a configuration recorder>

To change the name of the customer managed configuration recorder, you
must delete it and create a new customer managed configuration recorder
with a new name.

You cannot change the name of a service-linked configuration recorder.


=head2 RecordingGroup => L<Paws::Config::RecordingGroup>

Specifies which resource types are in scope for the configuration
recorder to record.

B<High Number of Config Evaluations>

You might notice increased activity in your account during your initial
month recording with Config when compared to subsequent months. During
the initial bootstrapping process, Config runs evaluations on all the
resources in your account that you have selected for Config to record.

If you are running ephemeral workloads, you may see increased activity
from Config as it records configuration changes associated with
creating and deleting these temporary resources. An I<ephemeral
workload> is a temporary use of computing resources that are loaded and
run when needed. Examples include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2) Spot Instances, Amazon EMR jobs, and Auto Scaling.

If you want to avoid the increased activity from running ephemeral
workloads, you can set up the configuration recorder to exclude these
resource types from being recorded, or run these types of workloads in
a separate account with Config turned off to avoid increased
configuration recording and rule evaluations.


=head2 RecordingMode => L<Paws::Config::RecordingMode>

Specifies the default recording frequency for the configuration
recorder. Config supports I<Continuous recording> and I<Daily
recording>.

=over

=item *

Continuous recording allows you to record configuration changes
continuously whenever a change occurs.

=item *

Daily recording allows you to receive a configuration item (CI)
representing the most recent state of your resources over the last
24-hour period, only if itE<rsquo>s different from the previous CI
recorded.

=back

B<Some resource types require continuous recording>

Firewall Manager depends on continuous recording to monitor your
resources. If you are using Firewall Manager, it is recommended that
you set the recording frequency to Continuous.

You can also override the recording frequency for specific resource
types.


=head2 RecordingScope => Str

Specifies whether the ConfigurationItems
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ConfigurationItem.html)
in scope for the specified configuration recorder are recorded for free
(C<INTERNAL>) or if it impacts the costs to your bill (C<PAID>).


=head2 RoleARN => Str

The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role assumed by Config and
used by the specified configuration recorder.

B<The server will reject a request without a defined C<roleARN> for the
configuration recorder>

While the API model does not require this field, the server will reject
a request without a defined C<roleARN> for the configuration recorder.

B<Policies and compliance results>

IAM policies
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html)
and other policies managed in Organizations
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies.html)
can impact whether Config has permissions to record configuration
changes for your resources. Additionally, rules directly evaluate the
configuration of a resource and rules don't take into account these
policies when running evaluations. Make sure that the policies in
effect align with how you intend to use Config.

B<Keep Minimum Permisions When Reusing an IAM role>

If you use an Amazon Web Services service that uses Config, such as
Security Hub or Control Tower, and an IAM role has already been
created, make sure that the IAM role that you use when setting up
Config keeps the same minimum permissions as the pre-existing IAM role.
You must do this to ensure that the other Amazon Web Services service
continues to run as expected.

For example, if Control Tower has an IAM role that allows Config to
read S3 objects, make sure that the same permissions are granted to the
IAM role you use when setting up Config. Otherwise, it may interfere
with how Control Tower operates.

B<The service-linked IAM role for Config must be used for
service-linked configuration recorders>

For service-linked configuration recorders, you must use the
service-linked IAM role for Config: AWSServiceRoleForConfig
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/using-service-linked-roles.html).


=head2 ServicePrincipal => Str

For service-linked configuration recorders, specifies the linked Amazon
Web Services service for the configuration recorder.
