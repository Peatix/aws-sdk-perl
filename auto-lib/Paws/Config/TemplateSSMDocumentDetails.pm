=head1 DESCRIPTION

This API allows you to create a conformance pack template with an
Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM document). To deploy
a conformance pack using an SSM document, first create an SSM document
with conformance pack content, and then provide the C<DocumentName> in
the PutConformancePack API
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_PutConformancePack.html).
You can also provide the C<DocumentVersion>.

The C<TemplateSSMDocumentDetails> object contains the name of the SSM
document and the version of the SSM document.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 B<REQUIRED> DocumentName => Str

The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SSM document to use to
create a conformance pack. If you use the document name, Config checks
only your account and Amazon Web Services Region for the SSM document.


=head2 DocumentVersion => Str

The version of the SSM document to use to create a conformance pack. By
default, Config uses the latest version.

This field is optional.
