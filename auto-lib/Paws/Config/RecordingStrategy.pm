=head1 NAME

Paws::Config::RecordingStrategy

=head1 USAGE

This class represents one of two things:

=head3 Arguments in a call to a service

Use the attributes of this class as arguments to methods. You shouldn't make instances of this class. 
Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the calls that expect this type of object.

As an example, if Att1 is expected to be a Paws::Config::RecordingStrategy object:

  $service_obj->Method(Att1 => { UseOnly => $value, ..., UseOnly => $value  });

=head3 Results returned from an API call

Use accessors for each attribute. If Att1 is expected to be an Paws::Config::RecordingStrategy object:

  $result = $service_obj->Method(...);
  $result->Att1->UseOnly

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Specifies the recording strategy of the configuration recorder.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 UseOnly => Str

The recording strategy for the configuration recorder.

=item *

If you set this option to C<ALL_SUPPORTED_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config
records configuration changes for all supported resource types,
excluding the global IAM resource types. You also must set the
C<allSupported> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>. When Config adds support for a new resource type, Config
automatically starts recording resources of that type. For a list of
supported resource types, see Supported Resource Types
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources)
in the I<Config developer guide>.

=item *

If you set this option to C<INCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config
records configuration changes for only the resource types that you
specify in the C<resourceTypes> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html).

=item *

If you set this option to C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES>, Config
records configuration changes for all supported resource types, except
the resource types that you specify to exclude from being recorded in
the C<resourceTypes> field of ExclusionByResourceTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ExclusionByResourceTypes.html).

B<Required and optional fields>

The C<recordingStrategy> field is optional when you set the
C<allSupported> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html)
to C<true>.

The C<recordingStrategy> field is optional when you list resource types
in the C<resourceTypes> field of RecordingGroup
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_RecordingGroup.html).

The C<recordingStrategy> field is required if you list resource types
to exclude from recording in the C<resourceTypes> field of
ExclusionByResourceTypes
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/APIReference/API_ExclusionByResourceTypes.html).

B<Overriding fields>

If you choose C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> for the recording
strategy, the C<exclusionByResourceTypes> field will override other
properties in the request.

For example, even if you set C<includeGlobalResourceTypes> to false,
global IAM resource types will still be automatically recorded in this
option unless those resource types are specifically listed as
exclusions in the C<resourceTypes> field of
C<exclusionByResourceTypes>.

B<Global resource types and the exclusion recording strategy>

By default, if you choose the C<EXCLUSION_BY_RESOURCE_TYPES> recording
strategy, when Config adds support for a new resource type in the
Region where you set up the configuration recorder, including global
resource types, Config starts recording resources of that type
automatically.

Unless specifically listed as exclusions, C<AWS::RDS::GlobalCluster>
will be recorded automatically in all supported Config Regions were the
configuration recorder is enabled.

IAM users, groups, roles, and customer managed policies will be
recorded in the Region where you set up the configuration recorder if
that is a Region where Config was available before February 2022. You
cannot be record the global IAM resouce types in Regions supported by
Config after February 2022. This list where you cannot record the
global IAM resource types includes the following Regions:
